<p><b>Authors:</b> Mubashir ul Islam, Humza Sami, Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon, Valerio Tenace</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are computational models capable of performing complex natural language processing tasks. Leveraging these capabilities, LLMs hold the potential to transform the entire hardware design stack, with predictions suggesting that front-end and back-end tasks could be fully automated in the near future. Currently, LLMs show great promise in streamlining Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation, enhancing efficiency, and accelerating innovation. However, their probabilistic nature makes them prone to inaccuracies - a significant drawback in RTL design, where reliability and precision are essential.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces AIvril, an advanced framework designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of RTL-aware LLMs. AIvril employs a multi-agent, LLM-agnostic system for automatic syntax correction and functional verification, significantly reducing - and in many cases, completely eliminating - instances of erroneous code generation. Experimental results conducted on the VerilogEval-Human dataset show that our framework improves code quality by nearly 2x when compared to previous works, while achieving an 88.46% success rate in meeting verification objectives. This represents a critical step toward automating and optimizing hardware design workflows, offering a more dependable methodology for AI-driven RTL design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosemarie Santa Gonzalez, Ryan Piansky, Sue M Bae, Justin Biddle, Daniel Molzahn</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization hold substantial promise for improving the efficiency, reliability, and resilience of engineered systems. Due to the networked nature of many engineered systems, ethically deploying methodologies at this intersection poses challenges that are distinct from other AI settings, thus motivating the development of ethical guidelines tailored to AI-enabled optimization. This paper highlights the need to go beyond fairness-driven algorithms to systematically address ethical decisions spanning the stages of modeling, data curation, results analysis, and implementation of optimization-based decision support tools. Accordingly, this paper identifies ethical considerations required when deploying algorithms at the intersection of AI and optimization via case studies in power systems as well as supply chain and logistics. Rather than providing a prescriptive set of rules, this paper aims to foster reflection and awareness among researchers and encourage consideration of ethical implications at every step of the decision-making process.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11527">Improving LLM Reasoning with Multi-Agent Tree-of-Thought Validator Agent</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Haji, Mazal Bethany, Maryam Tabar, Jason Chiang, Anthony Rios, Peyman Najafirad</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent strategies have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning specialized roles in the problem-solving process. Concurrently, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) methods have shown potential in improving reasoning for complex question-answering tasks by exploring diverse reasoning paths. A critical limitation in multi-agent reasoning is the 'Reasoner' agent's shallow exploration of reasoning paths. While ToT strategies could help mitigate this problem, they may generate flawed reasoning branches, which could harm the trustworthiness of the final answer. To leverage the strengths of both multi-agent reasoning and ToT strategies, we introduce a novel approach combining ToT-based Reasoner agents with a Thought Validator agent. Multiple Reasoner agents operate in parallel, employing ToT to explore diverse reasoning paths. The Thought Validator then scrutinizes these paths, considering a Reasoner's conclusion only if its reasoning is valid. This method enables a more robust voting strategy by discarding faulty reasoning paths, enhancing the system's ability to tackle tasks requiring systematic and trustworthy reasoning. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques when evaluated on the GSM8K dataset, outperforming the standard ToT strategy by an average 5.6\% across four LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ari Gestetner, Buser Say</p>
<p>Abstract: A pandemic is the spread of a disease across large regions, and can have devastating costs to the society in terms of health, economic and social. As such, the study of effective pandemic mitigation strategies can yield significant positive impact on the society. A pandemic can be mathematically described using a compartmental model, such as the Susceptible Infected Removed (SIR) model. In this paper, we extend the solution equations of the SIR model to a state transition model with lockdowns. We formalize a metric hybrid planning problem based on this state transition model, and solve it using a metric hybrid planner. We improve the runtime effectiveness of the metric hybrid planner with the addition of valid inequalities, and demonstrate the success of our approach both theoretically and experimentally under various challenging settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadi Tasdighi Kalat, Sriram Sankaranarayanan, Ashutosh Trivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an approach for systematically anticipating the actions and policies employed by \emph{oblivious} environments in concurrent stochastic games, while maximizing a reward function. Our main contribution lies in the synthesis of a finite \emph{information state machine} whose alphabet ranges over the actions of the environment. Each state of the automaton is mapped to a belief state about the policy used by the environment. We introduce a notion of consistency that guarantees that the belief states tracked by our automaton stays within a fixed distance of the precise belief state obtained by knowledge of the full history. We provide methods for checking consistency of an automaton and a synthesis approach which upon successful termination yields such a machine. We show how the information state machine yields an MDP that serves as the starting point for computing optimal policies for maximizing a reward function defined over plays. We present an experimental evaluation over benchmark examples including human activity data for tasks such as cataract surgery and furniture assembly, wherein our approach successfully anticipates the policies and actions of the environment in order to maximize the reward.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11675">Towards Explainable Goal Recognition Using Weight of Evidence (WoE): A Human-Centered Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abeer Alshehri, Amal Abdulrahman, Hajar Alamri, Tim Miller, Mor Vered</p>
<p>Abstract: Goal recognition (GR) involves inferring an agent's unobserved goal from a sequence of observations. This is a critical problem in AI with diverse applications. Traditionally, GR has been addressed using 'inference to the best explanation' or abduction, where hypotheses about the agent's goals are generated as the most plausible explanations for observed behavior. Alternatively, some approaches enhance interpretability by ensuring that an agent's behavior aligns with an observer's expectations or by making the reasoning behind decisions more transparent. In this work, we tackle a different challenge: explaining the GR process in a way that is comprehensible to humans. We introduce and evaluate an explainable model for goal recognition (GR) agents, grounded in the theoretical framework and cognitive processes underlying human behavior explanation. Drawing on insights from two human-agent studies, we propose a conceptual framework for human-centered explanations of GR. Using this framework, we develop the eXplainable Goal Recognition (XGR) model, which generates explanations for both why and why not questions. We evaluate the model computationally across eight GR benchmarks and through three user studies. The first study assesses the efficiency of generating human-like explanations within the Sokoban game domain, the second examines perceived explainability in the same domain, and the third evaluates the model's effectiveness in aiding decision-making in illegal fishing detection. Results demonstrate that the XGR model significantly enhances user understanding, trust, and decision-making compared to baseline models, underscoring its potential to improve human-agent collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Sartor, Angelo Oddi, Riccardo Rasconi, Vieri Giuliano Santucci, Rosa Meo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, AI systems have made remarkable progress in various tasks. Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) is an effective tool for agents to learn policies in low-level state spaces to solve highly complex tasks. Researchers have introduced Intrinsic Motivation(IM) to the RL mechanism, which simulates the agent's curiosity, encouraging agents to explore interesting areas of the environment. This new feature has proved vital in enabling agents to learn policies without being given specific goals. However, even though DRL intelligence emerges through a sub-symbolic model, there is still a need for a sort of abstraction to understand the knowledge collected by the agent. To this end, the classical planning formalism has been used in recent research to explicitly represent the knowledge an autonomous agent acquires and effectively reach extrinsic goals. Despite classical planning usually presents limited expressive capabilities, PPDDL demonstrated usefulness in reviewing the knowledge gathered by an autonomous system, making explicit causal correlations, and can be exploited to find a plan to reach any state the agent faces during its experience. This work presents a new architecture implementing an open-ended learning system able to synthesize from scratch its experience into a PPDDL representation and update it over time. Without a predefined set of goals and tasks, the system integrates intrinsic motivations to explore the environment in a self-directed way, exploiting the high-level knowledge acquired during its experience. The system explores the environment and iteratively: (a) discover options, (b) explore the environment using options, (c) abstract the knowledge collected and (d) plan. This paper proposes an alternative approach to implementing open-ended learning architectures exploiting low-level and high-level representations to extend its knowledge in a virtuous loop.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11780">Explaining Non-monotonic Normative Reasoning using Argumentation Theory with Deontic Logic</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Yu, Yiwei Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In our previous research, we provided a reasoning system (called LeSAC) based on argumentation theory to provide legal support to designers during the design process. Building on this, this paper explores how to provide designers with effective explanations for their legally relevant design decisions. We extend the previous system for providing explanations by specifying norms and the key legal or ethical principles for justifying actions in normative contexts. Considering that first-order logic has strong expressive power, in the current paper we adopt a first-order deontic logic system with deontic operators and preferences. We illustrate the advantages and necessity of introducing deontic logic and designing explanations under LeSAC by modelling two cases in the context of autonomous driving. In particular, this paper also discusses the requirements of the updated LeSAC to guarantee rationality, and proves that a well-defined LeSAC can satisfy the rationality postulate for rule-based argumentation frameworks. This ensures the system's ability to provide coherent, legally valid explanations for complex design decisions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11820">Optimizing Job Shop Scheduling in the Furniture Industry: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Considering Machine Setup, Batch Variability, and Intralogistics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Schneevogt, Karsten Binninger, Noah Klarmann</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the potential application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the furniture industry. To offer a broad product portfolio, most furniture manufacturers are organized as a job shop, which ultimately results in the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The JSSP is addressed with a focus on extending traditional models to better represent the complexities of real-world production environments. Existing approaches frequently fail to consider critical factors such as machine setup times or varying batch sizes. A concept for a model is proposed that provides a higher level of information detail to enhance scheduling accuracy and efficiency. The concept introduces the integration of DRL for production planning, particularly suited to batch production industries such as the furniture industry. The model extends traditional approaches to JSSPs by including job volumes, buffer management, transportation times, and machine setup times. This enables more precise forecasting and analysis of production flows and processes, accommodating the variability and complexity inherent in real-world manufacturing processes. The RL agent learns to optimize scheduling decisions. It operates within a discrete action space, making decisions based on detailed observations. A reward function guides the agent's decision-making process, thereby promoting efficient scheduling and meeting production deadlines. Two integration strategies for implementing the RL agent are discussed: episodic planning, which is suitable for low-automation environments, and continuous planning, which is ideal for highly automated plants. While episodic planning can be employed as a standalone solution, the continuous planning approach necessitates the integration of the agent with ERP and Manufacturing Execution Systems. This integration enables real-time adjustments to production schedules based on dynamic changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Cooper, Leila Amgoud</p>
<p>Abstract: Abductive explanations (AXp's) are widely used for understanding decisions of classifiers. Existing definitions are suitable when features are independent. However, we show that ignoring constraints when they exist between features may lead to an explosion in the number of redundant or superfluous AXp's. We propose three new types of explanations that take into account constraints and that can be generated from the whole feature space or from a sample (such as a dataset). They are based on a key notion of coverage of an explanation, the set of instances it explains. We show that coverage is powerful enough to discard redundant and superfluous AXp's. For each type, we analyse the complexity of finding an explanation and investigate its formal properties. The final result is a catalogue of different forms of AXp's with different complexities and different formal guarantees.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12182">LifeGPT: Topology-Agnostic Generative Pretrained Transformer Model for Cellular Automata</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime A. Berkovich, Markus J. Buehler</p>
<p>Abstract: The Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model (LLM) framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Verma, Mert Pilanci</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the idea of applying signal processing inside a Large Language Model (LLM). With the recent explosion of generative AI, our work can help bridge two fields together, namely the field of signal processing and large language models. We draw parallels between classical Fourier-Transforms and Fourier Transform-like learnable time-frequency representations for every intermediate activation signal of an LLM. Once we decompose every activation signal across tokens into a time-frequency representation, we learn how to filter and reconstruct them, with all components learned from scratch, to predict the next token given the previous context. We show that for GPT-like architectures, our work achieves faster convergence and significantly increases performance by adding a minuscule number of extra parameters when trained for the same epochs. We hope this work paves the way for algorithms exploring signal processing inside the signals found in neural architectures like LLMs and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Internet, particularly the emergence of Web3, has transformed the ways people interact and share data. Web3, although still not well defined, is thought to be a return to the decentralization of corporations' power over user data. Despite the obsolescence of the idea of building systems to detect and prevent cyber intrusions, this is still a topic of interest. This paper proposes a novel conceptual approach for implementing decentralized collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDN) through a proof-of-concept. The study employs an analytical and comparative methodology, examining the synergy between cutting-edge Web3 technologies and information security. The proposed model incorporates blockchain concepts, cyber non-fungible token (cyberNFT) rewards, machine learning algorithms, and publish/subscribe architectures. Finally, the paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the proposed system, offering insights into the potential of decentralized cybersecurity models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xufeng Yao, Yiwen Wang, Xing Li, Yingzhao Lian, Ran Chen, Lei Chen, Mingxuan Yuan, Hong Xu, Bei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Register Transfer Level (RTL) code optimization is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and performance of digital circuits during early synthesis stages. Currently, optimization relies heavily on manual efforts by skilled engineers, often requiring multiple iterations based on synthesis feedback. In contrast, existing compiler-based methods fall short in addressing complex designs. This paper introduces RTLRewriter, an innovative framework that leverages large models to optimize RTL code. A circuit partition pipeline is utilized for fast synthesis and efficient rewriting. A multi-modal program analysis is proposed to incorporate vital visual diagram information as optimization cues. A specialized search engine is designed to identify useful optimization guides, algorithms, and code snippets that enhance the model ability to generate optimized RTL. Additionally, we introduce a Cost-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (C-MCTS) algorithm for efficient rewriting, managing diverse retrieved contents and steering the rewriting results. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline is proposed to reduce verification cost. To cater to the needs of both industry and academia, we propose two benchmarking suites: the Large Rewriter Benchmark, targeting complex scenarios with extensive circuit partitioning, optimization trade-offs, and verification challenges, and the Small Rewriter Benchmark, designed for a wider range of scenarios and patterns. Our comparative analysis with established compilers such as Yosys and E-graph demonstrates significant improvements, highlighting the benefits of integrating large models into the early stages of circuit design.

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs of large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior capability across major industries and stimulated multi-hundred-billion-dollar investment in AI-centric data centers in the next 3-5 years. This, in turn, bring the increasing concerns on sustainability and AI-related energy usage. However, there is a largely overlooked issue as challenging and critical as AI model and infrastructure efficiency: the disruptive dynamic power consumption behaviour. With fast, transient dynamics, AI infrastructure features ultra-low inertia, sharp power surge and dip, and a significant peak-idle power ratio. The power scale covers from several hundred watts to megawatts, even to gigawatts. These never-seen-before characteristics make AI a very unique load and pose threats to the power grid reliability and resilience. To reveal this hidden problem, this paper examines the scale of AI power consumption, analyzes AI transient behaviour in various scenarios, develops high-level mathematical models to depict AI workload behaviour and discusses the multifaceted challenges and opportunities they potentially bring to existing power grids. Observing the rapidly evolving machine learning (ML) and AI technologies, this work emphasizes the critical need for interdisciplinary approaches to ensure reliable and sustainable AI infrastructure development, and provides a starting point for researchers and practitioners to tackle such challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Dutta, Pavana P Karanth, Pedro Maciel Xavier, Iago Leal de Freitas, Nouhaila Innan, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique, David E. Bernal Neira</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</p>

Moreover, the 5th Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) technology is designed to accommodate a wide range of applications and industries. The NGNM 5G White Paper \cite{5gwhitepaper} groups these vertical use cases into three categories:
  - enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)
  - massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC)
  - Ultra-Reliable Low-latency Communication (URLLC).
  Partitioning the physical network into multiple virtual networks appears to be the best way to provide a customised service for each application and limit operational costs. This design is well known as \textit{network slicing}. Each drone must thus slice its bandwidth between each of the 3 user classes. This whole problem (placement + bandwidth) can be defined as an optimization problem, but since it is very hard to solve efficiently, it is almost always addressed by AI in the litterature. In my internship, I wanted to prove that viewing the problem as an optimization problem can still be useful, by building an hybrid solution involving on one hand AI and on the other optimization. I use it to achieve better results than approaches that use only AI, although at the cost of slightly larger (but still reasonable) computation times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marta Szymczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyze methods of flexible control in SDN networks and to propose a self-developed solution that will enable intelligent adaptation of SDN controller performance. This work aims not only to review existing solutions, but also to develop an approach that will increase the efficiency and adaptability of network management. The project uses a modern type of machine learning, Reinforcement Learning, which allows autonomous decisions of a network that learns based on its choices in a dynamically changing environment, which is most similar to the way humans learn. The solution aims not only to improve the network's performance, but also its flexibility and real-time adaptability - flexible traffic control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Oxygenators, alarm devices, and footsteps are some of the most common sound sources in a hospital. Detecting them has scientific value for environmental psychology but comes with challenges of its own: namely, privacy preservation and limited labeled data. In this paper, we address these two challenges via a combination of edge computing and cloud computing. For privacy preservation, we have designed an acoustic sensor which computes third-octave spectrograms on the fly instead of recording audio waveforms. For sample-efficient machine learning, we have repurposed a pretrained audio neural network (PANN) via spectral transcoding and label space adaptation. A small-scale study in a neonatological intensive care unit (NICU) confirms that the time series of detected events align with another modality of measurement: i.e., electronic badges for parents and healthcare professionals. Hence, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of polyphonic machine listening in a hospital ward while guaranteeing privacy by design.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a Mamba accelerator with reconfigurable architecture, MARCA.We propose three novel approaches in this paper. (1) Reduction alternative PE array architecture for both linear and element-wise operations. For linear operations, the reduction tree connected to PE arrays is enabled and executes the reduction operation. For element-wise operations, the reduction tree is disabled and the output bypasses. (2) Reusable nonlinear function unit based on the reconfigurable PE. We decompose the exponential function into element-wise operations and a shift operation by a fast biased exponential algorithm, and the activation function (SiLU) into a range detection and element-wise operations by a piecewise approximation algorithm. Thus, the reconfigurable PEs are reused to execute nonlinear functions with negligible accuracy loss.(3) Intra-operation and inter-operation buffer management strategy. We propose intra-operation buffer management strategy to maximize input data sharing for linear operations within operations, and inter-operation strategy for element-wise operations between operations. We conduct extensive experiments on Mamba model families with different sizes.MARCA achieves up to 463.22$\times$/11.66$\times$ speedup and up to 9761.42$\times$/242.52$\times$ energy efficiency compared to Intel Xeon 8358P CPU and NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU implementations, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Ben Driss, Essaid Sabir, Halima Elbiaze, Abdoulaye Banir\'e Diallo, Mohamed Sadik</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention across various industries for its capability to train machine learning models without centralizing sensitive data. While this approach offers significant benefits such as privacy preservation and decreased communication overhead, it presents several challenges, including deployment complexity and interoperability issues, particularly in heterogeneous scenarios or resource-constrained environments. Over-the-air (OTA) FL was introduced to tackle these challenges by disseminating model updates without necessitating direct device-to-device connections or centralized servers. However, OTA-FL brought forth limitations associated with heightened energy consumption and network latency. In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute client selection framework employing the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to strategically control the number of participants in each round and optimize the OTA-FL process while considering accuracy, energy, delay, reliability, and fairness constraints of participating devices. We evaluate the performance of our multi-attribute client selection approach in terms of model loss minimization, convergence time reduction, and energy efficiency. In our experimental evaluation, we assessed and compared the performance of our approach against the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GWO-based client selection outperforms these baselines across various metrics. Specifically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in model loss, accelerates convergence time, and enhances energy efficiency while maintaining high fairness and reliability indicators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emet Bethany, Mazal Bethany, Juan Arturo Nolazco Flores, Sumit Kumar Jha, Peyman Najafirad</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in AI safety have led to increased efforts in training and red-teaming large language models (LLMs) to mitigate unsafe content generation. However, these safety mechanisms may not be comprehensive, leaving potential vulnerabilities unexplored. This paper introduces MathPrompt, a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits LLMs' advanced capabilities in symbolic mathematics to bypass their safety mechanisms. By encoding harmful natural language prompts into mathematical problems, we demonstrate a critical vulnerability in current AI safety measures. Our experiments across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal an average attack success rate of 73.6\%, highlighting the inability of existing safety training mechanisms to generalize to mathematically encoded inputs. Analysis of embedding vectors shows a substantial semantic shift between original and encoded prompts, helping explain the attack's success. This work emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to AI safety, calling for expanded red-teaming efforts to develop robust safeguards across all potential input types and their associated risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannis Vasilakis, Rachel Bittner, Johan Pauwels</p>
<p>Abstract: Music-text multimodal systems have enabled new approaches to Music Information Research (MIR) applications such as audio-to-text and text-to-audio retrieval, text-based song generation, and music captioning. Despite the reported success, little effort has been put into evaluating the musical knowledge of Large Language Models (LLM). In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs suffer from 1) prompt sensitivity, 2) inability to model negation (e.g. 'rock song without guitar'), and 3) sensitivity towards the presence of specific words. We quantified these properties as a triplet-based accuracy, evaluating the ability to model the relative similarity of labels in a hierarchical ontology. We leveraged the Audioset ontology to generate triplets consisting of an anchor, a positive (relevant) label, and a negative (less relevant) label for the genre and instruments sub-tree. We evaluated the triplet-based musical knowledge for six general-purpose Transformer-based models. The triplets obtained through this methodology required filtering, as some were difficult to judge and therefore relatively uninformative for evaluation purposes. Despite the relatively high accuracy reported, inconsistencies are evident in all six models, suggesting that off-the-shelf LLMs need adaptation to music before use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Awj Twam, Megan Jacobsen, Rachel Glenn, Ann Klopp, Aradhana M. Venkatesan, David Fuentes</p>
<p>Abstract: Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common malignancy amongst women worldwide.1 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) serves as the mainstay definitive treatment regimen for locally advanced cervical cancers and includes external beam radiation followed by brachytherapy.2 Integral to radiotherapy treatment planning is the routine contouring of both the target tumor at the level of the cervix, associated gynecologic anatomy and the adjacent organs at risk (OARs). However, manual contouring of these structures is both time and labor intensive and associated with known interobserver variability that can impact treatment outcomes. While multiple tools have been developed to automatically segment OARs and the high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV) using computed tomography (CT) images,3,4,5,6 the development of deep learning-based tumor segmentation tools using routine T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) addresses an unmet clinical need to improve the routine contouring of both anatomical structures and cervical cancers, thereby increasing quality and consistency of radiotherapy planning. This work applied a novel deep-learning model (PocketNet) to segment the cervix, vagina, uterus, and tumor(s) on T2w MRI. The performance of the PocketNet architecture was evaluated, when trained on data via 5-fold cross validation. PocketNet achieved a mean Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficient (DSC) exceeding 70% for tumor segmentation and 80% for organ segmentation. These results suggest that PocketNet is robust to variations in contrast protocols, providing reliable segmentation of the ROIs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilaria Manco, Justin Salamon, Oriol Nieto</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-text contrastive models have become a powerful approach in music representation learning. Despite their empirical success, however, little is known about the influence of key design choices on the quality of music-text representations learnt through this framework. In this work, we expose these design choices within the constraints of limited data and computation budgets, and establish a more solid understanding of their impact grounded in empirical observations along three axes: the choice of base encoders, the level of curation in training data, and the use of text augmentation. We find that data curation is the single most important factor for music-text contrastive training in resource-constrained scenarios. Motivated by this insight, we introduce two novel techniques, Augmented View Dropout and TextSwap, which increase the diversity and descriptiveness of text inputs seen in training. Through our experiments we demonstrate that these are effective at boosting performance across different pre-training regimes, model architectures, and downstream data distributions, without incurring higher computational costs or requiring additional training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a technique for multi-document grounded multi-turn synthetic dialog generation that incorporates three main ideas. First, we control the overall dialog flow using taxonomy-driven user queries that are generated with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Second, we support the generation of multi-document grounded dialogs by mimicking real-world use of retrievers to update the grounding documents after every user-turn in the dialog. Third, we apply LLM-as-a-Judge to filter out queries with incorrect answers. Human evaluation of the synthetic dialog data suggests that the data is diverse, coherent, and includes mostly correct answers. Both human and automatic evaluations of answerable queries indicate that models fine-tuned on synthetic dialogs consistently out-perform those fine-tuned on existing human generated training data across four publicly available multi-turn document grounded benchmark test sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menan Velayuthan, Kengatharaiyer Sarveswaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenizers act as a bridge between human language and the latent space of language models, influencing how language is represented in these models. Due to the immense popularity of English-Centric Large Language Models (LLMs), efforts are being made to adapt them for other languages. However, we demonstrate that, from a tokenization standpoint, not all tokenizers offer fair representation for complex script languages such as Tamil, Sinhala, and Hindi, primarily due to the choice of pre-tokenization methods. We go further to show that pre-tokenization plays a more critical role than the tokenization algorithm itself in achieving an egalitarian representation of these complex script languages. To address this, we introduce an improvement to the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm by incorporating graphemes, which we term Grapheme Pair Encoding (GPE). Our experiments show that grapheme-based character extraction outperforms byte-level tokenizers for complex scripts. We validate this approach through experiments on Tamil, Sinhala, and Hindi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Li, Xiaoqi Wang, Hong-You Chen, Han-Wei Shen, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has rapidly evolved as a promising paradigm that enables collaborative model training across distributed participants without exchanging their local data. Despite its broad applications in fields such as computer vision, graph learning, and natural language processing, the development of a data projection model that can be effectively used to visualize data in the context of FL is crucial yet remains heavily under-explored. Neighbor embedding (NE) is an essential technique for visualizing complex high-dimensional data, but collaboratively learning a joint NE model is difficult. The key challenge lies in the objective function, as effective visualization algorithms like NE require computing loss functions among pairs of data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FedNE}, a novel approach that integrates the \textsc{FedAvg} framework with the contrastive NE technique, without any requirements of shareable data. To address the lack of inter-client repulsion which is crucial for the alignment in the global embedding space, we develop a surrogate loss function that each client learns and shares with each other. Additionally, we propose a data-mixing strategy to augment the local data, aiming to relax the problems of invisible neighbors and false neighbors constructed by the local $k$NN graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our \textsc{FedNE} can effectively preserve the neighborhood data structures and enhance the alignment in the global embedding space compared to several baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhikang Dong, Apoorva Beedu, Jason Sheinkopf, Irfan Essa</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for generalizing across diverse tasks and using language cues to enhance learning. While transformer-based architectures have been the de facto in vision-language training, they face challenges like quadratic computational complexity, high GPU memory usage, and difficulty with long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaVL, a novel model that leverages recent advancements in selective state space modality fusion to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and learn joint representations for vision and language data. MambaVL utilizes a shared state transition matrix across both modalities, allowing the model to capture information about actions from multiple perspectives within the scene. Furthermore, we propose a question-answering task that helps guide the model toward relevant cues. These questions provide critical information about actions, objects, and environmental context, leading to enhanced performance. As a result, MambaVL achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition on the Epic-Kitchens-100 dataset and outperforms baseline methods in action anticipation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrey Ignatov, Grigory Malivenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been proposed for histopathological image analysis over the past years. While they usually demonstrate exceptionally high accuracy, one key question is whether their precision might be affected by low-level image properties not related to histopathology but caused by microscopy image handling and pre-processing. In this paper, we analyze a popular NCT-CRC-HE-100K colorectal cancer dataset used in numerous prior works and show that both this dataset and the obtained results may be affected by data-specific biases. The most prominent revealed dataset issues are inappropriate color normalization, severe JPEG artifacts inconsistent between different classes, and completely corrupted tissue samples resulting from incorrect image dynamic range handling. We show that even the simplest model using only 3 features per image (red, green and blue color intensities) can demonstrate over 50% accuracy on this 9-class dataset, while using color histogram not explicitly capturing cell morphology features yields over 82% accuracy. Moreover, we show that a basic EfficientNet-B0 ImageNet pretrained model can achieve over 97.7% accuracy on this dataset, outperforming all previously proposed solutions developed for this task, including dedicated foundation histopathological models and large cell morphology-aware neural networks. The NCT-CRC-HE dataset is publicly available and can be freely used to replicate the presented results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillermo Marco, Luz Rello, Julio Gonzalo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the creative fiction writing abilities of a fine-tuned small language model (SLM), BART Large, and compare its performance to humans and two large language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our evaluation consists of two experiments: (i) a human evaluation where readers assess the stories generated by the SLM compared to human-written stories, and (ii) a qualitative linguistic analysis comparing the textual characteristics of the stories generated by the different models. In the first experiment, we asked 68 participants to rate short stories generated by the models and humans along dimensions such as grammaticality, relevance, creativity, and attractiveness. BART Large outperformed human writers in most aspects, except creativity, with an overall score of 2.11 compared to 1.85 for human-written texts -- a 14% improvement. In the second experiment, the qualitative analysis revealed that, while GPT-4o exhibited near-perfect internal and external coherence, it tended to produce more predictable narratives, with only 3% of its stories seen as novel. In contrast, 15% of BART's stories were considered novel, indicating a higher degree of creativity despite its smaller model size. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative insights into how model size and fine-tuning influence the balance between creativity, fluency, and coherence in creative writing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armand Collin, Arthur Boschet, Mathieu Boudreau, Julien Cohen-Adad</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying axon and myelin properties (e.g., axon diameter, myelin thickness, g-ratio) in histology images can provide useful information about microstructural changes caused by neurodegenerative diseases. Automatic tissue segmentation is an important tool for these datasets, as a single stained section can contain up to thousands of axons. Advances in deep learning have made this task quick and reliable with minimal overhead, but a deep learning model trained by one research group will hardly ever be usable by other groups due to differences in their histology training data. This is partly due to subject diversity (different body parts, species, genetics, pathologies) and also to the range of modern microscopy imaging techniques resulting in a wide variability of image features (i.e., contrast, resolution). There is a pressing need to make AI accessible to neuroscience researchers to facilitate and accelerate their workflow, but publicly available models are scarce and poorly maintained. Our approach is to aggregate data from multiple imaging modalities (bright field, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy) and species (mouse, rat, rabbit, human), to create an open-source, durable tool for axon and myelin segmentation. Our generalist model makes it easier for researchers to process their data and can be fine-tuned for better performance on specific domains. We study the benefits of different aggregation schemes. This multi-domain segmentation model performs better than single-modality dedicated learners (p=0.03077), generalizes better on out-of-distribution data and is easier to use and maintain. Importantly, we package the segmentation tool into a well-maintained open-source software ecosystem (see https://github.com/axondeepseg/axondeepseg).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqing Wang, Chang Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head and neck (H&N) cancers is a time-consuming and experience-demanding task where a large number of planning objectives are involved. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been introduced to the planning processes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy for prostate, lung, and cervical cancers. However, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and weighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor scalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of planning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic treatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning of H&N cancers. Specifically, a set of empirical rules is used to create auxiliary planning structures from target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs), along with their associated planning objectives. These planning objectives are fed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU) values. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans. Moreover, additional experiments on liver cancer demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully generalized to other treatment sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRL-based automatic treatment planning model capable of achieving human-level performance for H&N cancers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Homodyned K-distribution (HK-distribution) parameter estimation in quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been recently addressed using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). BNNs have been shown to significantly reduce computational time in speckle statistics-based QUS without compromising accuracy and precision. Additionally, they provide estimates of feature uncertainty, which can guide the clinician's trust in the reported feature value. The total predictive uncertainty in Bayesian modeling can be decomposed into epistemic (uncertainty over the model parameters) and aleatoric (uncertainty inherent in the data) components. By decomposing the predictive uncertainty, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to the total uncertainty. In this study, we propose a method to compute epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for HK-distribution parameters ($\alpha$ and $k$) estimated by a BNN, in both simulation and experimental data. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the prediction error and both uncertainties, shedding light on the interplay between these uncertainties and HK parameters errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyesh Vakharia, Abigail Kufeldt, Max Meyers, Ian Lane, Leilani Gilpin</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurosymbolic approaches can add robustness to opaque neural systems by incorporating explainable symbolic representations. However, previous approaches have not used formal logic to contextualize queries to and validate outputs of large language models (LLMs). We propose \systemname{}, a novel neurosymbolic framework, to improve the robustness and reliability of LLMs in question-answering tasks. We provide \systemname{} with a domain-specific knowledge base, a logical reasoning system, and an integration to an existing LLM. This framework has two capabilities (1) context gathering: generating explainable and relevant context for a given query, and (2) validation: confirming and validating the factual accuracy of a statement in accordance with a knowledge base (KB). Our work opens a new area of neurosymbolic generative AI text validation and user personalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Chen, Dongshu Liu, Jeremie Laydevant, Julie Grollier</p>
<p>Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is a recent, purely forward-mode learning method, that updates weights locally and layer-wise and supports supervised as well as unsupervised learning. These features make it ideal for applications such as brain-inspired learning, low-power hardware neural networks, and distributed learning in large models. However, while FF has shown promise on written digit recognition tasks, its performance on natural images and time-series remains a challenge. A key limitation is the need to generate high-quality negative examples for contrastive learning, especially in unsupervised tasks, where versatile solutions are currently lacking. To address this, we introduce the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) method, inspired by self-supervised contrastive learning. SCFF generates positive and negative examples applicable across different datasets, surpassing existing local forward algorithms for unsupervised classification accuracy on MNIST (MLP: 98.7%), CIFAR-10 (CNN: 80.75%), and STL-10 (CNN: 77.3%). Additionally, SCFF is the first to enable FF training of recurrent neural networks, opening the door to more complex tasks and continuous-time video and text processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> To Eun Kim, Fernando Diaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities, leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking, neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future research. We publicly release our codebase and dataset at https://github.com/kimdanny/Fair-RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Ba\~no-Medina, Agniv Sengupta, Allison Michaelis, Luca Delle Monache, Julie Kalansky, Duncan Watson-Parris</p>
<p>Abstract: AI data-driven models (Graphcast, Pangu Weather, Fourcastnet, and SFNO) are explored for storyline-based climate attribution due to their short inference times, which can accelerate the number of events studied, and provide real time attributions when public attention is heightened. The analysis is framed on the extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the Oroville dam spillway incident in Northern California. Past and future simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the pre-industrial and the late-21st century temperature climate change signals, respectively. The simulations are compared to results from a dynamical model which represents plausible pseudo-realities under both climate environments. Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5-6 % increase in the integrated water vapor over the Oroville dam in the present day compared to the pre-industrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different geopotential-moisture-temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the AI-models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to simulate weaker attribution values than the pseudo-reality imagined by the dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for the late-21st century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model (>500 members) produced statistically significant present-day to pre-industrial attribution results, unlike the >20-member ensemble from the dynamical model. This analysis highlights the potential of AI models to conduct attribution analysis, while emphasizing future lines of work on explainable artificial intelligence to gain confidence in these tools, which can enable reliable attribution studies in real-time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgenia-Maria K. Goula, Dimitris G. Sotiropoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are essential for solving complex optimization problems in different fields. However, the difficulty in comparing and rating these algorithms remains due to the wide range of performance metrics and problem dimensions usually involved. On the other hand, nonparametric statistical methods and post hoc tests are time-consuming, especially when we only need to identify the top performers among many algorithms. The Hierarchical Rank Aggregation (HRA) algorithm aims to efficiently rank metaheuristic algorithms based on their performance across many criteria and dimensions. The HRA employs a hierarchical framework that begins with collecting performance metrics on various benchmark functions and dimensions. Rank-based normalization is employed for each performance measure to ensure comparability and the robust TOPSIS aggregation is applied to combine these rankings at several hierarchical levels, resulting in a comprehensive ranking of the algorithms. Our study uses data from the CEC 2017 competition to demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the HRA framework. It examines 30 benchmark functions and evaluates the performance of 13 metaheuristic algorithms across five performance indicators in four distinct dimensions. This presentation highlights the potential of the HRA to enhance the interpretation of the comparative advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms by simplifying practitioners' choices of the most appropriate algorithm for certain optimization problems.</p>

By analyzing the conversational dynamics between scammers and victims, LLM-based detectors can identify potential scams as they occur, offering immediate protection to users.

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. A. G. Yogi Pramana, Faiz Ihza Permana, Muhammad Fazil Maulana, Dzikri Rahadian Fudholi</p>
<p>Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment effectiveness and reducing transmission risk. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through image classification of chest X-rays, can assist in TB detection. However, class imbalance in TB chest X-ray datasets presents a challenge for accurate classification. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning (FSL) approach using the Prototypical Network algorithm to address this issue. We compare the performance of ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGG16 in feature extraction from the TBX11K Chest X-ray dataset. Experimental results demonstrate classification accuracies of 98.93% for ResNet-18, 98.60% for ResNet-50, and 33.33% for VGG16. These findings indicate that the proposed method outperforms others in mitigating data imbalance, which is particularly beneficial for disease classification applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, challenges, and methodologies associated with quantizing large-scale neural network models. As neural networks have evolved towards larger and more complex architectures to address increasingly sophisticated tasks, the computational and energy costs have escalated significantly. We explore the necessity and impact of model size growth, highlighting the performance benefits as well as the computational challenges and environmental considerations. The core focus is on model quantization as a fundamental approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing model size and improving efficiency without substantially compromising accuracy. We delve into various quantization techniques, including both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT), and analyze several state-of-the-art algorithms such as LLM-QAT, PEQA(L4Q), ZeroQuant, SmoothQuant, and others. Through comparative analysis, we examine how these methods address issues like outliers, importance weighting, and activation quantization, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and accessible deployment of large-scale models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The cell is arguably the smallest unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of AI-powered Virtual Cells, where robust representations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions are directly learned from growing biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using Virtual Instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions is within reach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuiwei Liu, Siang Xu, Huaijun Qiu, Jing Zhang, Zhi Liu, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning is crucial for developing scalable and adaptive intelligent systems, as it enables models to acquire new classes with minimal annotated data while safeguarding the previously accumulated knowledge. Nonetheless, existing methods deal with continuous data streams in a centralized manner, limiting their applicability in scenarios that prioritize data privacy and security. To this end, this paper introduces federated few-shot class-incremental learning, a decentralized machine learning paradigm tailored to progressively learn new classes from scarce data distributed across multiple clients. In this learning paradigm, clients locally update their models with new classes while preserving data privacy, and then transmit the model updates to a central server where they are aggregated globally. However, this paradigm faces several issues, such as difficulties in few-shot learning, catastrophic forgetting, and data heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we present a synthetic data-driven framework that leverages replay buffer data to maintain existing knowledge and facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge. Within this framework, a noise-aware generative replay module is developed to fine-tune local models with a balance of new and replay data, while generating synthetic data of new classes to further expand the replay buffer for future tasks. Furthermore, a class-specific weighted aggregation strategy is designed to tackle data heterogeneity by adaptively aggregating class-specific parameters based on local models performance on synthetic data. This enables effective global model optimization without direct access to client data. Comprehensive experiments across three widely-used datasets underscore the effectiveness and preeminence of the introduced framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodi Wang, Tangyu Jiang, Yu Guo, Xiaohua Jia, Chengjun Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have been extensively adopted in various regions due to their ability to represent hierarchical features, which highly rely on the training set and procedures. Thus, protecting the training process and deep learning algorithms is paramount in privacy preservation. Although Differential Privacy (DP) as a powerful cryptographic primitive has achieved satisfying results in deep learning training, the existing schemes still fall short in preserving model utility, i.e., they either invoke a high noise scale or inevitably harm the original gradients. To address the above issues, in this paper, we present a more robust approach for DP training called GReDP. Specifically, we compute the model gradients in the frequency domain and adopt a new approach to reduce the noise level. Unlike the previous work, our GReDP only requires half of the noise scale compared to DPSGD [1] while keeping all the gradient information intact. We present a detailed analysis of our method both theoretically and empirically. The experimental results show that our GReDP works consistently better than the baselines on all models and training settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Histopathology analysis is the gold standard for medical diagnosis. Accurate classification of whole slide images (WSIs) and region-of-interests (ROIs) localization can assist pathologists in diagnosis. The gigapixel resolution of WSI and the absence of fine-grained annotations make direct classification and analysis challenging. In weakly supervised learning, multiple instance learning (MIL) presents a promising approach for WSI classification. The prevailing strategy is to use attention mechanisms to measure instance importance for classification. However, attention mechanisms fail to capture inter-instance information, and self-attention causes quadratic computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose AMD-MIL, an agent aggregator with a mask denoise mechanism. The agent token acts as an intermediate variable between the query and key for computing instance importance. Mask and denoising matrices, mapped from agents-aggregated value, dynamically mask low-contribution representations and eliminate noise. AMD-MIL achieves better attention allocation by adjusting feature representations, capturing micro-metastases in cancer, and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, CAMELYON-17, TCGA-KIDNEY, and TCGA-LUNG show AMD-MIL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The intricate nature of real-world driving environments, characterized by dynamic and diverse interactions among multiple vehicles and their possible future states, presents considerable challenges in accurately predicting the motion states of vehicles and handling the uncertainty inherent in the predictions. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive modeling and reasoning to capture the implicit relations among vehicles and the corresponding diverse behaviors. This research introduces an integrated framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) motion prediction to address these complexities, utilizing a novel Relational Hypergraph Interaction-informed Neural mOtion generator (RHINO). RHINO leverages hypergraph-based relational reasoning by integrating a multi-scale hypergraph neural network to model group-wise interactions among multiple vehicles and their multi-modal driving behaviors, thereby enhancing motion prediction accuracy and reliability. Experimental validation using real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of this framework in improving predictive accuracy and fostering socially aware automated driving in dynamic traffic scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pose skeleton images are an important reference in pose-controllable image generation. In order to enrich the source of skeleton images, recent works have investigated the generation of pose skeletons based on natural language. These methods are based on GANs. However, it remains challenging to perform diverse, structurally correct and aesthetically pleasing human pose skeleton generation with various textual inputs. To address this problem, we propose a framework with GUNet as the main model, PoseDiffusion. It is the first generative framework based on a diffusion model and also contains a series of variants fine-tuned based on a stable diffusion model. PoseDiffusion demonstrates several desired properties that outperform existing methods. 1) Correct Skeletons. GUNet, a denoising model of PoseDiffusion, is designed to incorporate graphical convolutional neural networks. It is able to learn the spatial relationships of the human skeleton by introducing skeletal information during the training process. 2) Diversity. We decouple the key points of the skeleton and characterise them separately, and use cross-attention to introduce textual conditions. Experimental results show that PoseDiffusion outperforms existing SoTA algorithms in terms of stability and diversity of text-driven pose skeleton generation. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate its superiority for controllable generation in Stable Diffusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning integrates human expertise to accelerate agent learning and provide critical guidance and feedback in complex fields. However, many existing approaches focus on single-agent tasks and require continuous human involvement during the training process, significantly increasing the human workload and limiting scalability. In this paper, we propose HARP (Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic), a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed for group-oriented tasks. HARP integrates automatic agent regrouping with strategic human assistance during deployment, enabling and allowing non-experts to offer effective guidance with minimal intervention. During training, agents dynamically adjust their groupings to optimize collaborative task completion. When deployed, they actively seek human assistance and utilize the Permutation Invariant Group Critic to evaluate and refine human-proposed groupings, allowing non-expert users to contribute valuable suggestions. In multiple collaboration scenarios, our approach is able to leverage limited guidance from non-experts and enhance performance. The project can be found at https://github.com/huawen-hu/HARP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) significantly affects the social and communication abilities of children, and eye-tracking is commonly used as a diagnostic tool by identifying associated atypical gaze patterns. Traditional methods demand manual identification of Areas of Interest in gaze patterns, lowering the performance of gaze behavior analysis in ASD subjects. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method to automatically analyze gaze behaviors in ASD children with superior accuracy. To be specific, we first apply and optimize seven clustering algorithms to automatically group gaze points to compare ASD subjects with typically developing peers. Subsequently, we extract 63 significant features to fully describe the patterns. These features can describe correlations between ASD diagnosis and gaze patterns. Lastly, using these features as prior knowledge, we train multiple predictive machine learning models to predict and diagnose ASD based on their gaze behaviors. To evaluate our method, we apply our method to three ASD datasets. The experimental and visualization results demonstrate the improvements of clustering algorithms in the analysis of unique gaze patterns in ASD children. Additionally, these predictive machine learning models achieved state-of-the-art prediction performance ($81\%$ AUC) in the field of automatically constructed gaze point features for ASD diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyi Hu, Qiao Han, Kui Chen, Yao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: To mitigate the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial attacks, adversarial training has emerged as a prevalent and effective defense strategy. Intrinsically, this countermeasure incurs a trade-off, as it sacrifices the model's accuracy in processing normal samples. To reconcile the trade-off, we pioneer the incorporation of null-space projection into adversarial training and propose two innovative Null-space Projection based Adversarial Training(NPAT) algorithms tackling sample generation and gradient optimization, named Null-space Projected Data Augmentation (NPDA) and Null-space Projected Gradient Descent (NPGD), to search for an overarching optimal solutions, which enhance robustness with almost zero deterioration in generalization performance. Adversarial samples and perturbations are constrained within the null-space of the decision boundary utilizing a closed-form null-space projector, effectively mitigating threat of attack stemming from unreliable features. Subsequently, we conducted experiments on the CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets and reveal that our methodology can seamlessly combine with adversarial training methods and obtain comparable robustness while keeping generalization close to a high-accuracy model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Finn Lukas Busch, Timon Homberger, Jes\'us Ortega-Peimbert, Quantao Yang, Olov Andersson</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability to efficiently search for objects in complex environments is fundamental for many real-world robot applications. Recent advances in open-vocabulary vision models have resulted in semantically-informed object navigation methods that allow a robot to search for an arbitrary object without prior training. However, these zero-shot methods have so far treated the environment as unknown for each consecutive query. In this paper we introduce a new benchmark for zero-shot multi-object navigation, allowing the robot to leverage information gathered from previous searches to more efficiently find new objects. To address this problem we build a reusable open-vocabulary feature map tailored for real-time object search. We further propose a probabilistic-semantic map update that mitigates common sources of errors in semantic feature extraction and leverage this semantic uncertainty for informed multi-object exploration. We evaluate our method on a set of object navigation tasks in both simulation as well as with a real robot, running in real-time on a Jetson Orin AGX. We demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both on single and multi-object navigation tasks. Additional videos, code and the multi-object navigation benchmark will be available on https://finnbsch.github.io/OneMap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Wang, Yaxiong Wang, Guoshuai Zhao, Xueming Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally recognize new classes using a few samples while maintaining the performance on previously learned classes. One of the effective methods to solve this challenge is to construct prototypical evolution classifiers. Despite the advancement achieved by most existing methods, the classifier weights are simply initialized using mean features. Because representations for new classes are weak and biased, we argue such a strategy is suboptimal. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two aspects. Firstly, thanks to the development of foundation models, we employ a foundation model, the CLIP, as the network pedestal to provide a general representation for each class. Secondly, to generate a more reliable and comprehensive instance representation, we propose a Knowledge Adapter (KA) module that summarizes the data-specific knowledge from training data and fuses it into the general representation. Additionally, to tune the knowledge learned from the base classes to the upcoming classes, we propose a mechanism of Incremental Pseudo Episode Learning (IPEL) by simulating the actual FSCIL. Taken together, our proposed method, dubbed as Knowledge Adaptation Network (KANet), achieves competitive performance on a wide range of datasets, including CIFAR100, CUB200, and ImageNet-R.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faiza Bouamra, Mohamed Sayah, Labib Sadek Terrissa, Noureddine Zerhouni</p>
<p>Abstract: In material physics, characterization techniques are foremost crucial for obtaining the materials data regarding the physical properties as well as structural, electronics, magnetic, optic, dielectric, and spectroscopic characteristics. However, for many materials, ensuring availability and safe accessibility is not always easy and fully warranted. Moreover, the use of modeling and simulation techniques need a lot of theoretical knowledge, in addition of being associated to costly computation time and a great complexity deal. Thus, analyzing materials with different techniques for multiple samples simultaneously, still be very challenging for engineers and researchers. It is worth noting that although of being very risky, X-ray diffraction is the well known and widely used characterization technique which gathers data from structural properties of crystalline 1d, 2d or 3d materials. We propose in this paper, a Smart GRU for Gated Recurrent Unit model to forcast structural characteristics or properties of thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110). Indeed, thin films samples are elaborated and managed experimentally and the collected data dictionary is then used to generate an AI -- Artificial Intelligence -- GRU model for the thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110) structural property characterization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiming Ge, Zhao Luo, Chunhui Zhang, Yingying Hua, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep trackers have proven success in visual tracking. Typically, these trackers employ optimally pre-trained deep networks to represent all diverse objects with multi-channel features from some fixed layers. The deep networks employed are usually trained to extract rich knowledge from massive data used in object classification and so they are capable to represent generic objects very well. However, these networks are too complex to represent a specific moving object, leading to poor generalization as well as high computational and memory costs. This paper presents a novel and general framework termed channel distillation to facilitate deep trackers. To validate the effectiveness of channel distillation, we take discriminative correlation filter (DCF) and ECO for example. We demonstrate that an integrated formulation can turn feature compression, response map generation, and model update into a unified energy minimization problem to adaptively select informative feature channels that improve the efficacy of tracking moving objects on the fly. Channel distillation can accurately extract good channels, alleviating the influence of noisy channels and generally reducing the number of channels, as well as adaptively generalizing to different channels and networks. The resulting deep tracker is accurate, fast, and has low memory requirements. Extensive experimental evaluations on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiming Ge, Shengwei Zhao, Chenyu Li, Yu Zhang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition in the wild is now advancing towards light-weight models, fast inference speed and resolution-adapted capability. In this paper, we propose a bridge distillation approach to turn a complex face model pretrained on private high-resolution faces into a light-weight one for low-resolution face recognition. In our approach, such a cross-dataset resolution-adapted knowledge transfer problem is solved via two-step distillation. In the first step, we conduct cross-dataset distillation to transfer the prior knowledge from private high-resolution faces to public high-resolution faces and generate compact and discriminative features. In the second step, the resolution-adapted distillation is conducted to further transfer the prior knowledge to synthetic low-resolution faces via multi-task learning. By learning low-resolution face representations and mimicking the adapted high-resolution knowledge, a light-weight student model can be constructed with high efficiency and promising accuracy in recognizing low-resolution faces. Experimental results show that the student model performs impressively in recognizing low-resolution faces with only 0.21M parameters and 0.057MB memory. Meanwhile, its speed reaches up to 14,705, ~934 and 763 faces per second on GPU, CPU and mobile phone, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajaa El Hamdani, Thomas Bonald, Fragkiskos Malliaros, Nils Holzenberger, Fabian Suchanek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the factuality of large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases in the legal domain, in a realistic usage scenario: we allow for acceptable variations in the answer, and let the model abstain from answering when uncertain. First, we design a dataset of diverse factual questions about case law and legislation. We then use the dataset to evaluate several LLMs under different evaluation methods, including exact, alias, and fuzzy matching. Our results show that the performance improves significantly under the alias and fuzzy matching methods. Further, we explore the impact of abstaining and in-context examples, finding that both strategies enhance precision. Finally, we demonstrate that additional pre-training on legal documents, as seen with SaulLM, further improves factual precision from 63% to 81%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Wahab, Tariq Mahmood Khan, Shahzaib Iqbal, Bandar AlShammari, Bandar Alhaqbani, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: Identification of suspects based on partial and smudged fingerprints, commonly referred to as fingermarks or latent fingerprints, presents a significant challenge in the field of fingerprint recognition. Although fixed-length embeddings have shown effectiveness in recognising rolled and slap fingerprints, the methods for matching latent fingerprints have primarily centred around local minutiae-based embeddings, failing to fully exploit global representations for matching purposes. Consequently, enhancing latent fingerprints becomes critical to ensuring robust identification for forensic investigations. Current approaches often prioritise restoring ridge patterns, overlooking the fine-macroeconomic details crucial for accurate fingerprint recognition. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses generative adversary networks (GANs) to redefine Latent Fingerprint Enhancement (LFE) through a structured approach to fingerprint generation. By directly optimising the minutiae information during the generation process, the model produces enhanced latent fingerprints that exhibit exceptional fidelity to ground-truth instances. This leads to a significant improvement in identification performance. Our framework integrates minutiae locations and orientation fields, ensuring the preservation of both local and structural fingerprint features. Extensive evaluations conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate our method's dominance over existing state-of-the-art techniques, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance latent fingerprint recognition accuracy in forensic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Tian, Hao Chen, Yongjian Deng, Feihong Shen, Kepan Liu, Wei You, Ziyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojie Li, Zhaoshuo Diao</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent development of deep learning large models in medicine shows remarkable performance in medical image analysis and diagnosis, but their large number of parameters causes memory and inference latency challenges. Knowledge distillation offers a solution, but the slide-level gradients cannot be backpropagated for student model updates due to high-resolution pathological images and slide-level labels. This study presents an Efficient Fine-tuning on Compressed Models (EFCM) framework with two stages: unsupervised feature distillation and fine-tuning. In the distillation stage, Feature Projection Distillation (FPD) is proposed with a TransScan module for adaptive receptive field adjustment to enhance the knowledge absorption capability of the student model. In the slide-level fine-tuning stage, three strategies (Reuse CLAM, Retrain CLAM, and End2end Train CLAM (ETC)) are compared. Experiments are conducted on 11 downstream datasets related to three large medical models: RETFound for retina, MRM for chest X-ray, and BROW for histopathology. The experimental results demonstrate that the EFCM framework significantly improves accuracy and efficiency in handling slide-level pathological image problems, effectively addressing the challenges of deploying large medical models. Specifically, it achieves a 4.33% increase in ACC and a 5.2% increase in AUC compared to the large model BROW on the TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-BRCA datasets. The analysis of model inference efficiency highlights the high efficiency of the distillation fine-tuning method.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, speech diffusion models have advanced rapidly. Alongside the widely used U-Net architecture, transformer-based models such as the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) have also gained attention. However, current DiT speech models treat Mel spectrograms as general images, which overlooks the specific acoustic properties of speech. To address these limitations, we propose a method called Directional Patch Interaction for Text-to-Speech (DPI-TTS), which builds on DiT and achieves fast training without compromising accuracy. Notably, DPI-TTS employs a low-to-high frequency, frame-by-frame progressive inference approach that aligns more closely with acoustic properties, enhancing the naturalness of the generated speech. Additionally, we introduce a fine-grained style temporal modeling method that further improves speaker style similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method increases the training speed by nearly 2 times and significantly outperforms the baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Gu, Kexin Huang, Ruilin Luo, Yuanqi Yao, Yujiu Yang, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize sensitive information, raising concerns about potential misuse. LLM Unlearning, a post-hoc approach to remove this information from trained LLMs, offers a promising solution to mitigate these risks. However, previous practices face three key challenges: 1. Utility: successful unlearning often causes catastrophic collapse on unrelated tasks. 2. Efficiency: many methods either involve adding similarly sized models, which slows down unlearning or inference, or require retain data that are difficult to obtain. 3. Robustness: even effective methods may still leak data via extraction techniques. To address these challenges, we propose MEOW, a simple yet effective gradient descent-based unlearning method. Specifically, we use an offline LLM to generate a set of inverted facts. Then, we design a new metric, MEMO, to quantify memorization in LLMs. Finally, based on the signals provided by MEMO, we select the most appropriate set of inverted facts and finetune the model based on them. We evaluate MEOW on the commonly used unlearn benchmark, ToFU, with Llama2-7B-Chat and Phi-1.5B, and test it on both NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvement of MEOW in forget quality without substantial loss in model utility. Meanwhile, MEOW does not exhibit significant degradation in NLU or NLG capabilities, and there is even a slight improvement in NLU performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in task planning for long-horizon manipulation tasks. To enhance the validity of LLM-generated plans, visual demonstrations and online videos have been widely employed to guide the planning process. However, for manipulation tasks involving subtle movements but rich contact interactions, visual perception alone may be insufficient for the LLM to fully interpret the demonstration. Additionally, visual data provides limited information on force-related parameters and conditions, which are crucial for effective execution on real robots.
  In this paper, we introduce an in-context learning framework that incorporates tactile and force-torque information from human demonstrations to enhance LLMs' ability to generate plans for new task scenarios. We propose a bootstrapped reasoning pipeline that sequentially integrates each modality into a comprehensive task plan. This task plan is then used as a reference for planning in new task configurations. Real-world experiments on two different sequential manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving LLMs' understanding of multi-modal demonstrations and enhancing the overall planning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Zhaxizhuoma, Pengan Chen, Ziniu Wu, Jiawei Sun, Dong Wang, Peng Zhou, Nieqing Cao, Yan Ding, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents AlignBot, a novel framework designed to optimize VLM-powered customized task planning for household robots by effectively aligning with user reminders. In domestic settings, aligning task planning with user reminders poses significant challenges due to the limited quantity, diversity, and multimodal nature of the reminders. To address these challenges, AlignBot employs a fine-tuned LLaVA-7B model, functioning as an adapter for GPT-4o. This adapter model internalizes diverse forms of user reminders-such as personalized preferences, corrective guidance, and contextual assistance-into structured instruction-formatted cues that prompt GPT-4o in generating customized task plans. Additionally, AlignBot integrates a dynamic retrieval mechanism that selects task-relevant historical successes as prompts for GPT-4o, further enhancing task planning accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of AlignBot, experiments are conducted in real-world household environments, which are constructed within the laboratory to replicate typical household settings. A multimodal dataset with over 1,500 entries derived from volunteer reminders is used for training and evaluation. The results demonstrate that AlignBot significantly improves customized task planning, outperforming existing LLM- and VLM-powered planners by interpreting and aligning with user reminders, achieving 86.8% success rate compared to the vanilla GPT-4o baseline at 21.6%, reflecting a 65% improvement and over four times greater effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Cremades, Sergio Hoyas, Ricardo Vinuesa</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of data-driven methods in fluid mechanics has surged dramatically in recent years due to their capacity to adapt to the complex and multi-scale nature of turbulent flows, as well as to detect patterns in large-scale simulations or experimental tests. In order to interpret the relationships generated in the models during the training process, numerical attributions need to be assigned to the input features. One important example are the additive-feature-attribution methods. These explainability methods link the input features with the model prediction, providing an interpretation based on a linear formulation of the models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP values) are formulated as the only possible interpretation that offers a unique solution for understanding the model. In this manuscript, the additive-feature-attribution methods are presented, showing four common implementations in the literature: kernel SHAP, tree SHAP, gradient SHAP, and deep SHAP. Then, the main applications of the additive-feature-attribution methods are introduced, dividing them into three main groups: turbulence modeling, fluid-mechanics fundamentals, and applied problems in fluid dynamics and heat transfer. This review shows thatexplainability techniques, and in particular additive-feature-attribution methods, are crucial for implementing interpretable and physics-compliant deep-learning models in the fluid-mechanics field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claude Formanek, Louise Beyers, Callum Rhys Tilbury, Jonathan P. Shock, Arnu Pretorius</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an exciting direction of research that uses static datasets to find optimal control policies for multi-agent systems. Though the field is by definition data-driven, efforts have thus far neglected data in their drive to achieve state-of-the-art results. We first substantiate this claim by surveying the literature, showing how the majority of works generate their own datasets without consistent methodology and provide sparse information about the characteristics of these datasets. We then show why neglecting the nature of the data is problematic, through salient examples of how tightly algorithmic performance is coupled to the dataset used, necessitating a common foundation for experiments in the field. In response, we take a big step towards improving data usage and data awareness in offline MARL, with three key contributions: (1) a clear guideline for generating novel datasets; (2) a standardisation of over 80 existing datasets, hosted in a publicly available repository, using a consistent storage format and easy-to-use API; and (3) a suite of analysis tools that allow us to understand these datasets better, aiding further development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Ferraro, Pietro Mazzaglia, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt, Sai Rajeswar</p>
<p>Abstract: Object manipulation capabilities are essential skills that set apart embodied agents engaging with the world, especially in the realm of robotics. The ability to predict outcomes of interactions with objects is paramount in this setting. While model-based control methods have started to be employed for tackling manipulation tasks, they have faced challenges in accurately manipulating objects. As we analyze the causes of this limitation, we identify the cause of underperformance in the way current world models represent crucial positional information, especially about the target's goal specification for object positioning tasks. We introduce a general approach that empowers world model-based agents to effectively solve object-positioning tasks. We propose two declinations of this approach for generative world models: position-conditioned (PCP) and latent-conditioned (LCP) policy learning. In particular, LCP employs object-centric latent representations that explicitly capture object positional information for goal specification. This naturally leads to the emergence of multimodal capabilities, enabling the specification of goals through spatial coordinates or a visual goal. Our methods are rigorously evaluated across several manipulation environments, showing favorable performance compared to current model-based control approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Chen, Lingxiao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, training models with datasets from various locations and organizations presents significant challenges due to privacy and legal concerns. The exploration of effective collaborative training settings capable of leveraging valuable knowledge from distributed and isolated datasets is increasingly crucial. This study investigates key factors that impact the effectiveness of collaborative training methods in code next-token prediction, as well as the correctness and utility of the generated code, demonstrating the promise of such methods. Additionally, we evaluate the memorization of different participant training data across various collaborative training settings, including centralized, federated, and incremental training, highlighting their potential risks in leaking data. Our findings indicate that the size and diversity of code datasets are pivotal factors influencing the success of collaboratively trained code models. We show that federated learning achieves competitive performance compared to centralized training while offering better data protection, as evidenced by lower memorization ratios in the generated code. However, federated learning can still produce verbatim code snippets from hidden training data, potentially violating privacy or copyright. Our study further explores effectiveness and memorization patterns in incremental learning, emphasizing the sequence in which individual participant datasets are introduced. We also identify cross-organizational clones as a prevalent challenge in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the persistent risk of data leakage during inference, even when training data remains unseen. We conclude with recommendations for practitioners and researchers to optimize multisource datasets, propelling cross-organizational collaboration forward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Montagna, Simone Scardapane, Lev Telyatnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks based on the message-passing (MP) mechanism are a dominant approach for handling graph-structured data. However, they are inherently limited to modeling only pairwise interactions, making it difficult to explicitly capture the complexity of systems with $n$-body relations. To address this, topological deep learning has emerged as a promising field for studying and modeling higher-order interactions using various topological domains, such as simplicial and cellular complexes. While these new domains provide powerful representations, they introduce new challenges, such as effectively modeling the interactions among higher-order structures through higher-order MP. Meanwhile, structured state-space sequence models have proven to be effective for sequence modeling and have recently been adapted for graph data by encoding the neighborhood of a node as a sequence, thereby avoiding the MP mechanism. In this work, we propose a novel architecture designed to operate with simplicial complexes, utilizing the Mamba state-space model as its backbone. Our approach generates sequences for the nodes based on the neighboring cells, enabling direct communication between all higher-order structures, regardless of their rank. We extensively validate our model, demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models developed for simplicial complexes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Melacci, Alessandro Betti, Michele Casoni, Tommaso Guidi, Matteo Tiezzi, Marco Gori</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes Hamiltonian Learning, a novel unified framework for learning with neural networks "over time", i.e., from a possibly infinite stream of data, in an online manner, without having access to future information. Existing works focus on the simplified setting in which the stream has a known finite length or is segmented into smaller sequences, leveraging well-established learning strategies from statistical machine learning. In this paper, the problem of learning over time is rethought from scratch, leveraging tools from optimal control theory, which yield a unifying view of the temporal dynamics of neural computations and learning. Hamiltonian Learning is based on differential equations that: (i) can be integrated without the need of external software solvers; (ii) generalize the well-established notion of gradient-based learning in feed-forward and recurrent networks; (iii) open to novel perspectives. The proposed framework is showcased by experimentally proving how it can recover gradient-based learning, comparing it to out-of-the box optimizers, and describing how it is flexible enough to switch from fully-local to partially/non-local computational schemes, possibly distributed over multiple devices, and BackPropagation without storing activations. Hamiltonian Learning is easy to implement and can help researches approach in a principled and innovative manner the problem of learning over time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this, we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that paraphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms. Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks, particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model. However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data, combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10-year dataset provided by a major health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model, particularly with a 24-month observation window, exhibits superior performance in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and predicting ESRD progression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline. Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity, and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety. Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply the benefits of data-driven insights.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models: Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model, it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct. (3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling, optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math competition problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong</p>
<p>Abstract: In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations, making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document. Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2 scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuqi Wang, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, abbreviated as linear TD, is a classic and powerful prediction algorithm in reinforcement learning. While it is well understood that linear TD converges almost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires the assumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent. However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practical scenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence of linear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do not make any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated value function converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set. We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates. Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions and do not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm. Key to our analysis is a novel characterization of bounded invariant sets of the mean ODE of linear TD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN (GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping. Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2 16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters, outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy, achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.</p>

In this report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production, generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models. For detailed demos, please refer to https://takinaudiollm.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their "black box" and static nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank, and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The present State-of-the-Art (SotA) Image Super-Resolution (ISR) methods employ Deep Learning (DL) techniques using a large amount of image data. The primary limitation to extending the existing SotA ISR works for real-world instances is their computational and time complexities. In this paper, contrary to the existing methods, we present a novel and computationally efficient ISR algorithm that is independent of the image dataset to learn the ISR task. The proposed algorithm reformulates the ISR task from generating the Super-Resolved (SR) images to computing the inverse of the kernels that span the degradation space. We introduce Deep Identity Learning, exploiting the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The proposed approach neither relies on the ISR dataset nor on a single input low-resolution (LR) image (like the self-supervised method i.e. ZSSR) to model the ISR task. Hence we term our model as Null-Shot Super-Resolution Using Deep Identity Learning (NSSR-DIL). The proposed NSSR-DIL model requires fewer computational resources, at least by an order of 10, and demonstrates a competitive performance on benchmark ISR datasets. Another salient aspect of our proposition is that the NSSR-DIL framework detours retraining the model and remains the same for varying scale factors like X2, X3, and X4. This makes our highly efficient ISR model more suitable for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lara Gauder, Pablo Riera, Andrea Slachevsky, Gonzalo Forno, Adolfo M. Garcia, Luciana Ferrer</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated speech analysis is a thriving approach to detect early markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, recording conditions in most AD datasets are heterogeneous, with patients and controls often evaluated in different acoustic settings. While this is not a problem for analyses based on speech transcription or features obtained from manual alignment, it does cast serious doubts on the validity of acoustic features, which are strongly influenced by acquisition conditions. We examined this issue in the ADreSSo dataset, derived from the widely used Pitt corpus. We show that systems based on two acoustic features, MFCCs and Wav2vec 2.0 embeddings, can discriminate AD patients from controls with above-chance performance when using only the non-speech part of the audio signals. We replicated this finding in a separate dataset of Spanish speakers. Thus, in these datasets, the class can be partly predicted by recording conditions. Our results are a warning against the use of acoustic systems for identifying patients based on non-standardized recordings. We propose that acoustically heterogeneous datasets for dementia studies should be either (a) analyzed using only transcripts or other features derived from manual annotations, or (b) replaced by datasets collected with strictly controlled acoustic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Van Woensel, Oshani Seneviratne</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Health 3.0 allows decision making to be based on longitudinal data from multiple institutions, from across the patient's healthcare journey. In such a distributed setting, blockchain smart contracts can act as neutral intermediaries to implement trustworthy decision making.
  Objective: In a distributed setting, transmitted data will be structured using standards (such as HL7 FHIR) for semantic interoperability. In turn, the smart contract will require interoperability with this standard, implement a complex communication setup (e.g., using oracles), and be developed using blockchain languages (e.g., Solidity). We propose the encoding of smart contract logic using a high-level semantic Knowledge Graph, using concepts from the domain standard. We then deploy this semantic KG on blockchain.
  Methods: Off-chain, a code generation pipeline compiles the KG into a concrete smart contract, which is then deployed on-chain. Our pipeline targets an intermediary bridge representation, which can be transpiled into a specific blockchain language. Our choice avoids on-chain rule engines, with unpredictable and likely higher computational cost; it is thus in line with the economic rules of blockchain.
  Results: We applied our code generation approach to generate smart contracts for 3 health insurance cases from Medicare. We discuss the suitability of our approach - the need for a neutral intermediary - for a number of healthcare use cases. Our evaluation finds that the generated contracts perform well in terms of correctness and execution cost ("gas") on blockchain.
  Conclusions: We showed that it is feasible to automatically generate smart contract code based on a semantic KG, in a way that respects the economic rules of blockchain. Future work includes studying the use of Large Language Models (LLM) in our approach, and evaluations on other blockchains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna-Maria Halacheva, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by enabling exceptional modeling of long-range dependencies and capturing intricate linguistic patterns. However, their inherent reliance on linear operations in the form of matrix multiplications limits their ability to fully capture inter-token relationships on their own. We propose M\"obiusAttention, a novel approach that integrates M\"obius transformations within the attention mechanism of Transformer-based models. M\"obius transformations are non-linear operations in spaces over complex numbers with the ability to map between various geometries. By incorporating these properties, M\"obiusAttention empowers models to learn more intricate geometric relationships between tokens and capture a wider range of information through complex-valued weight vectors. We build and pre-train a BERT and a RoFormer version enhanced with M\"obiusAttention, which we then finetune on the GLUE benchmark. We evaluate empirically our approach against the baseline BERT and RoFormer models on a range of downstream tasks. Our approach compares favorably against the baseline models, even with smaller number of parameters suggesting the enhanced expressivity of M\"obiusAttention. This research paves the way for exploring the potential of M\"obius transformations in the complex projective space to enhance the expressivity and performance of foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and 'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems) cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt. More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and 'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aya El Mir, Lukelo Thadei Luoga, Boyuan Chen, Muhammad Abdullah Hanif, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in healthcare is hindered by their high computational demands and significant memory requirements, which are particularly challenging for resource-constrained devices like the Nvidia Jetson Xavier. This problem is particularly evident in remote medical settings where advanced diagnostics are needed but resources are limited. In this paper, we introduce an optimization method for the general-purpose MLLM, TinyLLaVA, which we have adapted and renamed TinyLLaVA-Med. This adaptation involves instruction-tuning and fine-tuning TinyLLaVA on a medical dataset by drawing inspiration from the LLaVA-Med training pipeline. Our approach successfully minimizes computational complexity and power consumption, with TinyLLaVA-Med operating at 18.9W and using 11.9GB of memory, while achieving accuracies of 64.54% on VQA-RAD and 70.70% on SLAKE for closed-ended questions. Therefore, TinyLLaVA-Med achieves deployment viability in hardware-constrained environments with low computational resources, maintaining essential functionalities and delivering accuracies close to state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-ssl.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: We embark on the age-old quest: unveiling the hidden dimensions of objects from mere glimpses of their visible parts. To address this, we present Vista3D, a framework that realizes swift and consistent 3D generation within a mere 5 minutes. At the heart of Vista3D lies a two-phase approach: the coarse phase and the fine phase. In the coarse phase, we rapidly generate initial geometry with Gaussian Splatting from a single image. In the fine phase, we extract a Signed Distance Function (SDF) directly from learned Gaussian Splatting, optimizing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. Furthermore, it elevates the quality of generation by using a disentangled representation with two independent implicit functions to capture both visible and obscured aspects of objects. Additionally, it harmonizes gradients from 2D diffusion prior with 3D-aware diffusion priors by angular diffusion prior composition. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that Vista3D effectively sustains a balance between the consistency and diversity of the generated 3D objects. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/florinshen/Vista3D.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing several areas of Artificial Intelligence. One of the most remarkable applications is creative writing, e.g., poetry or storytelling: the generated outputs are often of astonishing quality. However, a natural question arises: can LLMs be really considered creative? In this article, we first analyze the development of LLMs under the lens of creativity theories, investigating the key open questions and challenges. In particular, we focus our discussion on the dimensions of value, novelty, and surprise as proposed by Margaret Boden in her work. Then, we consider different classic perspectives, namely product, process, press, and person. We discuss a set of ``easy'' and ``hard'' problems in machine creativity, presenting them in relation to LLMs. Finally, we examine the societal impact of these technologies with a particular focus on the creative industries, analyzing the opportunities offered, the challenges arising from them, and the potential associated risks, from both legal and ethical points of view.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'ement Lalanne (ENS de Lyon, OCKHAM), Aur\'elien Garivier (UMPA-ENSL, MC2), R\'emi Gribonval (OCKHAM)</p>
<p>Abstract: We study non-parametric density estimation for densities in Lipschitz and Sobolev spaces, and under central privacy. In particular, we investigate regimes where the privacy budget is not supposed to be constant. We consider the classical definition of central differential privacy, but also the more recent notion of central concentrated differential privacy. We recover the result of Barber and Duchi (2014) stating that histogram estimators are optimal against Lipschitz distributions for the L2 risk, and under regular differential privacy, and we extend it to other norms and notions of privacy. Then, we investigate higher degrees of smoothness, drawing two conclusions: First, and contrary to what happens with constant privacy budget (Wasserman and Zhou, 2010), there are regimes where imposing privacy degrades the regular minimax risk of estimation on Sobolev densities. Second, so-called projection estimators are near-optimal against the same classes of densities in this new setup with pure differential privacy, but contrary to the constant privacy budget case, it comes at the cost of relaxation. With zero concentrated differential privacy, there is no need for relaxation, and we prove that the estimation is optimal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan-Ni Wu, Tong Wang, Li-Juan Tang, Hai-Long Wu, Ru-Qin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoding is the carrier of information. Artificial intelligence models possess basic capabilities in syntax, semantics, and reasoning, but these capabilities are sensitive to specific inputs. This study introduces TSIS (Simplified TSID) to the t-SMILES family, with the intention of conducting a more comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of t-SMILES. TSID has been demonstrated significantly outperforms classical SMILES, DeepSMILES, and SELFIES in previous research. Further analysis of this study reveals that the tree structure utilized by the t-SMILES framework is more effectively comprehensible than initially anticipated. Additionally, TSIS, along with their variants, demonstrate comparable performance to TSID and markedly surpass that of SMILES, SAFE, and SELFIES. Moreover, its format is more straightforward to read. Overall, the contrast analysis indicates that the hierarchical structure of t-SMILES enhances its generalizability. Concurrently, the evaluation of the generative models reveals that the GPT model exhibits the highest novelty-similarity scores. The VAE and diffusion models demonstrate robust capabilities in terms of interpolation, whereas the LSTM model encounters some challenges in parsing complex structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the development of various AI systems to support learning in various domains, AI assistance for art appreciation education has not been extensively explored. Art appreciation, often perceived as an unfamiliar and challenging endeavor for most students, can be more accessible with a generative AI enabled conversation partner that provides tailored questions and encourages the audience to deeply appreciate artwork. This study explores the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in art appreciation education, with a focus on developing LLaVA-Docent, a model designed to serve as a personal tutor for art appreciation. Our approach involved design and development research, focusing on iterative enhancement to design and develop the application to produce a functional MLLM-enabled chatbot along with a data design framework for art appreciation education. To that end, we established a virtual dialogue dataset that was generated by GPT-4, which was instrumental in training our MLLM, LLaVA-Docent. The performance of LLaVA-Docent was evaluated by benchmarking it against alternative settings and revealed its distinct strengths and weaknesses. Our findings highlight the efficacy of the MMLM-based personalized art appreciation chatbot and demonstrate its applicability for a novel approach in which art appreciation is taught and experienced.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly changing environments of disaster response, planning and decision-making for autonomous agents involve complex and interdependent choices. Although recent advancements have improved traditional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, they often struggle in such settings, particularly when applied to agents operating outside their well-defined training parameters. To address these challenges, we propose an attention-based cognitive architecture inspired by Dual Process Theory (DPT). This framework integrates, in an online fashion, rapid yet heuristic (human-like) responses (System 1) with the slow but optimized planning capabilities of machine intelligence (System 2). We illustrate how a supervisory controller can dynamically determine in real-time the engagement of either system to optimize mission objectives by assessing their performance across a number of distinct attributes. Evaluated for trajectory planning in dynamic environments, our framework demonstrates that this synergistic integration effectively manages complex tasks by optimizing multiple mission objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Yuan, Zixiang Di, Zhiqing Cui, Guisong Yang, Usman Naseem</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid zero-sum game problem, where the goal is to find a set in the state space, referred to as the reach-avoid set, such that the system starting at a state therein could be controlled to reach a given target set without violating constraints under the worst-case disturbance. We address this problem by designing a new value function with a contracting Bellman backup, where the super-zero level set, i.e., the set of states where the value function is evaluated to be non-negative, recovers the reach-avoid set. Building upon this, we prove that the proposed method can be adapted to compute the viability kernel, or the set of states which could be controlled to satisfy given constraints, and the backward reachable set, or the set of states that could be driven towards a given target set. Finally, we propose to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue in high-dimensional problems by extending Conservative Q-Learning, a deep reinforcement learning technique, to learn a value function such that the super-zero level set of the learned value function serves as a (conservative) approximation to the reach-avoid set. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the proposed method could learn reliably the reach-avoid set and the optimal control policy even with neural network approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faeze Brahman, Chandra Bhagavatula, Valentina Pyatkin, Jena D. Hwang, Xiang Lorraine Li, Hirona J. Arai, Soumya Sanyal, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Xiang Ren, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedural planning, which entails decomposing a high-level goal into a sequence of temporally ordered steps, is an important yet intricate task for machines. It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason about complex and often contextualized situations, e.g. ``scheduling a doctor's appointment without a phone''. While current approaches show encouraging results using large language models (LLMs), they are hindered by drawbacks such as costly API calls and reproducibility issues. In this paper, we advocate planning using smaller language models. We present PlaSma, a novel two-pronged approach to endow small language models with procedural knowledge and (constrained) language planning capabilities. More concretely, we develop symbolic procedural knowledge distillation to enhance the commonsense knowledge in small language models and an inference-time algorithm to facilitate more structured and accurate reasoning. In addition, we introduce a new related task, Replanning, that requires a revision of a plan to cope with a constrained situation. In both the planning and replanning settings, we show that orders-of-magnitude smaller models (770M-11B parameters) can compete and often surpass their larger teacher models' capabilities. Finally, we showcase successful application of PlaSma in an embodied environment, VirtualHome.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrik Joslin Kenfack, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Ulrich A\"ivodji</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing works on fairness assume the model has full access to demographic information. However, there exist scenarios where demographic information is partially available because a record was not maintained throughout data collection or for privacy reasons. This setting is known as demographic scarce regime. Prior research has shown that training an attribute classifier to replace the missing sensitive attributes (proxy) can still improve fairness. However, using proxy-sensitive attributes worsens fairness-accuracy tradeoffs compared to true sensitive attributes. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to build attribute classifiers that achieve better fairness-accuracy tradeoffs. Our method introduces uncertainty awareness in the attribute classifier and enforces fairness on samples with demographic information inferred with the lowest uncertainty. We show empirically that enforcing fairness constraints on samples with uncertain sensitive attributes can negatively impact the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. Our experiments on five datasets showed that the proposed framework yields models with significantly better fairness-accuracy tradeoffs than classic attribute classifiers. Surprisingly, our framework can outperform models trained with fairness constraints on the true sensitive attributes in most benchmarks. We also show that these findings are consistent with other uncertainty measures such as conformal prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blair Attard-Frost, David Gray Widder</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with an interest in AI ethics need more integrative approaches for studying and intervening in AI systems across many contexts and scales of activity. This paper presents AI value chains as an integrative concept that satisfies that need. To more clearly theorize AI value chains and conceptually distinguish them from supply chains, we review theories of value chains and AI value chains from the strategic management, service science, economic geography, industry, government, and applied research literature. We then conduct an integrative review of a sample of 67 sources that cover the ethical concerns implicated in AI value chains. Building upon the findings of our integrative review, we recommend three future directions that researchers, practitioners, and policymakers can take to advance more ethical practices across AI value chains. We urge AI ethics researchers and practitioners to move toward value chain perspectives that situate actors in context, account for the many types of resources involved in co-creating AI systems, and integrate a wider range of ethical concerns across contexts and scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Scassola, Sebastiano Saccani, Ginevra Carbone, Luca Bortolussi</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as effective approaches for both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when a classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose a method that, given a pre-trained unconditional score-based generative model, samples from the conditional distribution under arbitrary logical constraints, without requiring additional training. Differently from other zero-shot techniques, that rather aim at generating valid conditional samples, our method is designed for approximating the true conditional distribution. Firstly, we show how to manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach in approximating conditional distributions for various types of constraints and data: tabular data, images and time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Roth, Thomas Liebig</p>
<p>Abstract: Our study reveals new theoretical insights into over-smoothing and feature over-correlation in graph neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that with increased depth, node representations become dominated by a low-dimensional subspace that depends on the aggregation function but not on the feature transformations. For all aggregation functions, the rank of the node representations collapses, resulting in over-smoothing for particular aggregation functions. Our study emphasizes the importance for future research to focus on rank collapse rather than over-smoothing. Guided by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property that provably prevents over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse. We empirically demonstrate the shortcomings of existing models in fitting target functions of node classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengmao Ye, Dengchun Li, Zetao Hu, Tingfeng Lan, Jian Sha, Sicong Zhang, Lei Duan, Jie Zuo, Hui Lu, Yuanchun Zhou, Mingjie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse domains, particularly in the emerging {\em pretrain-then-finetune} paradigm. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is commonly used to adapt a base LLM to multiple downstream tasks. Further, LLM platforms enable developers to fine-tune multiple models and develop various domain-specific applications simultaneously. However, existing model parallelism schemes suffer from high communication overhead and inefficient GPU utilization when training multiple LoRA tasks across GPUs and machines.
  In this paper, we present mLoRA, a parallelism-efficient fine-tuning system designed for training multiple LoRA across GPUs and machines. mLoRA introduces a novel LoRA-aware pipeline parallelism scheme that efficiently pipelines independent LoRA adapters and their distinct fine-tuning stages across GPUs and machines, along with a new LoRA-efficient operator to enhance GPU utilization during pipelined LoRA training. Our extensive evaluation shows that mLoRA can significantly reduce average fine-tuning task completion time, e.g., by 30\%, compared to state-of-the-art methods like FSDP. More importantly, mLoRA enables simultaneous fine-tuning of larger models, e.g., two Llama-2-13B models on four NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB GPUs, which is not feasible for FSDP due to high memory requirements. Hence, mLoRA not only increases fine-tuning efficiency but also makes it more accessible on cost-effective GPUs. mLoRA has been deployed in AntGroup's production environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoforos Galazis, Samuel Shepperd, Emma Brouwer, Sandro Queir\'os, Ebraham Alskaf, Mustafa Anjari, Amedeo Chiribiri, Jack Lee, Anil A. Bharath, Marta Varela</p>
<p>Abstract: The functional analysis of the left atrium (LA) is important for evaluating cardiac health and understanding diseases like atrial fibrillation. Cine MRI is ideally placed for the detailed 3D characterization of LA motion and deformation but is lacking appropriate acquisition and analysis tools. Here, we propose tools for the Analysis for Left Atrial Displacements and DeformatIons using online learning neural Networks (Aladdin) and present a technical feasibility study on how Aladdin can characterize 3D LA function globally and regionally. Aladdin includes an online segmentation and image registration network, and a strain calculation pipeline tailored to the LA. We create maps of LA Displacement Vector Field (DVF) magnitude and LA principal strain values from images of 10 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), of which 2 had large left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) impairment. We additionally create an atlas of these biomarkers using the data from the healthy volunteers. Results showed that Aladdin can accurately track the LA wall across the cardiac cycle and characterize its motion and deformation. Global LA function markers assessed with Aladdin agree well with estimates from 2D Cine MRI. A more marked active contraction phase was observed in the healthy cohort, while the CVD LVEF group showed overall reduced LA function. Aladdin is uniquely able to identify LA regions with abnormal deformation metrics that may indicate focal pathology. We expect Aladdin to have important clinical applications as it can non-invasively characterize atrial pathophysiology.

<p>Abstract: This research study explores the conceptualization, development, and deployment of an innovative learning analytics tool, leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 model to quantify student engagement, map learning progression, and evaluate diverse instructional strategies within an educational context. By analyzing critical data points such as students' stress levels, curiosity, confusion, agitation, topic preferences, and study methods, the tool provides a comprehensive view of the learning environment. It also employs Bloom's taxonomy to assess cognitive development based on student inquiries. In addition to technical evaluation through synthetic data, feedback from a survey of teaching faculty at the University of Iowa was collected to gauge perceived benefits and challenges. Faculty recognized the tool's potential to enhance instructional decision-making through real-time insights but expressed concerns about data security and the accuracy of AI-generated insights. The study outlines the design, implementation, and evaluation of the tool, highlighting its contributions to educational outcomes, practical integration within learning management systems, and future refinements needed to address privacy and accuracy concerns. This research underscores AI's role in shaping personalized, data-driven education.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causal Structure Learning (CSL), also referred to as causal discovery, amounts to extracting causal relations among variables in data. CSL enables the estimation of causal effects from observational data alone, avoiding the need to perform real life experiments. Constraint-based CSL leverages conditional independence tests to perform causal discovery. We propose Shapley-PC, a novel method to improve constraint-based CSL algorithms by using Shapley values over the possible conditioning sets, to decide which variables are responsible for the observed conditional (in)dependences. We prove soundness, completeness and asymptotic consistency of Shapley-PC and run a simulation study showing that our proposed algorithm is superior to existing versions of PC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), which highlights the existence of efficient subnetworks within larger, dense networks, a high-performing Winning Subnetwork (WSN) in terms of task performance under appropriate sparsity conditions is considered for various continual learning tasks. It leverages pre-existing weights from dense networks to achieve efficient learning in Task Incremental Learning (TIL) and Task-agnostic Incremental Learning (TaIL) scenarios. In Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), a variation of WSN referred to as the Soft subnetwork (SoftNet) is designed to prevent overfitting when the data samples are scarce. Furthermore, the sparse reuse of WSN weights is considered for Video Incremental Learning (VIL). The use of Fourier Subneural Operator (FSO) within WSN is considered. It enables compact encoding of videos and identifies reusable subnetworks across varying bandwidths. We have integrated FSO into different architectural frameworks for continual learning, including VIL, TIL, and FSCIL. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate FSO's effectiveness, significantly improving task performance at various convolutional representational levels. Specifically, FSO enhances higher-layer performance in TIL and FSCIL and lower-layer performance in VIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqi Su, Jay Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), recent years have witnessed a significant surge in the application of machine learning (ML). Despite this growth, the field grapples with a lack of unified guidelines and systematic approaches for effectively implementing these ML techniques and comprehensive analysis regarding industrial open-source data across varied scenarios. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of ML approaches for diagnostics and prognostics of industrial systems using open-source datasets from PHM Data Challenge Competitions held between 2018 and 2023 by PHM Society and IEEE Reliability Society and summarizes a unified ML framework. This review systematically categorizes and scrutinizes the problems, challenges, methodologies, and advancements demonstrated in these competitions, highlighting the evolving role of both conventional machine learning and deep learning in tackling complex industrial tasks related to detection, diagnosis, assessment, and prognosis. Moreover, this paper delves into the common challenges in PHM data challenge competitions by emphasizing data-related and model-related issues and evaluating the limitations of these competitions. The potential solutions to address these challenges are also summarized. Finally, we identify key themes and potential directions for future research, providing opportunities and prospects for next-generation ML-PHM development in PHM domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: As deep learning (DL) models are widely and effectively used in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, there is a rapidly growing interest in DL watermarking techniques that can be used to confirm the ownership of a particular model. Unfortunately, these methods usually produce watermarks susceptible to model stealing attacks. In our research, we introduce a novel trigger set-based watermarking approach that demonstrates resilience against functionality stealing attacks, particularly those involving extraction and distillation. Our approach does not require additional model training and can be applied to any model architecture. The key idea of our method is to compute the trigger set, which is transferable between the source model and the set of proxy models with a high probability. In our experimental study, we show that if the probability of the set being transferable is reasonably high, it can be effectively used for ownership verification of the stolen model. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art watermarking techniques in all considered experimental setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Pugnana, Lorenzo Perini, Jesse Davis, Salvatore Ruggieri</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in many socially sensitive tasks, there is a growing demand for reliable and trustworthy predictions. One way to accomplish these requirements is to allow a model to abstain from making a prediction when there is a high risk of making an error. This requires adding a selection mechanism to the model, which selects those examples for which the model will provide a prediction. The selective classification framework aims to design a mechanism that balances the fraction of rejected predictions (i.e., the proportion of examples for which the model does not make a prediction) versus the improvement in predictive performance on the selected predictions. Multiple selective classification frameworks exist, most of which rely on deep neural network architectures. However, the empirical evaluation of the existing approaches is still limited to partial comparisons among methods and settings, providing practitioners with little insight into their relative merits. We fill this gap by benchmarking 18 baselines on a diverse set of 44 datasets that includes both image and tabular data. Moreover, there is a mix of binary and multiclass tasks. We evaluate these approaches using several criteria, including selective error rate, empirical coverage, distribution of rejected instance's classes, and performance on out-of-distribution instances. The results indicate that there is not a single clear winner among the surveyed baselines, and the best method depends on the users' objectives.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15284">Beyond principlism: Practical strategies for ethical AI use in research practices</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines, leading to a Triple-Too problem: too many high-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and practical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits and utilities. Existing approaches, including principlism (reliance on abstract ethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technical solutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes), offer little practical guidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research practices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day research practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed here. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding model training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy violations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using AI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionable strategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue that ethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing alternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I propose documentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research. Moving forward, we need targeted professional development, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical guidelines and adapting them to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate scientific progress without compromising research integrity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hackathons have emerged as pivotal platforms in the software industry, driving both innovation and skill development for organizations and students alike. These events enable companies to quickly prototype new ideas while offering students practical, hands-on learning experiences. Over time, hackathons have transitioned from purely competitive events to valuable educational tools, integrating theory with real-world problem-solving through collaboration between academia and industry. The infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is now reshaping hackathons, providing enhanced learning opportunities while also introducing ethical challenges. This study explores the influence of generative AI on students' technological choices, focusing on a case study from the 2023 University of Iowa Hackathon. The findings offer insights into AI's role in these events, its educational impact, and propose strategies for integrating such technologies in future hackathons, ensuring a balance between innovation, ethics, and educational value.</p>

In most cases, the accuracy of our method is in fact similar to that of the reference methods, even though the main objective of our study is the immediate interpretability of our classifiers. We also prove a new result on the probability that the classifier we obtain from real-life data corresponds to the ideally best classifier with respect to the background distribution the data comes from.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanpeng Chu, Wei Wu, Chengjie Zang, Kun Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, setting new benchmarks in quality and creativity. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the intensive computation required during the iterative denoising process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a solution to accelerate sampling, aibeit at the expense of sample quality, extremely in low-bit settings. Addressing this, our study introduces a unified Quantization Noise Correction Scheme (QNCD), aimed at minishing quantization noise throughout the sampling process. We identify two primary quantization challenges: intra and inter quantization noise. Intra quantization noise, mainly exacerbated by embeddings in the resblock module, extends activation quantization ranges, increasing disturbances in each single denosing step. Besides, inter quantization noise stems from cumulative quantization deviations across the entire denoising process, altering data distributions step-by-step. QNCD combats these through embedding-derived feature smoothing for eliminating intra quantization noise and an effective runtime noise estimatiation module for dynamicly filtering inter quantization noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous quantization methods for diffusion models, achieving lossless results in W4A8 and W8A8 quantization settings on ImageNet (LDM-4).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiqiang Wu, Chaofan Tao, Jiahao Wang, Runming Yang, Zhe Zhao, Ngai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Kullback-Leiber divergence has been widely used in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). Contrary to prior assertions that reverse Kullback-Leibler (RKL) divergence is mode-seeking and thus preferable over the mean-seeking forward Kullback-Leibler (FKL) divergence, this study empirically and theoretically demonstrates that neither mode-seeking nor mean-seeking properties manifest in KD for LLMs. Instead, RKL and FKL are found to share the same optimization objective and both converge after a sufficient number of epochs. However, due to practical constraints, LLMs are seldom trained for such an extensive number of epochs. Meanwhile, we further find that RKL focuses on the tail part of the distributions, while FKL focuses on the head part at the beginning epochs. Consequently, we propose a simple yet effective Adaptive Kullback-Leiber (AKL) divergence method, which adaptively allocates weights to combine FKL and RKL. Metric-based and GPT-4-based evaluations demonstrate that the proposed AKL outperforms the baselines across various tasks and improves the diversity and quality of generated responses.</p>

However, each of these tasks typically focuses on single modality generation or rendering, leaving yet-to-be-bridged gaps between the approaches correspondingly designed for each of the tasks. In this paper, we combine text rendering and layout-to-image generation tasks into a single task: layout-controllable text-object synthesis (LTOS) task, aiming at synthesizing images with object and visual text based on predefined object layout and text contents. As compliant datasets are not readily available for our LTOS task, we construct a layout-aware text-object synthesis dataset, containing elaborate well-aligned labels of visual text and object information. Based on the dataset, we propose a layout-controllable text-object adaptive fusion (TOF) framework, which generates images with clear, legible visual text and plausible objects. We construct a visual-text rendering module to synthesize text and employ an object-layout control module to generate objects while integrating the two modules to harmoniously generate and integrate text content and objects in images. To better the image-text integration, we propose a self-adaptive cross-attention fusion module that helps the image generation to attend more to important text information. Within such a fusion module, we use a self-adaptive learnable factor to learn to flexibly control the influence of cross-attention outputs on image generation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in LTOS, text rendering, and layout-to-image tasks, enabling harmonious visual text rendering and object generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhoujie Ding, Ken Ziyu Liu, Pura Peetathawatchai, Berivan Isik, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation of large models, particularly LoRA, has gained traction due to its computational efficiency. This efficiency, contrasted with the prohibitive costs of full-model fine-tuning, means that practitioners often turn to LoRA and sometimes without a complete understanding of its ramifications. In this study, we focus on fairness and ask whether LoRA has an unexamined impact on utility, calibration, and resistance to membership inference across different subgroups (e.g., genders, races, religions) compared to a full-model fine-tuning baseline. We present extensive experiments across vision and language domains and across classification and generation tasks using ViT-Base, Swin-v2-Large, Llama-2 7B, and Mistral 7B. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that while one can isolate cases where LoRA exacerbates model bias across subgroups, the pattern is inconsistent -- in many cases, LoRA has equivalent or even improved fairness compared to the base model or its full fine-tuning baseline. We also examine the complications of evaluating fine-tuning fairness relating to task design and model token bias, calling for more careful fairness evaluations in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjun Luo, Ziye Deng, Ruizhe Chen, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development and reduced barriers to entry for Text-to-Image (T2I) models have raised concerns about the biases in their outputs, but existing research lacks a holistic definition and evaluation framework of biases, limiting the enhancement of debiasing techniques. To address this issue, we introduce FAIntbench, a holistic and precise benchmark for biases in T2I models. In contrast to existing benchmarks that evaluate bias in limited aspects, FAIntbench evaluate biases from four dimensions: manifestation of bias, visibility of bias, acquired attributes, and protected attributes. We applied FAIntbench to evaluate seven recent large-scale T2I models and conducted human evaluation, whose results demonstrated the effectiveness of FAIntbench in identifying various biases. Our study also revealed new research questions about biases, including the side-effect of distillation. The findings presented here are preliminary, highlighting the potential of FAIntbench to advance future research aimed at mitigating the biases in T2I models. Our benchmark is publicly available to ensure the reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Weltevrede, Felix Kaubek, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Wendelin B\"ohmer</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the remaining challenges in reinforcement learning is to develop agents that can generalise to novel scenarios they might encounter once deployed. This challenge is often framed in a multi-task setting where agents train on a fixed set of tasks and have to generalise to new tasks. Recent work has shown that in this setting increased exploration during training can be leveraged to increase the generalisation performance of the agent. This makes sense when the states encountered during testing can actually be explored during training. In this paper, we provide intuition why exploration can also benefit generalisation to states that cannot be explicitly encountered during training. Additionally, we propose a novel method Explore-Go that exploits this intuition by increasing the number of states on which the agent trains. Explore-Go effectively increases the starting state distribution of the agent and as a result can be used in conjunction with most existing on-policy or off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. We show empirically that our method can increase generalisation performance in an illustrative environment and on the Procgen benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialang Xu, Nazir Sirajudeen, Matthew Boal, Nader Francis, Danail Stoyanov, Evangelos Mazomenos</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated detection of surgical errors can improve robotic-assisted surgery. Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with a bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying duration. Our work also contributes the first-of-its-kind, frame-level, in-vivo surgical error dataset to support error detection in real surgical cases. Specifically, we deploy the clinically validated observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors during suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50). Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gains with significantly reduced computational complexity. The corresponding error annotations, code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/SEDMamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgio Franceschelli, Claudia Cevenini, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: The training process of foundation models as for other classes of deep learning systems is based on minimizing the reconstruction error over a training set. For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Bianco, David Eigen, Michael Gormish</p>
<p>Abstract: We examine the challenge of estimating the location of a single ground-level image in the absence of GPS or other location metadata. Currently, geolocation systems are evaluated by measuring the Great Circle Distance between the predicted location and ground truth. Because this measurement only uses a single point, it cannot assess the distribution of predictions by geolocation systems. Evaluation of a distribution of potential locations (areas) is required when there are follow-on procedures to further narrow down or verify the location. This is especially important in poorly-sampled regions e.g. rural and wilderness areas.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, Recall vs Area (RvA), which measures the accuracy of estimated distributions of locations. RvA treats image geolocation results similarly to document retrieval, measuring recall as a function of area: For a ranked list of (possibly discontiguous) predicted regions, we measure the area required for accumulated regions to contain the ground truth coordinate. This produces a curve similar to a precision-recall curve, where "precision" is replaced by square kilometers area, enabling evaluation for different downstream search area budgets.
  Following from this view of the problem, we then examine an ensembling approach to global-scale image geolocation, which incorporates information from multiple sources, and can readily incorporate multiple models, attribute predictors, and data sources. We study its effectiveness by combining the geolocation models GeoEstimation and the current state-of-the-art, GeoCLIP, with attribute predictors based on Oak Ridge National Laboratory LandScan and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover. We find significant improvements in image geolocation for areas that are under-represented in the training set, particularly non-urban areas, on both Im2GPS3k and Street View images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiqun Wang, Yiping Bao, Panwang Pan, Zeming Li, Xiao Liu, Ruijie Yang, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal pre-training for 3D point clouds have demonstrated promising results by aligning heterogeneous features across 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D images and language descriptions. However, current straightforward solutions often overlook intricate structural relations among samples, potentially limiting the full capabilities of multi-modal learning. To address this issue, we introduce Multi-modal Relation Distillation (MRD), a tri-modal pre-training framework, which is designed to effectively distill reputable large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into 3D backbones. MRD aims to capture both intra-relations within each modality as well as cross-relations between different modalities and produce more discriminative 3D shape representations. Notably, MRD achieves significant improvements in downstream zero-shot classification tasks and cross-modality retrieval tasks, delivering new state-of-the-art performance.</p>

Therefore, multimodal fake news detection has recently garnered increased attention. However, the existing datasets are comprised of user-uploaded videos and contain an excess amounts of superfluous data, which introduces noise into the model training process.

The crawl officially published videos are augmented through the use of LLMs-based generation and manual verification, thereby expanding the dataset. Furthermore, the proposed dataset is benchmarked against several baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal news detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vipin Singh, Tianheng Ling, Teodor Chiaburu, Felix Biessmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in static protein structure collection and prediction, the dynamic behavior of proteins, one of their most vital characteristics, has been largely overlooked in prior research. This oversight can be attributed to the limited availability, diversity, and heterogeneity of dynamic protein datasets. To address this gap, we propose to enhance existing prestigious static 3D protein structural databases, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), by integrating dynamic data and additional physical properties. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale dataset, Dynamic PDB, encompassing approximately 12.6K proteins, each subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lasting 1 microsecond to capture conformational changes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive suite of physical properties, including atomic velocities and forces, potential and kinetic energies of proteins, and the temperature of the simulation environment, recorded at 1 picosecond intervals throughout the simulations. For benchmarking purposes, we evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset for the task of trajectory prediction. To demonstrate the value of integrating richer physical properties in the study of protein dynamics and related model design, we base our approach on the SE(3) diffusion model and incorporate these physical properties into the trajectory prediction process. Preliminary results indicate that this straightforward extension of the SE(3) model yields improved accuracy, as measured by MAE and RMSD, when the proposed physical properties are taken into consideration. https://fudan-generative-vision.github.io/dynamicPDB/ .</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have completely transformed the domain of computational pathology (CPath). More specifically, it has altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. The limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath can be overcome by FMs through learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. Deploying VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language be used as rich semantic information sources to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and its possible revolution through the use of FMs and VLMs in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Past ontology requirements engineering (ORE) has primarily relied on manual methods, such as interviews and collaborative forums, to gather user requirements from domain experts, especially in large projects. Current OntoChat offers a framework for ORE that utilises large language models (LLMs) to streamline the process through four key functions: user story creation, competency question (CQ) extraction, CQ filtration and analysis, and ontology testing support. In OntoChat, users are expected to prompt the chatbot to generate user stories. However, preliminary evaluations revealed that they struggle to do this effectively. To address this issue, we experimented with a research method called participatory prompting, which involves researcher-mediated interactions to help users without deep knowledge of LLMs use the chatbot more effectively. This participatory prompting user study produces pre-defined prompt templates based on user queries, focusing on creating and refining personas, goals, scenarios, sample data, and data resources for user stories. These refined user stories will subsequently be converted into CQs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Wang, Wing-Yin Yu, Ruifeng She, Wenhan Yang, Taijie Chen, Jianping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) has been extensively applied in areas requiring mathematical solvers to address complex instances within tight time constraints. However, as the problem scale increases, the complexity of model formulation and finding feasible solutions escalates significantly. In contrast, the model-building cost for end-to-end models, such as large language models (LLMs), remains largely unaffected by problem scale due to their pattern recognition capabilities. While LLMs, like GPT-4, without fine-tuning, can handle some traditional medium-scale MIP problems, they struggle with uncommon or highly specialized MIP scenarios. Fine-tuning LLMs can yield some feasible solutions for medium-scale MIP instances, but these models typically fail to explore diverse solutions when constrained by a low and constant temperature, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a recursively dynamic temperature method integrated with a chain-of-thought approach. Our findings show that starting with a high temperature and gradually lowering it leads to better feasible solutions compared to other dynamic temperature strategies. Additionally, by comparing results generated by the LLM with those from Gurobi, we demonstrate that the LLM can produce solutions that complement traditional solvers by accelerating the pruning process and improving overall efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of LLMs has greatly enhanced the intelligence and fluency of question answering, while the emergence of retrieval enhancement has enabled models to better utilize external information. However, the presence of noise and errors in retrieved information poses challenges to the robustness of LLMs. In this work, to evaluate the model's performance under multiple interferences, we first construct a dataset based on machine reading comprehension datasets simulating various scenarios, including critical information absence, noise, and conflicts. To address the issue of model accuracy decline caused by noisy external information, we propose a data augmentation-based fine-tuning method to enhance LLM's robustness against noise. Additionally, contrastive learning approach is utilized to preserve the model's discrimination capability of external information. We have conducted experiments on both existing LLMs and our approach, the results are evaluated by GPT-4, which indicates that our proposed methods improve model robustness while strengthening the model's discrimination capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, translating these demonstrations into robot-executable actions presents significant challenges due to execution mismatches in movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods either depend on robot-demonstrator paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or rely too heavily on frame-level visual similarities that often break down in practice. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically aligns robot and demonstrator task executions using optimal transport costs. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent demonstrator videos by retrieving and composing short-horizon demonstrator clips. This approach facilitates effective policy training without the need for paired data. We demonstrate that RHyME outperforms a range of baselines across cross-embodiment datasets, showing a 52% increase in task recall over prior cross-embodiment learning methods.

<p>Abstract: While tactile sensing is widely accepted as an important and useful sensing modality, its use pales in comparison to other sensory modalities like vision and proprioception. AnySkin addresses the critical challenges that impede the use of tactile sensing -- versatility, replaceability, and data reusability. Building on the simplistic design of ReSkin, and decoupling the sensing electronics from the sensing interface, AnySkin simplifies integration making it as straightforward as putting on a phone case and connecting a charger. Furthermore, AnySkin is the first uncalibrated tactile-sensor with cross-instance generalizability of learned manipulation policies. To summarize, this work makes three key contributions: first, we introduce a streamlined fabrication process and a design tool for creating an adhesive-free, durable and easily replaceable magnetic tactile sensor; second, we characterize slip detection and policy learning with the AnySkin sensor; and third, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization of models trained on one instance of AnySkin to new instances, and compare it with popular existing tactile solutions like DIGIT and ReSkin.https://any-skin.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Zhang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture excels in a variety of language modeling tasks, outperforming traditional neural architectures such as RNN and LSTM. This is partially due to its elimination of recurrent connections, which allows for parallel training and a smoother flow of gradients. However, this move away from recurrent structures places the Transformer model at the lower end of Chomsky's computational hierarchy, imposing limitations on its computational abilities. Consequently, even advanced Transformer-based models face considerable difficulties in tasks like counting, string reversal, and multiplication. These tasks, though seemingly elementary, require a level of computational complexity that exceeds the capabilities of the Transformer architecture. Concurrently, the emergence of ``Chain of Thought" (CoT) prompting has enabled Transformer-based language models to tackle tasks that were previously impossible or poorly executed. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the influence of recurrent structures in neural models on their reasoning abilities and computability, contrasting the role autoregression plays in the neural models' computational power. We then shed light on how the CoT approach can mimic recurrent computation and act as a bridge between autoregression and recurrence in the context of language models. It is this approximated recurrence that notably improves the model's performance and computational capacity. Moreover, we revisit recent recurrent-based Transformer model designs, focusing on their computational abilities through our proposed concept of ``recurrence-completeness" and identify key theoretical limitations in models like Linear Transformer and RWKV. Through this, we aim to provide insight into the neural model architectures and prompt better model design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Suri, Praneet Dutta, Flora Xue, Ines Azevedo, Ravi Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered by renewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential for managing grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks poses a major threat to the Internet, highlighting the importance of DDoS mitigation. Most existing approaches require complex training methods to learn data features, which increases the complexity and generality of the application. In this paper, we propose DrLLM, which aims to mine anomalous traffic information in zero-shot scenarios through Large Language Models (LLMs). To bridge the gap between DrLLM and existing approaches, we embed the global and local information of the traffic data into the reasoning paradigm and design three modules, namely Knowledge Embedding, Token Embedding, and Progressive Role Reasoning, for data representation and reasoning. In addition we explore the generalization of prompt engineering in the cybersecurity domain to improve the classification capability of DrLLM. Our ablation experiments demonstrate the applicability of DrLLM in zero-shot scenarios and further demonstrate the potential of LLMs in the network domains. DrLLM implementation code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/liuup/DrLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Glazkova, Dmitry Morozov</p>
<p>Abstract: Keyphrase selection plays a pivotal role within the domain of scholarly texts, facilitating efficient information retrieval, summarization, and indexing. In this work, we explored how to apply fine-tuned generative transformer-based models to the specific task of keyphrase selection within Russian scientific texts. We experimented with four distinct generative models, such as ruT5, ruGPT, mT5, and mBART, and evaluated their performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. The experiments were conducted on the texts of Russian scientific abstracts from four domains: mathematics & computer science, history, medicine, and linguistics. The use of generative models, namely mBART, led to gains in in-domain performance (up to 4.9% in BERTScore, 9.0% in ROUGE-1, and 12.2% in F1-score) over three keyphrase extraction baselines for the Russian language. Although the results for cross-domain usage were significantly lower, they still demonstrated the capability to surpass baseline performances in several cases, underscoring the promising potential for further exploration and refinement in this research field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairi Furui, Masahito Ohue</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently explore mutants. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants, our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody development.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11022">GEIC: Universal and Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjun Luo, Yingbin Jin, Xuecheng Liu, Tong Shang, Ruizhe Chen, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerous natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11272">LOLA -- An Open-Source Massively Multilingual Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikit Srivastava, Denis Kuchelev, Tatiana Moteu, Kshitij Shetty, Michael R\"oder, Diego Moussallem, Hamada Zahera, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality. Our analysis of the evaluation results shows competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Fang, Zhen Huang, Zhiliang Tian, Minghui Fang, Ziyi Pan, Quntian Fang, Zhihua Wen, Hengyue Pan, Dongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns knowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge triples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we construct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.</p>
