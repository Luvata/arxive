<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Song, Chenhan Lyu, Pengfei Zhang, Sabine Brunswicker, Nikil Dutt, Amir Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Mild-stage dementia patients primarily experience two critical symptoms: severe memory loss and emotional instability. To address these challenges, we propose DEMENTIA-PLAN, an innovative retrieval-augmented generation framework that leverages large language models to enhance conversational support. Our model employs a multiple knowledge graph architecture, integrating various dimensional knowledge representations including daily routine graphs and life memory graphs. Through this multi-graph architecture, DEMENTIA-PLAN comprehensively addresses both immediate care needs and facilitates deeper emotional resonance through personal memories, helping stabilize patient mood while providing reliable memory support. Our notable innovation is the self-reflection planning agent, which systematically coordinates knowledge retrieval and semantic integration across multiple knowledge graphs, while scoring retrieved content from daily routine and life memory graphs to dynamically adjust their retrieval weights for optimized response generation. DEMENTIA-PLAN represents a significant advancement in the clinical application of large language models for dementia care, bridging the gap between AI tools and caregivers interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunnan Wu, Paul Chen, Deshank Baranwal, Jinlong Zhou, Jian Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an agentic framework, Thinker, which achieves state of art performance in challenging reasoning tasks for realistic customer service scenarios that involve complex business logic and human interactions via long horizons. On the $\tau$-bench retail dataset, Thinker achieves 82.6\% success rate with GPT-4o (version 2024-06-01) (baseline: 68.3\%), and 81.9\% success rate with Llama-3.1 405B (baseline: 49.6\%), without any fine-tuning. Thinker effectively closes the gap in reasoning capabilities between the base models by introducing proper structure.
  The key features of the Thinker framework are: (1) State-Machine Augmented Generation (SMAG), which represents business logic as state machines and the LLM uses state machines as tools. (2) Delegation of tasks from the main reasoning loop to LLM-powered tools. (3) Adaptive context management.
  Our prompting-only solution achieves signficant gains, while still maintaining a standard agentic architecture with a ReAct style reasoning loop. The key is to innovate on the tool interface design, as exemplified by SMAG and the LLM-powered tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hedong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluation is critical to advance decision making across domains, yet existing methodologies often struggle to balance theoretical rigor and practical scalability. In order to reduce the cost of experimental evaluation, we introduce a computational theory of evaluation for parameterisable subjects. We prove upper bounds of generalized evaluation error and generalized causal effect error of evaluation metric on subject. We also prove efficiency, and consistency to estimated causal effect of subject on metric by prediction. To optimize evaluation models, we propose a meta-learner to handle heterogeneous evaluation subjects space. Comparing with other computational approaches, our (conditional) evaluation model reduced 24.1%-99.0% evaluation errors across 12 scenes, including individual medicine, scientific simulation, business activities, and quantum trade. The evaluation time is reduced 3-7 order of magnitude comparing with experiments or simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadikshya Gyawali, Ashwini Mandal, Manish Dahal, Manish Awale, Sanjay Rijal, Shital Adhikari, Vaghawan Ojha</p>
<p>Abstract: Chemical reaction network is an important method for modeling and exploring complex biological processes, bio-chemical interactions and the behavior of different dynamics in system biology. But, formulating such reaction kinetics takes considerable time. In this paper, we leverage the efficiency of modern large language models to automate the stochastic monte carlo simulation of chemical reaction networks and enable the simulation through the reaction description provided in the form of natural languages. We also integrate this process into widely used simulation tool Copasi to further give the edge and ease to the modelers and researchers. In this work, we show the efficacy and limitations of the modern large language models to parse and create reaction kinetics for modelling complex chemical reaction processes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232">Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Bheemaiah, Seungyong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21272">Reinforced Model Merging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Han, Jingwen Ye, Shunyu Liu, Haofei Zhang, Jie Song, Zunlei Feng, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large language models has garnered widespread attention for model merging techniques, especially training-free methods which combine model capabilities within the parameter space. However, two challenges remain: (1) uniform treatment of all parameters leads to performance degradation; (2) search-based algorithms are often inefficient. In this paper, we present an innovative framework termed Reinforced Model Merging (RMM), which encompasses an environment and agent tailored for merging tasks. These components interact to execute layer-wise merging actions, aiming to search the optimal merging architecture. Notably, RMM operates without any gradient computations on the original models, rendering it feasible for edge devices. Furthermore, by utilizing data subsets during the evaluation process, we addressed the bottleneck in the reward feedback phase, thereby accelerating RMM by up to 100 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various vision and NLP datasets and effectively overcomes the limitations of the existing baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Luo, Haihong E, Guanting Chen, Yandan Zheng, Xiaobao Wu, Yikai Guo, Qika Lin, Yu Feng, Zemin Kuang, Meina Song, Yifan Zhu, Luu Anh Tuan</p>
<p>Abstract: While standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on chunks, GraphRAG structures knowledge as graphs to leverage the relations among entities. However, previous GraphRAG methods are limited by binary relations: one edge in the graph only connects two entities, which cannot well model the n-ary relations among more than two entities that widely exist in reality. To address this limitation, we propose HyperGraphRAG, a novel hypergraph-based RAG method that represents n-ary relational facts via hyperedges, modeling the complicated n-ary relations in the real world. To retrieve and generate over hypergraphs, we introduce a complete pipeline with a hypergraph construction method, a hypergraph retrieval strategy, and a hypergraph-guided generation mechanism. Experiments across medicine, agriculture, computer science, and law demonstrate that HyperGraphRAG outperforms standard RAG and GraphRAG in accuracy and generation quality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21352">Using large language models to produce literature reviews: Usages and systematic biases of microphysics parametrizations in 2699 publications</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhang Zhang, Shengnan Fu, David M. Schultz, Zhonghua Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models afford opportunities for using computers for intensive tasks, realizing research opportunities that have not been considered before. One such opportunity could be a systematic interrogation of the scientific literature. Here, we show how a large language model can be used to construct a literature review of 2699 publications associated with microphysics parametrizations in the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model, with the goal of learning how they were used and their systematic biases, when simulating precipitation. The database was constructed of publications identified from Web of Science and Scopus searches. The large language model GPT-4 Turbo was used to extract information about model configurations and performance from the text of 2699 publications. Our results reveal the landscape of how nine of the most popular microphysics parameterizations have been used around the world: Lin, Ferrier, WRF Single-Moment, Goddard Cumulus Ensemble, Morrison, Thompson, and WRF Double-Moment. More studies used one-moment parameterizations before 2020 and two-moment parameterizations after 2020. Seven out of nine parameterizations tended to overestimate precipitation. However, systematic biases of parameterizations differed in various regions. Except simulations using the Lin, Ferrier, and Goddard parameterizations that tended to underestimate precipitation over almost all locations, the remaining six parameterizations tended to overestimate, particularly over China, southeast Asia, western United States, and central Africa. This method could be used by other researchers to help understand how the increasingly massive body of scientific literature can be harnessed through the power of artificial intelligence to solve their research problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21392">HybridoNet-Adapt: A Domain-Adapted Framework for Accurate Lithium-Ion Battery RUL Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoa Tran, Bao Huynh, Tri Le, Lam Pham, Vy-Rin Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) in Lithium-ion battery (LIB) health management systems is crucial for ensuring reliability and safety. Current methods typically assume that training and testing data share the same distribution, overlooking the benefits of incorporating diverse data sources to enhance model performance. To address this limitation, we introduce a data-independent RUL prediction framework along with its domain adaptation (DA) approach, which leverages heterogeneous data sources for improved target predictions. Our approach integrates comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature extraction, denoising, and normalization, with a data-independent prediction model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Multihead Attention, and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) block, termed HybridoNet. The domain-adapted version, HybridoNet Adapt, is trained using a novel technique inspired by the Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) framework, a regression ensemble method, and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to learn domain-invariant features from labeled cycling data in the source and target domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, providing reliable RUL predictions for real-world applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21406">Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning: Discovering Symbolic Abstractions for Skill Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Keller, Daniel Tanneberg, Jan Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors. However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21411">Exploring the Roles of Large Language Models in Reshaping Transportation Systems: A Survey, Framework, and Roadmap</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Nie, Jian Sun, Wei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing demand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanli Ni, Haofeng Sun, Huiqing Ao, Hui Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in various application scenarios, but deploying them at the network edge poses significant challenges due to issues such as data privacy, computational resources, and latency. In this paper, we explore federated fine-tuning and collaborative reasoning techniques to facilitate the implementation of large AI models in resource-constrained wireless networks. Firstly, promising applications of large AI models within specific domains are discussed. Subsequently, federated fine-tuning methods are proposed to adapt large AI models to specific tasks or environments at the network edge, effectively addressing the challenges associated with communication overhead and enhancing communication efficiency. These methodologies follow clustered, hierarchical, and asynchronous paradigms to effectively tackle privacy issues and eliminate data silos. Furthermore, to enhance operational efficiency and reduce latency, efficient frameworks for model collaborative reasoning are developed, which include decentralized horizontal collaboration, cloud-edge-end vertical collaboration, and multi-access collaboration. Next, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in reducing the fine-tuning loss of large AI models across various downstream tasks. Finally, several open challenges and research opportunities are outlined.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Li, Manuel Milling, Bj\"orn W. Schuller</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved new levels of performance and spread in public usage with the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs). Initially inspired by human neurons and their connections, NNs have become the foundation of AI models for many advanced architectures. However, some of the most integral processes in the human brain, particularly neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in addition to the more spread neuroapoptosis have largely been ignored in DNN architecture design. Instead, contemporary AI development predominantly focuses on constructing advanced frameworks, such as large language models, which retain a static structure of neural connections during training and inference. In this light, we explore how neurogenesis, neuroapoptosis, and neuroplasticity can inspire future AI advances. Specifically, we examine analogous activities in artificial NNs, introducing the concepts of ``dropin'' for neurogenesis and revisiting ``dropout'' and structural pruning for neuroapoptosis. We additionally suggest neuroplasticity combining the two for future large NNs in ``life-long learning'' settings following the biological inspiration. We conclude by advocating for greater research efforts in this interdisciplinary domain and identifying promising directions for future exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhou Li, Haiyun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as the dominant paradigm for graph-structured learning, have long faced dual challenges of exponentially escalating computational complexity and inadequate cross-scenario generalization capability. With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional cross-modal relational reasoning capabilities and generalization capacities, thereby opening up novel pathways for overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional graph learning paradigms. However, current research predominantly concentrates on investigating the single-graph reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which fundamentally fails to address the critical requirement for coordinated reasoning across multiple heterogeneous graph data in real-world application scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint reasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories: knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group accompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of state-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This study not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph reasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization superiority in graph-structured learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Procedural Content Generation Benchmark for evaluating generative algorithms on different game content creation tasks. The benchmark comes with 12 game-related problems with multiple variants on each problem. Problems vary from creating levels of different kinds to creating rule sets for simple arcade games. Each problem has its own content representation, control parameters, and evaluation metrics for quality, diversity, and controllability. This benchmark is intended as a first step towards a standardized way of comparing generative algorithms. We use the benchmark to score three baseline algorithms: a random generator, an evolution strategy, and a genetic algorithm. Results show that some problems are easier to solve than others, as well as the impact the chosen objective has on quality, diversity, and controllability of the generated artifacts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for coding tasks, yet in most scenarios it is assumed that all relevant information can be either accessed in context or matches their training data. We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL, driven by large language models, are democratizing data access. Despite these advancements, enterprise deployments remain challenging due to the need to capture business-specific knowledge, handle complex queries, and meet expectations of continuous improvements. To address these issues, we designed and implemented GenEdit: our Text-to-SQL generation system that improves with user feedback. GenEdit builds and maintains a company-specific knowledge set, employs a pipeline of operators decomposing SQL generation, and uses feedback to update its knowledge set to improve future SQL generations.
  We describe GenEdit's architecture made of two core modules: (i) decomposed SQL generation; and (ii) knowledge set edits based on user feedback. For generation, GenEdit leverages compounding operators to improve knowledge retrieval and to create a plan as chain-of-thought steps that guides generation. GenEdit first retrieves relevant examples in an initial retrieval stage where original SQL queries are decomposed into sub-statements, clauses or sub-queries. It then also retrieves instructions and schema elements. Using the retrieved contextual information, GenEdit then generates step-by-step plan in natural language on how to produce the query. Finally, GenEdit uses the plan to generate SQL, minimizing the need for model reasoning, which enhances complex SQL generation. If necessary, GenEdit regenerates the query based on syntactic and semantic errors. The knowledge set edits are recommended through an interactive copilot, allowing users to iterate on their feedback and to regenerate SQL queries as needed. Each generation uses staged edits which update the generation prompt. Once the feedback is submitted, it gets merged after passing regression testing and obtaining an approval, improving future generations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxi Lu, Yuxiang Chai, Yaxuan Guo, Xi Yin, Liang Liu, Hao Wang, Guanjing Xiong, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks. To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongshuai Liu, Taeyeong Choi, Xin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning has been successful in building control policies to drive a complex system to desired states in various applications (e.g. games, robotics, etc.). To be specific, a number of parameters of policy can be automatically optimized from the observations of environment to be able to generate a sequence of decisions leading to the best performance. In this survey paper, we particularly explore such policy-learning techniques for another unique, practical use-case scenario--farming, in which critical decisions (e.g., water supply, heating, etc.) must be made in a timely manner to minimize risks (e.g., damage to plants) while maximizing the revenue (e.g., healthy crops) in the end. We first provide a broad overview of latest studies on it to identify not only domain-specific challenges but opportunities with potential solutions, some of which are suggested as promising directions for future research. Also, we then introduce our successful approach to being ranked second among 46 teams at the ''3rd Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge'' to use this specific example to discuss the lessons learned about important considerations for design to create autonomous farm-management systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Monks, Alison Harper, Amy Heather</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete-event simulation (DES) is widely used in healthcare Operations Research, but the models themselves are rarely shared. This limits their potential for reuse and long-term impact in the modelling and healthcare communities. This study explores the feasibility of using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to recreate published models using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), based on the descriptions provided in an academic journal. Using a structured methodology, we successfully generated, tested and internally reproduced two DES models, including user interfaces. The reported results were replicated for one model, but not the other, likely due to missing information on distributions. These models are substantially more complex than AI-generated DES models published to date. Given the challenges we faced in prompt engineering, code generation, and model testing, we conclude that our iterative approach to model development, systematic comparison and testing, and the expertise of our team were necessary to the success of our recreated simulation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danaja Rutar, Alva Markelius, Konstantinos Voudouris, Jos\'e Hern\'andez-Orallo, Lucy Cheke</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the core components of our world models is 'intuitive physics' - an understanding of objects, space, and causality. This capability enables us to predict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a composite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single, unified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide insights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology, enactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core capabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what functional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given the foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding objecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we evaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities compared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a combination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying objecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that, whilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of objecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional integration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge fully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the integrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are promising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward general-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board," "understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Lim, Roman Huerta, Alejandro Sotelo, Anthonie Quintela, Priyanka Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Sophisticated phishing attacks have emerged as a major cybersecurity threat, becoming more common and difficult to prevent. Though machine learning techniques have shown promise in detecting phishing attacks, they function mainly as "black boxes" without revealing their decision-making rationale. This lack of transparency erodes the trust of users and diminishes their effective threat response. We present EXPLICATE: a framework that enhances phishing detection through a three-component architecture: an ML-based classifier using domain-specific features, a dual-explanation layer combining LIME and SHAP for complementary feature-level insights, and an LLM enhancement using DeepSeek v3 to translate technical explanations into accessible natural language. Our experiments show that EXPLICATE attains 98.4 % accuracy on all metrics, which is on par with existing deep learning techniques but has better explainability. High-quality explanations are generated by the framework with an accuracy of 94.2 % as well as a consistency of 96.8\% between the LLM output and model prediction. We create EXPLICATE as a fully usable GUI application and a light Chrome extension, showing its applicability in many deployment situations. The research shows that high detection performance can go hand-in-hand with meaningful explainability in security applications. Most important, it addresses the critical divide between automated AI and user trust in phishing detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongcheol Kim, Chanjae Lee, Young Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for identifying malicious traffic, yet traditional signature-based methods struggle with zero-day attacks and high false positive rates. AI-driven packet-capture analysis offers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches rely heavily on flow-based or statistical features, limiting their ability to detect fine-grained attack patterns. This study proposes Xavier-CMAE, an enhanced Convolutional Multi-Head Attention Ensemble (CMAE) model that improves detection accuracy while reducing computational overhead. By replacing Word2Vec embeddings with a Hex2Int tokenizer and Xavier initialization, Xavier-CMAE eliminates pre-training, accelerates training, and achieves 99.971% accuracy with a 0.018% false positive rate, outperforming Word2Vec-based methods. Additionally, we introduce LLM-CMAE, which integrates pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) tokenizers into CMAE. While LLMs enhance feature extraction, their computational cost hinders real-time detection. LLM-CMAE balances efficiency and performance, reaching 99.969% accuracy with a 0.019% false positive rate. This work advances AI-powered IDS by (1) introducing a payload-based detection framework, (2) enhancing efficiency with Xavier-CMAE, and (3) integrating LLM tokenizers for improved real-time detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: In light of scaling laws, many AI institutions are intensifying efforts to construct advanced AIs on extensive collections of high-quality human data. However, in a rush to stay competitive, some institutions may inadvertently or even deliberately include unauthorized data (like privacy- or intellectual property-sensitive content) for AI training, which infringes on the rights of data owners. Compounding this issue, these advanced AI services are typically built on opaque cloud platforms, which restricts access to internal information during AI training and inference, leaving only the generated outputs available for forensics. Thus, despite the introduction of legal frameworks by various countries to safeguard data rights, uncovering evidence of data misuse in modern opaque AI applications remains a significant challenge. In this paper, inspired by the ability of isotopes to trace elements within chemical reactions, we introduce the concept of information isotopes and elucidate their properties in tracing training data within opaque AI systems. Furthermore, we propose an information isotope tracing method designed to identify and provide evidence of unauthorized data usage by detecting the presence of target information isotopes in AI generations. We conduct experiments on ten AI models (including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek) and four benchmark datasets in critical domains (medical data, copyrighted books, and news). Results show that our method can distinguish training datasets from non-training datasets with 99\% accuracy and significant evidence (p-value$<0.001$) by examining a data entry equivalent in length to a research paper. The findings show the potential of our work as an inclusive tool for empowering individuals, including those without expertise in AI, to safeguard their data rights in the rapidly evolving era of AI advancements and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text watermarking provides an effective solution for identifying synthetic text generated by large language models. However, existing techniques often focus on satisfying specific criteria while ignoring other key aspects, lacking a unified evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose the Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Watermark (CEFW), a unified framework that comprehensively evaluates watermarking methods across five key dimensions: ease of detection, fidelity of text quality, minimal embedding cost, robustness to adversarial attacks, and imperceptibility to prevent imitation or forgery. By assessing watermarks according to all these key criteria, CEFW offers a thorough evaluation of their practicality and effectiveness. Moreover, we introduce a simple and effective watermarking method called Balanced Watermark (BW), which guarantees robustness and imperceptibility through balancing the way watermark information is added. Extensive experiments show that BW outperforms existing methods in overall performance across all evaluation dimensions. We release our code to the community for future research. https://github.com/DrankXs/BalancedWatermark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Qiu, Zelai Xu, Qixin Tan, Wenhao Tang, Chao Yu, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the safety of autonomous driving policy is of great importance, and reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for discovering critical vulnerabilities in driving policies. However, existing RL-based approaches often struggle to identify vulnerabilities that are both effective-meaning the autonomous vehicle is genuinely responsible for the accidents-and diverse-meaning they span various failure types. To address these challenges, we propose AED, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically discover effective and diverse vulnerabilities in autonomous driving policies. We first utilize an LLM to automatically design reward functions for RL training. Then we let the LLM consider a diverse set of accident types and train adversarial policies for different accident types in parallel. Finally, we use preference-based learning to filter ineffective accidents and enhance the effectiveness of each vulnerability. Experiments across multiple simulated traffic scenarios and tested policies show that AED uncovers a broader range of vulnerabilities and achieves higher attack success rates compared with expert-designed rewards, thereby reducing the need for manual reward engineering and improving the diversity and effectiveness of vulnerability discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on some task-specific datasets has been a primary use of LLMs. However, it has been empirically observed that this approach to enhancing capability inevitably compromises safety, a phenomenon also known as the safety-capability trade-off in LLM fine-tuning. This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between safety and capability in two primary safety-aware LLM fine-tuning strategies, providing new insights into the effects of data similarity, context overlap, and alignment loss landscape. Our theoretical results characterize the fundamental limits of the safety-capability trade-off in LLM fine-tuning, which are also validated by numerical experiments.</p>

To harness this potential, we propose a solution that curates and integrates synthetic data while introducing a method to transfer its physical realism to the model, significantly reducing unwanted artifacts. Through experiments on three representative tasks emphasizing physical consistency, we demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing physical fidelity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Ariff Syed Hesham, Yun Liu, Guolei Sun, Henghui Ding, Jing Yang, Ender Konukoglu, Xue Geng, Xudong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video semantic segmentation (VSS) plays a vital role in understanding the temporal evolution of scenes. Traditional methods often segment videos frame-by-frame or in a short temporal window, leading to limited temporal context, redundant computations, and heavy memory requirements. To this end, we introduce a Temporal Video State Space Sharing (TV3S) architecture to leverage Mamba state space models for temporal feature sharing. Our model features a selective gating mechanism that efficiently propagates relevant information across video frames, eliminating the need for a memory-heavy feature pool. By processing spatial patches independently and incorporating shifted operation, TV3S supports highly parallel computation in both training and inference stages, which reduces the delay in sequential state space processing and improves the scalability for long video sequences. Moreover, TV3S incorporates information from prior frames during inference, achieving long-range temporal coherence and superior adaptability to extended sequences. Evaluations on the VSPW and Cityscapes datasets reveal that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new standard for VSS with consistent results across long video sequences. By achieving a good balance between accuracy and efficiency, TV3S shows a significant advancement in spatiotemporal modeling, paving the way for efficient video analysis.

<p>Abstract: The rapid increase in cybersecurity vulnerabilities necessitates automated tools for analyzing and classifying vulnerability reports. This paper presents a novel Vulnerability Report Classifier that leverages the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to perform multi-label classification of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The classifier predicts both the severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical) and vulnerability types (e.g., Buffer Overflow, XSS) from textual descriptions. We introduce a custom training pipeline using a combined loss function-Cross-Entropy for severity and Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits for types-integrated into a Hugging Face Trainer subclass. Experiments on recent NVD data demonstrate promising results, with decreasing evaluation loss across epochs. The system is deployed via a REST API and a Streamlit UI, enabling real-time vulnerability analysis.

<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control, but its realworld deployment remains challenging due to its vulnerability to environmental perturbations. Existing white-box adversarial attack methods, adapted from supervised learning, fail to effectively target DRL agents as they overlook temporal dynamics and indiscriminately perturb all state dimensions, limiting their impact on long-term rewards. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Gradient-Masked Reinforcement (AGMR) Attack, a white-box attack method that combines DRL with a gradient-based soft masking mechanism to dynamically identify critical state dimensions and optimize adversarial policies. AGMR selectively allocates perturbations to the most impactful state features and incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGMR outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods in degrading the performance of the victim agent and enhances the victim agent's robustness through adversarial defense mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Laufer, Jon Kleinberg, Hoda Heidari</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent policy proposals aim to improve the safety of general-purpose AI, but there is little understanding of the efficacy of different regulatory approaches to AI safety. We present a strategic model that explores the interactions between the regulator, the general-purpose AI technology creators, and domain specialists--those who adapt the AI for specific applications. Our analysis examines how different regulatory measures, targeting different parts of the development chain, affect the outcome of the development process. In particular, we assume AI technology is described by two key attributes: safety and performance. The regulator first sets a minimum safety standard that applies to one or both players, with strict penalties for non-compliance. The general-purpose creator then develops the technology, establishing its initial safety and performance levels. Next, domain specialists refine the AI for their specific use cases, and the resulting revenue is distributed between the specialist and generalist through an ex-ante bargaining process. Our analysis of this game reveals two key insights: First, weak safety regulation imposed only on the domain specialists can backfire. While it might seem logical to regulate use cases (as opposed to the general-purpose technology), our analysis shows that weak regulations targeting domain specialists alone can unintentionally reduce safety. This effect persists across a wide range of settings. Second, in sharp contrast to the previous finding, we observe that stronger, well-placed regulation can in fact benefit all players subjected to it. When regulators impose appropriate safety standards on both AI creators and domain specialists, the regulation functions as a commitment mechanism, leading to safety and performance gains, surpassing what is achieved under no regulation or regulating one player only.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Swerdlow, Mihir Prabhudesai, Siddharth Gandhi, Deepak Pathak, Katerina Fragkiadaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal generative models that can understand and generate across multiple modalities are dominated by autoregressive (AR) approaches, which process tokens sequentially from left to right, or top to bottom. These models jointly handle images, text, video, and audio for various tasks such as image captioning, question answering, and image generation. In this work, we explore discrete diffusion models as a unified generative formulation in the joint text and image domain, building upon their recent success in text generation. Discrete diffusion models offer several advantages over AR models, including improved control over quality versus diversity of generated samples, the ability to perform joint multimodal inpainting (across both text and image domains), and greater controllability in generation through guidance. Leveraging these benefits, we present the first Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion (UniDisc) model which is capable of jointly understanding and generating text and images for a variety of downstream tasks. We compare UniDisc to multimodal AR models, performing a scaling analysis and demonstrating that UniDisc outperforms them in terms of both performance and inference-time compute, enhanced controllability, editability, inpainting, and flexible trade-off between inference time and generation quality.

<p>Abstract: Visual narrative generation transforms textual narratives into sequences of images illustrating the content of the text. However, generating visual narratives that are faithful to the input text and self-consistent across generated images remains an open challenge, due to the lack of knowledge constraints used for planning the stories. In this work, we propose a new benchmark, VinaBench, to address this challenge. Our benchmark annotates the underlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples, offering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual storytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further propose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated narrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual narrative. Our results across three generative vision models demonstrate that learning with VinaBench's knowledge constraints effectively improves the faithfulness and cohesion of generated visual narratives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Usama Zafar, Andr\'e Teixeira, Salman Toor</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, but it remains vulnerable to poisoning attacks that compromise model integrity. Existing defenses often rely on external datasets or predefined heuristics (e.g. number of malicious clients), limiting their effectiveness and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a privacy-preserving defense framework that leverages a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic data at the server for authenticating client updates, eliminating the need for external datasets. Our framework is scalable, adaptive, and seamlessly integrates into FL workflows. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its robust performance against a variety of poisoning attacks, achieving high True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) of malicious and benign clients, respectively, while maintaining model accuracy. The proposed framework offers a practical and effective solution for securing federated learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reilly Cannon, Nicolette M. Laird, Caesar Vazquez, Andy Lin, Amy Wagler, Tony Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has emerged as a promising method to address limited data availability and privacy concerns. With the sharp increase in the performance of large language models in recent years, researchers have been interested in applying these models to the generation of tabular data. However, little is known about the quality of the generated tabular data from large language models. The predominant method for assessing the quality of synthetic tabular data is the train-synthetic-test-real approach, where the artificial examples are compared to the original by how well machine learning models, trained separately on the real and synthetic sets, perform in some downstream tasks. This method does not directly measure how closely the distribution of generated data approximates that of the original. This paper introduces rigorous methods for directly assessing synthetic tabular data against real data by looking at inter-column dependencies within the data. We find that large language models (GPT-2), both when queried via few-shot prompting and when fine-tuned, and GAN (CTGAN) models do not produce data with dependencies that mirror the original real data. Results from this study can inform future practice in synthetic data generation to improve data quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkat Adithya Amula, Sunayana Samavedam, Saurabh Saini, Avani Gupta, Narayanan P J</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are susceptible to {\em backdoor attacks} involving malicious attackers perturbing a small subset of training data with a {\em trigger} to causes misclassifications. Various triggers have been used, including semantic triggers that are easily realizable without requiring the attacker to manipulate the image. The emergence of generative AI has eased the generation of varied poisoned samples. Robustness across types of triggers is crucial to effective defense. We propose Prototype Guided Backdoor Defense (PGBD), a robust post-hoc defense that scales across different trigger types, including previously unsolved semantic triggers. PGBD exploits displacements in the geometric spaces of activations to penalize movements toward the trigger. This is done using a novel sanitization loss of a post-hoc fine-tuning step. The geometric approach scales easily to all types of attacks. PGBD achieves better performance across all settings. We also present the first defense against a new semantic attack on celebrity face images. Project page: \hyperlink{https://venkatadithya9.github.io/pgbd.github.io/}{this https URL}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Etaat, Dvij Kalaria, Nima Rahmanian, Shankar Sastry</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical agility is a necessary skill in competitive table tennis, but by no means sufficient. Champions excel in this fast-paced and highly dynamic environment by anticipating their opponent's intent - buying themselves the necessary time to react. In this work, we take one step towards designing such an anticipatory agent. Previous works have developed systems capable of real-time table tennis gameplay, though they often do not leverage anticipation. Among the works that forecast opponent actions, their approaches are limited by dataset size and variety. Our paper contributes (1) a scalable system for reconstructing monocular video of table tennis matches in 3D and (2) an uncertainty-aware controller that anticipates opponent actions. We demonstrate in simulation that our policy improves the ball return rate against high-speed hits from 49.9% to 59.0% as compared to a baseline non-anticipatory policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caspar Meijer, Jiyue Huang, Shreshtha Sharma, Elena Lazovik, Lydia Y. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for time series forecasting (TSF) enables clients with privacy-sensitive time series (TS) data to collaboratively learn accurate forecasting models, for example, in energy load prediction. Unfortunately, privacy risks in FL persist, as servers can potentially reconstruct clients' training data through gradient inversion attacks (GIA). Although GIA is demonstrated for image classification tasks, little is known about time series regression tasks. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive empirical study on inverting TS data across 4 TSF models and 4 datasets, identifying the unique challenges of reconstructing both observations and targets of TS data. We then propose TS-Inverse, a novel GIA that improves the inversion of TS data by (i) learning a gradient inversion model that outputs quantile predictions, (ii) a unique loss function that incorporates periodicity and trend regularization, and (iii) regularization according to the quantile predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate a remarkable performance of TS-Inverse, achieving at least a 2x-10x improvement in terms of the sMAPE metric over existing GIA methods on TS data.

<p>Abstract: While the previous chapters have shown how machine translation (MT) can be useful, in this chapter we discuss some of the side-effects and risks that are associated, and how they might be mitigated. With the move to neural MT and approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an associated impact on climate change, as the models built by multinational corporations are massive. They are hugely expensive to train, consume large amounts of electricity, and output huge volumes of kgCO2 to boot. However, smaller models which still perform to a high level of quality can be built with much lower carbon footprints, and tuning pre-trained models saves on the requirement to train from scratch. We also discuss the possible detrimental effects of MT on translators and other users. The topics of copyright and ownership of data are discussed, as well as ethical considerations on data and MT use. Finally, we show how if done properly, using MT in crisis scenarios can save lives, and we provide a method of how this might be done.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbo Li, Lingjie Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern resource-sharing systems, multiple agents access limited resources with unknown stochastic conditions to perform tasks. When multiple agents access the same resource (arm) simultaneously, they compete for successful usage, leading to contention and reduced rewards. This motivates our study of competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) games. In this paper, we study a new N-player K-arm competitive MAB game, where non-myopic players (agents) compete with each other to form diverse private estimations of unknown arms over time. Their possible collisions on same arms and time-varying nature of arm rewards make the policy analysis more involved than existing studies for myopic players. We explicitly analyze the threshold-based structures of social optimum and existing selfish policy, showing that the latter causes prolonged convergence time $\Omega(\frac{K}{\eta^2}\ln({\frac{KN}{\delta}}))$, while socially optimal policy with coordinated communication reduces it to $\mathcal{O}(\frac{K}{N\eta^2}\ln{(\frac{K}{\delta})})$. Based on the comparison, we prove that the competition among selfish players for the best arm can result in an infinite price of anarchy (PoA), indicating an arbitrarily large efficiency loss compared to social optimum. We further prove that no informational (non-monetary) mechanism (including Bayesian persuasion) can reduce the infinite PoA, as the strategic misreporting by non-myopic players undermines such approaches. To address this, we propose a Combined Informational and Side-Payment (CISP) mechanism, which provides socially optimal arm recommendations with proper informational and monetary incentives to players according to their time-varying private beliefs. Our CISP mechanism keeps ex-post budget balanced for social planner and ensures truthful reporting from players, achieving the minimum PoA=1 and same convergence time as social optimum.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoran Xu, Zhaoqian Xue, Chi Zhang, Jhonatan Medri, Junjie Xiong, Jiayan Zhou, Jin Jin, Yongfeng Zhang, Siyuan Ma, Lingyao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Investigating the public experience of urgent care facilities is essential for promoting community healthcare development. Traditional survey methods often fall short due to limited scope, time, and spatial coverage. Crowdsourcing through online reviews or social media offers a valuable approach to gaining such insights. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), extracting nuanced perceptions from reviews has become feasible. This study collects Google Maps reviews across the DMV and Florida areas and conducts prompt engineering with the GPT model to analyze the aspect-based sentiment of urgent care. We first analyze the geospatial patterns of various aspects, including interpersonal factors, operational efficiency, technical quality, finances, and facilities. Next, we determine Census Block Group(CBG)-level characteristics underpinning differences in public perception, including population density, median income, GINI Index, rent-to-income ratio, household below poverty rate, no insurance rate, and unemployment rate. Our results show that interpersonal factors and operational efficiency emerge as the strongest determinants of patient satisfaction in urgent care, while technical quality, finances, and facilities show no significant independent effects when adjusted for in multivariate models. Among socioeconomic and demographic factors, only population density demonstrates a significant but modest association with patient ratings, while the remaining factors exhibit no significant correlations. Overall, this study highlights the potential of crowdsourcing to uncover the key factors that matter to residents and provide valuable insights for stakeholders to improve public satisfaction with urgent care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation, audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FinAudio}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1) ASR for short financial audio, 2) ASR for long financial audio, and 3) summarization of long financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively, and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the \textsc{FinAudio} benchmark. Then, we evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on \textsc{FinAudio}. Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLMs. All datasets and codes will be released.</p>

We introduce the Metadata-Sensitive Weighted-Encoding Ensemble Model (MSWEEM), which integrates annotator meta-features like fatigue and speeding.

Second, we find that incorporating signals of annotator behavior, such as speed and fatigue, significantly boosts model performance. Third, we find that annotators with higher qualifications, such as Master's, deliver more consistent and faster annotations. Given the increasing uncertainty over annotation quality, our experiments show that understanding annotator patterns is crucial for enhancing model accuracy in user behavior prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can predict human attitudes based on other attitudes, but this work has largely focused on predictions from highly similar and interrelated attitudes. In contrast, human attitudes are often strongly associated even across disparate and dissimilar topics. Using a novel dataset of human responses toward diverse attitude statements, we found that a frontier language model (GPT-4o) was able to recreate the pairwise correlations among individual attitudes and to predict individuals' attitudes from one another. Crucially, in an advance over prior work, we tested GPT-4o's ability to predict in the absence of surface-similarity between attitudes, finding that while surface similarity improves prediction accuracy, the model was still highly-capable of generating meaningful social inferences between dissimilar attitudes. Altogether, our findings indicate that LLMs capture crucial aspects of the deeper, latent structure of human belief systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ooha Lakkadi Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, in conjunction with a detailed anthropological framework, to investigate potential historical connections between the visual morphology of the Indus Valley script and pictographic systems of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor. Through an ensemble methodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we demonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold higher visual similarity to the Indus script (61.7%-63.5%) than to the Bronze Age Proto-Cuneiform (10.2%-10.9%) or Proto-Elamite (7.6%-8.7%) systems. Additionally and contrarily to our current understanding of the networks of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Indus script unexpectedly maps closer to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts, with a mean cosine similarity of 0.629, than to the aforementioned contemporaneous West Asian signaries, both of which recorded mean cosine similarities of 0.104 and 0.080 despite their close geographic proximity and evident trade relations. Across various dimensionality reduction practices and clustering methodologies, the Indus script consistently clusters closest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts. Our computational results align with qualitative observations of specific pictorial parallels in numeral systems, gender markers, and key iconographic elements; this is further supported by archaeological evidence of sustained contact networks along the ancient Shu-Shendu road in tandem with the Indus Valley Civilization's decline, providing a plausible transmission pathway. While alternative explanations cannot be ruled out, the specificity and consistency of observed similarities challenge conventional narratives of isolated script development and suggest more complex ancient cultural transmission networks between South and East Asia than previously recognized.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the ZJUKLAB team's submission for SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning Sensitive Content from Large Language Models. This task aims to selectively erase sensitive knowledge from large language models, avoiding both over-forgetting and under-forgetting issues. We propose an unlearning system that leverages Model Merging (specifically TIES-Merging), combining two specialized models into a more balanced unlearned model. Our system achieves competitive results, ranking second among 26 teams, with an online score of 0.944 for Task Aggregate and 0.487 for overall Aggregate. In this paper, we also conduct local experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning process, examining performance trajectories, loss dynamics, and weight perspectives, along with several supplementary experiments, to understand the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we analyze the shortcomings of our method and evaluation metrics, emphasizing that MIA scores and ROUGE-based metrics alone are insufficient to fully evaluate successful unlearning. Finally, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation methodologies and rethinking of unlearning objectives in future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Shoyeb Raihan, Zhichao Liu, Tanveer Hossain Bhuiyan, Imtiaz Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating the discovery and manufacturing of advanced materials with specific properties is a critical yet formidable challenge due to vast search space, high costs of experiments, and time-intensive nature of material characterization. In recent years, active learning, where a surrogate machine learning (ML) model mimics the scientific discovery process of a human scientist, has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges by guiding experimentation toward high-value outcomes with a limited budget. Among the diverse active learning philosophies, the concept of surprise (capturing the divergence between expected and observed outcomes) has demonstrated significant potential to drive experimental trials and refine predictive models. Scientific discovery often stems from surprise thereby making it a natural driver to guide the search process. Despite its promise, prior studies leveraging surprise metrics such as Shannon and Bayesian surprise lack mechanisms to account for prior confidence, leading to excessive exploration of uncertain regions that may not yield useful information. To address this, we propose the Confidence-Adjusted Surprise Measure for Active Resourceful Trials (CA-SMART), a novel Bayesian active learning framework tailored for optimizing data-driven experimentation. On a high level, CA-SMART incorporates Confidence-Adjusted Surprise (CAS) to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation by amplifying surprises in regions where the model is more certain while discounting them in highly uncertain areas. We evaluated CA-SMART on two benchmark functions (Six-Hump Camelback and Griewank) and in predicting the fatigue strength of steel. The results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional surprise metrics, standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) acquisition functions and conventional ML methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yedan Shen, Kaixin Wu, Yuechen Ding, Jingyuan Wen, Hong Liu, Mingjie Zhong, Zhouhan Lin, Jia Xu, Linjian Mo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunquan Gao, Zhiguo Zhang, Praveen Kumar Donta, Chinmaya Kumar Dehury, Xiujun Wang, Dusit Niyato, Qiyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across diverse industries, driving demand for mobile device support. However, existing mobile inference frameworks often rely on a single processor per model, limiting hardware utilization and causing suboptimal performance and energy efficiency. Expanding DNN accessibility on mobile platforms requires adaptive, resource-efficient solutions to meet rising computational needs without compromising functionality. Parallel inference of multiple DNNs on heterogeneous processors remains challenging. Some works partition DNN operations into subgraphs for parallel execution across processors, but these often create excessive subgraphs based only on hardware compatibility, increasing scheduling complexity and memory overhead.
  To address this, we propose an Advanced Multi-DNN Model Scheduling (ADMS) strategy for optimizing multi-DNN inference on mobile heterogeneous processors. ADMS constructs an optimal subgraph partitioning strategy offline, balancing hardware operation support and scheduling granularity, and uses a processor-state-aware algorithm to dynamically adjust workloads based on real-time conditions. This ensures efficient workload distribution and maximizes processor utilization. Experiments show ADMS reduces multi-DNN inference latency by 4.04 times compared to vanilla frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Liu, Yixiong Zou, Yuhua Li, Ruixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CDFSS) is proposed to transfer the pixel-level segmentation capabilities learned from large-scale source-domain datasets to downstream target-domain datasets, with only a few annotated images per class. In this paper, we focus on a well-observed but unresolved phenomenon in CDFSS: for target domains, particularly those distant from the source domain, segmentation performance peaks at the very early epochs, and declines sharply as the source-domain training proceeds. We delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation: low-level features are vulnerable to domain shifts, leading to sharper loss landscapes during the source-domain training, which is the devil of CDFSS. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a method that includes two plug-and-play modules: one to flatten the loss landscapes for low-level features during source-domain training as a novel sharpness-aware minimization method, and the other to directly supplement target-domain information to the model during target-domain testing by low-level-based calibration. Extensive experiments on four target datasets validate our rationale and demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CDFSS signifcantly by 3.71% and 5.34% average MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanishka Ranaweera, Dinh C. Nguyen, Pubudu N. Pathirana, David Smith, Ming Ding, Thierry Rakotoarivelo, Aruna Seneviratne</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as an attractive approach to protect data privacy by eliminating the need for sharing clients' data while reducing communication costs compared with centralized machine learning algorithms. However, recent studies have shown that federated learning alone does not guarantee privacy, as private data may still be inferred from the uploaded parameters to the central server. In order to successfully avoid data leakage, adopting differential privacy (DP) in the local optimization process or in the local update aggregation process has emerged as two feasible ways for achieving sample-level or user-level privacy guarantees respectively, in federated learning models. However, compared to their non-private equivalents, these approaches suffer from a poor utility. To improve the privacy-utility trade-off, we present a modification to these vanilla differentially private algorithms based on a Haar wavelet transformation step and a novel noise injection scheme that significantly lowers the asymptotic bound of the noise variance. We also present a holistic convergence analysis of our proposed algorithm, showing that our method yields better convergence performance than the vanilla DP algorithms. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in model utility while maintaining the same privacy guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanishka Ranaweera, David Smith, Pubudu N. Pathirana, Ming Ding, Thierry Rakotoarivelo, Aruna Seneviratne</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach for privacy-preserving machine learning. However, ensuring differential privacy (DP) in FL presents challenges due to the trade-off between model utility and privacy protection. Clipping gradients before aggregation is a common strategy to limit privacy loss, but selecting an optimal clipping norm is non-trivial, as excessively high values compromise privacy, while overly restrictive clipping degrades model performance. In this work, we propose an adaptive clipping mechanism that dynamically adjusts the clipping norm using a multi-objective optimization framework. By integrating privacy and utility considerations into the optimization objective, our approach balances privacy preservation with model accuracy. We theoretically analyze the convergence properties of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our results show that adaptive clipping consistently outperforms fixed-clipping baselines, achieving improved accuracy under the same privacy constraints. This work highlights the potential of dynamic clipping strategies to enhance privacy-utility trade-offs in differentially private federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samra Irshad, Seungkyu Lee, Nassir Navab, Hong Joo Lee, Seong Tae Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of adversarial examples in the physical world poses significant challenges to the deployment of Deep Neural Networks in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Most existing methods for crafting physical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary modifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to specific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world adversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally occurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical objects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges organically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual deterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step approach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network is employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the context of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the characteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the second step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code, strategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly alters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate adversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually realistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading neural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign datasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and physical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater robustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world adversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a model's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Wu, Congrong Xu, Binbin Huang, Andreas Geiger, Anpei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D reconstruction and generation have demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, a notable conditioning gap can be observed between these two fields, e.g., scalable 3D scene reconstruction often requires densely captured views, whereas 3D generation typically relies on a single or no input view, which significantly limits their applications. We found that the source of this phenomenon lies in the misalignment between 3D constraints and generative priors. To address this problem, we propose a reconstruction-driven video diffusion model that learns to condition video frames on artifact-prone RGB-D renderings. Moreover, we propose a cyclical fusion pipeline that iteratively adds restoration frames from the generative model to the training set, enabling progressive expansion and addressing the viewpoint saturation limitations seen in previous reconstruction and generation pipelines. Our evaluation, including view synthesis from sparse view and masked input, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karanbir Singh, William Ngu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in retrieving accessible information have evolved faster in the last few years compared to the decades since the internet's creation. Search engines, like Google, have been the number one way to find relevant data. They have always relied on the user's abilities to find the best information in its billions of links and sources at everybody's fingertips. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has completely transformed the field of information retrieval. The LLMs excel not only at retrieving relevant knowledge but also at summarizing it effectively, making information more accessible and consumable for users. On top of it, the rise of AI Agents has introduced another aspect to information retrieval i.e. dynamic information retrieval which enables the integration of real-time data such as weather forecasts, and financial data with the knowledge base to curate context-aware knowledge. However, despite these advancements the agents remain susceptible to issues of bias and fairness, challenges deeply rooted within the knowledge base and training of LLMs. This study introduces a novel approach to bias-aware knowledge retrieval by leveraging agentic framework and the innovative use of bias detectors as tools to identify and highlight inherent biases in the retrieved content. By empowering users with transparency and awareness, this approach aims to foster more equitable information systems and promote the development of responsible AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> HyeYoung Lee, Pavel Tsoi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate patient mortality prediction enables effective risk stratification, leading to personalized treatment plans and improved patient outcomes. However, predicting mortality in healthcare remains a significant challenge, with existing studies often focusing on specific diseases or limited predictor sets. This study evaluates machine learning models for all-cause in-hospital mortality prediction using the MIMIC-III database, employing a comprehensive feature engineering approach. Guided by clinical expertise and literature, we extracted key features such as vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), laboratory results (e.g., creatinine, glucose), and demographic information. The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.94, significantly outperforming other machine learning and deep learning approaches. This demonstrates Random Forest's robustness in handling high-dimensional, noisy clinical data and its potential for developing effective clinical decision support tools. Our findings highlight the importance of careful feature engineering for accurate mortality prediction. We conclude by discussing implications for clinical adoption and propose future directions, including enhancing model robustness and tailoring prediction models for specific diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Garc\'ia-M\'arquez, Nuria Rodr\'iguez-Barroso, M. Victoria Luz\'on, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence systems has amplified societal concerns regarding their usage, necessitating regulatory frameworks that encompass data privacy. Federated Learning (FL) is posed as potential solution to data privacy challenges in distributed machine learning by enabling collaborative model training {without data sharing}. However, FL systems remain vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, where malicious nodes contribute corrupted model updates. While Byzantine Resilient operators have emerged as a widely adopted robust aggregation algorithm to mitigate these attacks, its efficacy diminishes significantly in high-dimensional parameter spaces, sometimes leading to poor performing models. This paper introduces Layerwise Cosine Aggregation, a novel aggregation scheme designed to enhance robustness of these rules in such high-dimensional settings while preserving computational efficiency. A theoretical analysis is presented, demonstrating the superior robustness of the proposed Layerwise Cosine Aggregation compared to original robust aggregation operators. Empirical evaluation across diverse image classification datasets, under varying data distributions and Byzantine attack scenarios, consistently demonstrates the improved performance of Layerwise Cosine Aggregation, achieving up to a 16% increase in model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Liu, Zonglin Yang, Tong Xie, Jinjie Ni, Ben Gao, Yuqiang Li, Shixiang Tang, Wanli Ouyang, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for applications like resource scheduling and risk management, where multi-step predictions provide a comprehensive view of future trends. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a mainstream approach for addressing forecasting uncertainties, with Conformal Prediction (CP) gaining attention due to its model-agnostic nature and statistical guarantees. However, most variants of CP are designed for single-step predictions and face challenges in multi-step scenarios, such as reliance on real-time data and limited scalability. This highlights the need for CP methods specifically tailored to multi-step forecasting. We propose the Dual-Splitting Conformal Prediction (DSCP) method, a novel CP approach designed to capture inherent dependencies within time-series data for multi-step forecasting. Experimental results on real-world datasets from four different domains demonstrate that the proposed DSCP significantly outperforms existing CP variants in terms of the Winkler Score, achieving a performance improvement of up to 23.59% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we deployed the DSCP approach for renewable energy generation and IT load forecasting in power management of a real-world trajectory-based application, achieving an 11.25% reduction in carbon emissions through predictive optimization of data center operations and controls.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-to-music Generation, including video-to-music and image-to-music tasks, is a significant branch of multimodal artificial intelligence demonstrating vast application prospects in fields such as film scoring, short video creation, and dance music synthesis. However, compared to the rapid development of modalities like text and images, research in vision-to-music is still in its preliminary stage due to its complex internal structure and the difficulty of modeling dynamic relationships with video. Existing surveys focus on general music generation without comprehensive discussion on vision-to-music. In this paper, we systematically review the research progress in the field of vision-to-music generation. We first analyze the technical characteristics and core challenges for three input types: general videos, human movement videos, and images, as well as two output types of symbolic music and audio music. We then summarize the existing methodologies on vision-to-music generation from the architecture perspective. A detailed review of common datasets and evaluation metrics is provided. Finally, we discuss current challenges and promising directions for future research. We hope our survey can inspire further innovation in vision-to-music generation and the broader field of multimodal generation in academic research and industrial applications.

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of embodied intelligence, leveraging large-scale human data for high-level imitation learning on humanoid robots has become a focal point of interest in both academia and industry. However, applying humanoid robots to precision operation domains remains challenging due to the complexities they face in perception and control processes, the long-standing physical differences in morphology and actuation mechanisms between humanoid robots and humans, and the lack of task-relevant features obtained from egocentric vision. To address the issue of covariate shift in imitation learning, this paper proposes an imitation learning algorithm tailored for humanoid robots. By focusing on the primary task objectives, filtering out background information, and incorporating channel feature fusion with spatial attention mechanisms, the proposed algorithm suppresses environmental disturbances and utilizes a dynamic weight update strategy to significantly improve the success rate of humanoid robots in accomplishing target tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robustness and scalability across various typical task scenarios, providing new ideas and approaches for autonomous learning and control in humanoid robots.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jizhou Han, Chenhao Ding, Yuhang He, Songlin Dong, Qiang Wang, Xinyuan Gao, Yihong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental Learning (FSCIL) enables models to learn new classes from limited data while retaining performance on previously learned classes. Traditional FSCIL methods often require fine-tuning parameters with limited new class data and suffer from a separation between learning new classes and utilizing old knowledge. Inspired by the analogical learning mechanisms of the human brain, we propose a novel analogical generative method. Our approach includes the Brain-Inspired Analogical Generator (BiAG), which derives new class weights from existing classes without parameter fine-tuning during incremental stages. BiAG consists of three components: Weight Self-Attention Module (WSA), Weight & Prototype Analogical Attention Module (WPAA), and Semantic Conversion Module (SCM). SCM uses Neural Collapse theory for semantic conversion, WSA supplements new class weights, and WPAA computes analogies to generate new class weights. Experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher final and average accuracy compared to SOTA methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoencoder-based structures have dominated recent learned image compression methods. However, the inherent information loss associated with autoencoders limits their rate-distortion performance at high bit rates and restricts their flexibility of rate adaptation. In this paper, we present a variable-rate image compression model based on invertible transform to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we design a lightweight multi-scale invertible neural network, which bijectively maps the input image into multi-scale latent representations. To improve the compression efficiency, a multi-scale spatial-channel context model with extended gain units is devised to estimate the entropy of the latent representation from high to low levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing variable-rate methods, and remains competitive with recent multi-model approaches. Notably, our method is the first learned image compression solution that outperforms VVC across a very wide range of bit rates using a single model, especially at high bit rates.The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/hytu99/MSINN-VRLIC}{https://github.com/hytu99/MSINN-VRLIC}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks are among the most effective, practical, and stealthy attacks in deep learning. In this paper, we consider a practical scenario where a developer obtains a deep model from a third party and uses it as part of a safety-critical system. The developer wants to inspect the model for potential backdoors prior to system deployment. We find that most existing detection techniques make assumptions that are not applicable to this scenario. In this paper, we present a novel framework for detecting backdoors under realistic restrictions. We generate candidate triggers by deductively searching over the space of possible triggers. We construct and optimize a smoothed version of Attack Success Rate as our search objective. Starting from a broad class of template attacks and just using the forward pass of a deep model, we reverse engineer the backdoor attack. We conduct extensive evaluation on a wide range of attacks, models, and datasets, with our technique performing almost perfectly across these settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs) treat visual tokens as "a sequence of text", integrating them with text tokens into a large language model (LLM). However, a great quantity of visual tokens significantly increases the demand for computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose InternVL-X, which outperforms the InternVL model in both performance and efficiency by incorporating three visual token compression methods. First, we propose a novel vision-language projector, PVTC. This component integrates adjacent visual embeddings to form a local query and utilizes the transformed CLS token as a global query, then performs point-to-region cross-attention through these local and global queries to more effectively convert visual features. Second, we present a layer-wise visual token compression module, LVTC, which compresses tokens in the LLM shallow layers and then expands them through upsampling and residual connections in the deeper layers. This significantly enhances the model computational efficiency. Futhermore, we propose an efficient high resolution slicing method, RVTC, which dynamically adjusts the number of visual tokens based on image area or length filtering. RVTC greatly enhances training efficiency with only a slight reduction in performance. By utilizing 20% or fewer visual tokens, InternVL-X achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 public MLLM benchmarks, and improves the average metric by 2.34% across 12 tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixu Li, Zhiheng Fu, Yupeng Hu, Zhiwei Chen, Haokun Wen, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) facilitates image retrieval through a multimodal query consisting of a reference image and modification text. The reference image defines the retrieval context, while the modification text specifies desired alterations. However, existing CIR datasets predominantly employ coarse-grained modification text (CoarseMT), which inadequately captures fine-grained retrieval intents. This limitation introduces two key challenges: (1) ignoring detailed differences leads to imprecise positive samples, and (2) greater ambiguity arises when retrieving visually similar images. These issues degrade retrieval accuracy, necessitating manual result filtering or repeated queries. To address these limitations, we develop a robust fine-grained CIR data annotation pipeline that minimizes imprecise positive samples and enhances CIR systems' ability to discern modification intents accurately. Using this pipeline, we refine the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets to create two fine-grained CIR datasets: Fine-FashionIQ and Fine-CIRR. Furthermore, we introduce FineCIR, the first CIR framework explicitly designed to parse the modification text. FineCIR effectively captures fine-grained modification semantics and aligns them with ambiguous visual entities, enhancing retrieval precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FineCIR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIR baselines on both fine-grained and traditional CIR benchmark datasets.

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based speech enhancement models yield impressive results. However, their heterogeneous and complex structure restricts model compression potential, resulting in greater complexity and reduced hardware efficiency. Additionally, these models are not tailored for streaming and low-power applications. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a low-power streaming speech enhancement accelerator through model and hardware optimization. The proposed high performance model is optimized for hardware execution with the co-design of model compression and target application, which reduces 93.9\% of model size by the proposed domain-aware and streaming-aware pruning techniques. The required latency is further reduced with batch normalization-based transformers. Additionally, we employed softmax-free attention, complemented by an extra batch normalization, facilitating simpler hardware design. The tailored hardware accommodates these diverse computing patterns by breaking them down into element-wise multiplication and accumulation (MAC). This is achieved through a 1-D processing array, utilizing configurable SRAM addressing, thereby minimizing hardware complexities and simplifying zero skipping. Using the TSMC 40nm CMOS process, the final implementation requires merely 207.8K gates and 53.75KB SRAM. It consumes only 8.08 mW for real-time inference at a 62.5MHz frequency.</p>

Achieved through algorithm and hardware co-optimizations, we propose a compact recurrent spiking neural network with two recurrent layers, one fully connected layer, and a low time step (1 or 2).

On the hardware front, we take advantage of \textit{mixed-level pruning}, \textit{zero-skipping} and \textit{merged spike} techniques, reducing complexity by 90.49\% to 13.86 MMAC/S. The \textit{parallel time-step execution} addresses inter-time-step data dependencies and enables weight buffer power savings through weight sharing. Capitalizing on the sparse spike activity, an input broadcasting scheme eliminates zero computations, further saving power. Implemented on the TSMC 28-nm process, the design operates in real time at 100 kHz, consuming 71.2 $\mu$W, surpassing state-of-the-art designs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruilin Wang, Xiang Feng, Huiqun Yu, Edmund M-K Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: In evolutionary multitasking, strategies such as crossover operators and skill factor assignment are critical for effective knowledge transfer. Existing improvements to crossover operators primarily focus on low-dimensional variable combinations, such as arithmetic crossover or partially mapped crossover, which are insufficient for modeling complex high-dimensional interactions.Moreover, static or semi-dynamic crossover strategies fail to adapt to the dynamic dependencies among tasks. In addition, current Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm frameworks often rely on fixed skill factor assignment strategies, lacking flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm-Residual Learning (MFEA-RL) method based on residual learning. The method employs a Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) model to generate high-dimensional residual representations of individuals, enhancing the modeling of complex relationships within dimensions. A ResNet-based mechanism dynamically assigns skill factors to improve task adaptability, while a random mapping mechanism efficiently performs crossover operations and mitigates the risk of negative transfer. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that MFEA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art multitasking algorithms. It excels in both convergence and adaptability on standard evolutionary multitasking benchmarks, including CEC2017-MTSO and WCCI2020-MTSO. Additionally, its effectiveness is validated through a real-world application scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moncef Garouani, Josiane Mothe, Ayah Barhrhouj, Julien Aligon</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning (ML) has led to the widespread adoption of complex "black box" models, such as deep neural networks and ensemble methods. These models exhibit exceptional predictive performance, making them invaluable for critical decision-making across diverse domains within society. However, their inherently opaque nature raises concerns about transparency and interpretability, making them untrustworthy decision support systems. To alleviate such a barrier to high-stakes adoption, research community focus has been on developing methods to explain black box models as a means to address the challenges they pose. Efforts are focused on explaining these models instead of developing ones that are inherently interpretable. Designing inherently interpretable models from the outset, however, can pave the path towards responsible and beneficial applications in the field of ML. In this position paper, we clarify the chasm between explaining black boxes and adopting inherently interpretable models. We emphasize the imperative need for model interpretability and, following the purpose of attaining better (i.e., more effective or efficient w.r.t. predictive performance) and trustworthy predictors, provide an experimental evaluation of latest hybrid learning methods that integrates symbolic knowledge into neural network predictors. We demonstrate how interpretable hybrid models could potentially supplant black box ones in different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohitash Chandra, Aryan Chaudhary, Yeshwanth Rayavarapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have been prominent for language translation, including low-resource languages. There has been limited study about the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT and Google Translate. In this study, we address this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations to English, and then we provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our findings suggest that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in figurative and philosophical contexts. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are better at preserving the sentiments for the Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit-English) translations when compared to Google Translate. We observed a similar trend for the case of Tamas (Hindi-English) and Maha P (Telugu-English) translations. GPT-4o performs similarly to GPT-3.5 in the translation in terms of sentiments for the three languages. We found that LLMs are generally better at translation for capturing sentiments when compared to Google Translate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Wu, Yixin Yang, Chengxiang Jin, Silu Mu, Xiaolei Qian, Jiajun Zhou, Shanqing Yu, Qi Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Ethereum, financial frauds such as Ponzi schemes have become increasingly rampant in the blockchain ecosystem, posing significant threats to the security of account assets. Existing Ethereum fraud detection methods typically model account transactions as graphs, but this approach primarily focuses on binary transactional relationships between accounts, failing to adequately capture the complex multi-party interaction patterns inherent in Ethereum. To address this, we propose a hypergraph modeling method for the Ponzi scheme detection method in Ethereum, called HyperDet. Specifically, we treat transaction hashes as hyperedges that connect all the relevant accounts involved in a transaction. Additionally, we design a two-step hypergraph sampling strategy to significantly reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-channel detection module, including the hypergraph detection channel and the hyper-homo graph detection channel, to be compatible with existing detection methods. Experimental results show that, compared to traditional homogeneous graph-based methods, the hyper-homo graph detection channel achieves significant performance improvements, demonstrating the superiority of hypergraph in Ponzi scheme detection. This research offers innovations for modeling complex relationships in blockchain data.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a metric called Number of Thoughts (NofT) to determine the difficulty of tasks pre-prompting and support Large Language Models (LLMs) in production contexts. By setting thresholds based on the number of thoughts, this metric can discern the difficulty of prompts and support more effective prompt routing. A 2% decrease in latency is achieved when routing prompts from the MathInstruct dataset through quantized, distilled versions of Deepseek with 1.7 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters. Moreover, this metric can be used to detect adversarial prompts used in prompt injection attacks with high efficacy. The Number of Thoughts can inform a classifier that achieves 95% accuracy in adversarial prompt detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deependra Singh, Saksham Agarwal, Subhankar Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Our research is motivated by the urgent global issue of a large population affected by retinal diseases, which are evenly distributed but underserved by specialized medical expertise, particularly in non-urban areas. Our primary objective is to bridge this healthcare gap by developing a comprehensive diagnostic system capable of accurately predicting retinal diseases solely from fundus images. However, we faced significant challenges due to limited, diverse datasets and imbalanced class distributions. To overcome these issues, we have devised innovative strategies. Our research introduces novel approaches, utilizing hybrid models combining deeper Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformer encoders, and ensemble architectures sequentially and in parallel to classify retinal fundus images into 20 disease labels. Our overarching goal is to assess these advanced models' potential in practical applications, with a strong focus on enhancing retinal disease diagnosis accuracy across a broader spectrum of conditions. Importantly, our efforts have surpassed baseline model results, with the C-Tran ensemble model emerging as the leader, achieving a remarkable model score of 0.9166, surpassing the baseline score of 0.9. Additionally, experiments with the IEViT model showcased equally promising outcomes with improved computational efficiency. We've also demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamic patch extraction and the integration of domain knowledge in computer vision tasks. In summary, our research strives to contribute significantly to retinal disease diagnosis, addressing the critical need for accessible healthcare solutions in underserved regions while aiming for comprehensive and accurate disease prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Budszuhn, Mark Joachim Krallmann, Daniel Horn</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of noisy multi-objective optimization lies in the constant trade-off between exploring new decision points and improving the precision of known points through resampling. This decision should take into account both the variability of the objective functions and the current estimate of a point in relation to the Pareto front. Since the amount and distribution of noise are generally unknown, it is desirable for a decision function to be highly adaptive to the properties of the optimization problem. This paper presents a resampling decision function that incorporates the stochastic nature of the optimization problem by using bootstrapping and the probability of dominance. The distribution-free estimation of the probability of dominance is achieved using bootstrap estimates of the means. To make the procedure applicable even with very few observations, we transfer the distribution observed at other decision points. The efficiency of this resampling approach is demonstrated by applying it in the NSGA-II algorithm with a sequential resampling procedure under multiple noise variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxue Hu, Junsong Li, Meixuan Chen, Dongyu Su, Tongguan Wang, Ying Sha</p>
<p>Abstract: Euphemism identification deciphers the true meaning of euphemisms, such as linking "weed" (euphemism) to "marijuana" (target keyword) in illicit texts, aiding content moderation and combating underground markets. While existing methods are primarily text-based, the rise of social media highlights the need for multimodal analysis, incorporating text, images, and audio. However, the lack of multimodal datasets for euphemisms limits further research. To address this, we regard euphemisms and their corresponding target keywords as keywords and first introduce a keyword-oriented multimodal corpus of euphemisms (KOM-Euph), involving three datasets (Drug, Weapon, and Sexuality), including text, images, and speech. We further propose a keyword-oriented multimodal euphemism identification method (KOM-EI), which uses cross-modal feature alignment and dynamic fusion modules to explicitly utilize the visual and audio features of the keywords for efficient euphemism identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KOM-EI outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models, and show the importance of our multimodal datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: To evaluate the performance of quantum computing systems relative to classical counterparts and explore the potential for quantum advantage, we propose a game-solving benchmark based on Elo ratings in the game of tic-tac-toe. We compare classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), and hybrid classical-quantum models by assessing their performance against a random-move agent in automated matches. Additionally, we implement a QCNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels. Our results show that the classical-quantum hybrid model achieves Elo ratings comparable to those of classical CNNs, while the standalone QCNN underperforms under current hardware constraints. The communication overhead was found to be modest. These findings demonstrate the viability of using game-based benchmarks for evaluating quantum computing systems and suggest that quantum communication can be incorporated with limited impact on performance, providing a foundation for future hybrid quantum applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matth\'eo Lecrivain, Hanifa Barry, Dalila Tamzalit, Houari Sahraoui</p>
<p>Abstract: The microservices architectural style has become the de facto standard for large-scale cloud applications, offering numerous benefits in scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. Many organizations are pursuing the migration of legacy monolithic systems to a microservices architecture. However, this process is challenging, risky, time-intensive, and prone-to-failure while several organizations lack necessary financial resources, time, or expertise to set up this migration process. So, rather than trying to migrate a legacy system where migration is risky or not feasible, we suggest exposing it as a microservice application without without having to migrate it. In this paper, we present a reusable, automated, two-phase approach that combines evolutionary algorithms with machine learning techniques. In the first phase, we identify microservices at the method level using a multi-objective genetic algorithm that considers both structural and semantic dependencies between methods. In the second phase, we generate REST APIs for each identified microservice using a classification algorithm to assign HTTP methods and endpoints. We evaluated our approach with a case study on the Spring PetClinic application, which has both monolithic and microservices implementations that serve as ground truth for comparison. Results demonstrate that our approach successfully aligns identified microservices with those in the reference microservices implementation, highlighting its effectiveness in service identification and API generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umer Butt, Stalin Veranasi, G\"unter Neumann</p>
<p>Abstract: As the Information Retrieval (IR) field increasingly recognizes the importance of inclusivity, addressing the needs of low-resource languages remains a significant challenge. Transliteration between Urdu and its Romanized form, Roman Urdu, remains underexplored despite the widespread use of both scripts in South Asia. Prior work using RNNs on the Roman-Urdu-Parl dataset showed promising results but suffered from poor domain adaptability and limited evaluation. We propose a transformer-based approach using the m2m100 multilingual translation model, enhanced with masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and fine-tuning on both Roman-Urdu-Parl and the domain-diverse Dakshina dataset. To address previous evaluation flaws, we introduce rigorous dataset splits and assess performance using BLEU, character-level BLEU, and CHRF. Our model achieves strong transliteration performance, with Char-BLEU scores of 96.37 for Urdu->Roman-Urdu and 97.44 for Roman-Urdu->Urdu. These results outperform both RNN baselines and GPT-4o Mini and demonstrate the effectiveness of multilingual transfer learning for low-resource transliteration tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Achint Soni, Meet Soni, Sirisha Rambhatla</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image editing aims to modify specific regions of an image according to natural language instructions while maintaining the general structure and the background fidelity. Existing methods utilize masks derived from cross-attention maps generated from diffusion models to identify the target regions for modification. However, since cross-attention mechanisms focus on semantic relevance, they struggle to maintain the image integrity. As a result, these methods often lack spatial consistency, leading to editing artifacts and distortions. In this work, we address these limitations and introduce LOCATEdit, which enhances cross-attention maps through a graph-based approach utilizing self-attention-derived patch relationships to maintain smooth, coherent attention across image regions, ensuring that alterations are limited to the designated items while retaining the surrounding structure. \method consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on PIE-Bench, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness on various editing tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuwei Yin, EunJeong Hwang, Giuseppe Carenini</p>
<p>Abstract: Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaofeng Zhou, Rui-Feng Wang, Kangning Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Community detection, which identifies densely connected node clusters with sparse between-group links, is vital for analyzing network structure and function in real-world systems. Most existing community detection methods based on GCNs primarily focus on node-level information while overlooking community-level features, leading to performance limitations on large-scale networks. To address this issue, we propose LQ-GCN, an overlapping community detection model from a local community perspective. LQ-GCN employs a Bernoulli-Poisson model to construct a community affiliation matrix and form an end-to-end detection framework. By adopting local modularity as the objective function, the model incorporates local community information to enhance the quality and accuracy of clustering results. Additionally, the conventional GCNs architecture is optimized to improve the model capability in identifying overlapping communities in large-scale networks. Experimental results demonstrate that LQ-GCN achieves up to a 33% improvement in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and a 26.3% improvement in Recall compared to baseline models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alimjan Mattursun, Liejun Wang, Yinfeng Yu, Chunyang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech self-supervised learning (SSL) has made great progress in various speech processing tasks, but there is still room for improvement in speech enhancement (SE). This paper presents BSP-MPNet, a dual-path framework that combines self-supervised features with magnitude-phase information for SE. The approach starts by applying the perceptual contrast stretching (PCS) algorithm to enhance the magnitude-phase spectrum. A magnitude-phase 2D coarse (MP-2DC) encoder then extracts coarse features from the enhanced spectrum. Next, a feature-separating self-supervised learning (FS-SSL) model generates self-supervised embeddings for the magnitude and phase components separately. These embeddings are fused to create cross-domain feature representations. Finally, two parallel RNN-enhanced multi-attention (REMA) mask decoders refine the features, apply them to the mask, and reconstruct the speech signal. We evaluate BSP-MPNet on the VoiceBank+DEMAND and WHAMR! datasets. Experimental results show that BSP-MPNet outperforms existing methods under various noise conditions, providing new directions for self-supervised speech enhancement research. The implementation of the BSP-MPNet code is available online\footnote[2]{https://github.com/AlimMat/BSP-MPNet. \label{s1}}</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate camera calibration is a fundamental task for 3D perception, especially when dealing with real-world, in-the-wild environments where complex optical distortions are common. Existing methods often rely on pre-rectified images or calibration patterns, which limits their applicability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by jointly modeling camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using a generic ray camera model. Unlike previous approaches, AlignDiff shifts focus from semantic to geometric features, enabling more accurate modeling of local distortions. We propose AlignDiff, a diffusion model conditioned on geometric priors, enabling the simultaneous estimation of camera distortions and scene geometry. To enhance distortion prediction, we incorporate edge-aware attention, focusing the model on geometric features around image edges, rather than semantic content. Furthermore, to enhance generalizability to real-world captures, we incorporate a large database of ray-traced lenses containing over three thousand samples. This database characterizes the distortion inherent in a diverse variety of lens forms. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the angular error of estimated ray bundles by ~8.2 degrees and overall calibration accuracy, outperforming existing approaches on challenging, real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discrete Diffusion and Flow Matching models have significantly advanced generative modeling for discrete structures, including graphs. However, the time dependencies in the noising process of these models lead to error accumulation and propagation during the backward process. This issue, particularly pronounced in mask diffusion, is a known limitation in sequence modeling and, as we demonstrate, also impacts discrete diffusion models for graphs.
  To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Iterative Denoising, which simplifies discrete diffusion and circumvents the issue by assuming conditional independence across time. Additionally, we enhance our model by incorporating a Critic, which during generation selectively retains or corrupts elements in an instance based on their likelihood under the data distribution. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines in graph generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed task automation and content generation across various domains while incorporating safety filters to prevent misuse. We introduce a novel jailbreaking framework that employs distributed prompt processing combined with iterative refinements to bypass these safety measures, particularly in generating malicious code. Our architecture consists of four key modules: prompt segmentation, parallel processing, response aggregation, and LLM-based jury evaluation. Tested on 500 malicious prompts across 10 cybersecurity categories, the framework achieves a 73.2% Success Rate (SR) in generating malicious code. Notably, our comparative analysis reveals that traditional single-LLM judge evaluation overestimates SRs (93.8%) compared to our LLM jury system (73.2%), with manual verification confirming that single-judge assessments often accept incomplete implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our distributed architecture improves SRs by 12% over the non-distributed approach in an ablation study, highlighting both the effectiveness of distributed prompt processing and the importance of robust evaluation methodologies in assessing jailbreak attempts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human. State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring non-trivial prompt engineering).
  In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic research investigations in future.</p>

Manazel (The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/lairgiyassir/manazel) addresses this challenge in Morocco by leveraging 13 years of crescent visibility data to refine the ODEH criterion, a widely used standard for lunar crescent visibility prediction. The study integrates two key features, the Arc of Vision (ARCV) and the total width of the crescent (W), to enhance the accuracy of lunar visibility assessments. A machine learning approach utilizing the Logistic Regression algorithm is employed to classify crescent visibility conditions, achieving a predictive accuracy of 98.83%. This data-driven methodology offers a robust and reliable framework for determining the start of the Hijri month, comparing different data classification tools, and improving the consistency of lunar calendar calculations in Morocco.

In this paper, we introduce Model Assembly Learning (MAL), a novel paradigm for model merging that iteratively integrates parameters from diverse models in an open-ended model zoo to enhance the base model's capabilities. Unlike previous works that require identical architectures, MAL allows the merging of heterogeneous architectures and selective parameters across layers. Specifically, the base model can incorporate parameters from different layers of multiple pre-trained models. We systematically investigate the conditions and fundamental settings of heterogeneous parameter merging, addressing all possible mismatches in layer widths between the base and target models. Furthermore, we establish key laws and provide practical guidelines for effectively implementing MAL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajvee Sheth, Himanshu Beniwal, Mayank Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of digital communication has driven the widespread use of code-mixing, particularly Hindi-English, in multilingual communities. Existing datasets often focus on romanized text, have limited scope, or rely on synthetic data, which fails to capture realworld language nuances. Human annotations are crucial for assessing the naturalness and acceptability of code-mixed text. To address these challenges, We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the largest manually annotated dataset for code-mixed text, comprising 100,970 instances evaluated by three expert annotators in both Devanagari and Roman scripts. The dataset supports five fundamental NLP tasks: Language Identification, Matrix Language Identification, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Translation. We evaluate LLMs on these tasks using COMILINGUA, revealing limitations in current multilingual modeling strategies and emphasizing the need for improved code-mixed text processing capabilities. COMI-LINGUA is publically availabe at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LingoIITGN/COMI-LINGUA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satvik Verma, Qun Wang, E. Wes Bethel</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly with the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques often fall short in detecting such attacks due to the complexity of blended and evolving patterns. To address this, we propose a novel framework leveraging On-Device Large Language Models (ODLLMs) augmented with fine-tuning and knowledge base (KB) integration for intelligent IoT network attack detection. By implementing feature ranking techniques and constructing both long and short KBs tailored to model capacities, the proposed framework ensures efficient and accurate detection of DDoS attacks while overcoming computational and privacy limitations. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized framework achieves superior accuracy across diverse attack types, especially when using compact models in edge computing environments. This work provides a scalable and secure solution for real-time IoT security, advancing the applicability of edge intelligence in cybersecurity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Ma, Xinyue Liang, Rongyuan Wu, Xiangyu Zhu, Zhen Lei, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: It is highly desirable to obtain a model that can generate high-quality 3D meshes from text prompts in just seconds. While recent attempts have adapted pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into generators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor quality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at overcoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D ground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a native 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to progressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each step it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion models, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill text-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score distillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can easily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for challenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate the inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we train a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\%$ trainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo outperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality. Specifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and generalize well for challenging text input. The code is available at https://github.com/theEricMa/TriplaneTurbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahe Qian, Yaoyu Fang, Jinkui Hao, Bo Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cell nuclei in histopathology images is essential for numerous biomedical research and clinical applications. However, existing cell nucleus segmentation methods only consider a single dataset (i.e., primary domain), while neglecting to leverage supplementary data from diverse sources (i.e., auxiliary domains) to reduce overfitting and enhance the performance. Although incorporating multiple datasets could alleviate overfitting, it often exacerbates performance drops caused by domain shifts. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Multi-domain Alignment of Segment Anything Model (AMA-SAM) that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to overcome these obstacles through two key innovations. First, we propose a Conditional Gradient Reversal Layer (CGRL), a multi-domain alignment module that harmonizes features from diverse domains to promote domain-invariant representation learning while preserving crucial discriminative features for the primary dataset. Second, we address SAM's inherent low-resolution output by designing a High-Resolution Decoder (HR-Decoder), which directly produces fine-grained segmentation maps in order to capture intricate nuclei boundaries in high-resolution histology images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt SAM for multi-dataset learning with application to histology nuclei segmentation. We validate our method on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Frontier models have either been language-only or have primarily focused on vision and language modalities. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework for thoroughly assessing their cross-modality perception performance. We introduce MAVERIX~(Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation Reasoning IndeX), a novel benchmark with 700 videos and 2,556 questions explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through tasks that necessitate close integration of video and audio information. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual tasks, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and o1, show performance approaching human levels (around 70% accuracy), while human experts reach near-ceiling performance (95.1%). With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study last-layer outlier dimensions, i.e.dimensions that display extreme activations for the majority of inputs. We show that outlier dimensions arise in many different modern language models, and trace their function back to the heuristic of constantly predicting frequent words. We further show how a model can block this heuristic when it is not contextually appropriate, by assigning a counterbalancing weight mass to the remaining dimensions, and we investigate which model parameters boost outlier dimensions and when they arise during training. We conclude that outlier dimensions are a specialized mechanism discovered by many distinct models to implement a useful token prediction heuristic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy deployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and broader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which is computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a mechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However, single-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due to the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the test-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of agent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned LLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture of agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for inference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among multiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen from a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This policy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step, enabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance with respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given off-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with open-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates the merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably, Collab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement of up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Lee, Shulin Cao, Jinxin Liu, Jiajie Zhang, Weichuan Liu, Xiaoyin Che, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities but rely primarily on parametric knowledge, limiting factual accuracy. While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee, Shuai Wang, Yinan Yu, Robert Feldt, Dhasarathy Parthasarathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Didolkar, Andrii Zadaianchuk, Rabiul Awal, Maximilian Seitzer, Efstratios Gavves, Aishwarya Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric representation learning aims to decompose visual scenes into fixed-size vectors called "slots" or "object files", where each slot captures a distinct object. Current state-of-the-art object-centric models have shown remarkable success in object discovery in diverse domains, including complex real-world scenes. However, these models suffer from a key limitation: they lack controllability. Specifically, current object-centric models learn representations based on their preconceived understanding of objects, without allowing user input to guide which objects are represented. Introducing controllability into object-centric models could unlock a range of useful capabilities, such as the ability to extract instance-specific representations from a scene. In this work, we propose a novel approach for user-directed control over slot representations by conditioning slots on language descriptions. The proposed ConTRoLlable Object-centric representation learning approach, which we term CTRL-O, achieves targeted object-language binding in complex real-world scenes without requiring mask supervision. Next, we apply these controllable slot representations on two downstream vision language tasks: text-to-image generation and visual question answering. The proposed approach enables instance-specific text-to-image generation and also achieves strong performance on visual question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Bulat, Yassine Ouali, Georgios Tzimiropoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study. Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</p>

Current dominant functional map methods, while effective in controlled scenarios, struggle in real situations with more complex challenges such as non-isometric shape discrepancies. In response, we revisit registration-for-correspondence methods and tap their potential for more stable shape correspondence estimation. To overcome their common issues including unstable deformations and the necessity for careful pre-alignment or high-quality initial 3D correspondences, we introduce Stable-SCore: A Stable Registration-based Framework for 3D Shape Correspondence. We first re-purpose a foundation model for 2D character correspondence that ensures reliable and stable 2D mappings. Crucially, we propose a novel Semantic Flow Guided Registration approach that leverages 2D correspondence to guide mesh deformations. Our framework significantly surpasses existing methods in challenging scenarios, and brings possibilities for a wide array of real applications, as demonstrated in our results.</p>

To achieve this, we introduce a style-content cross fusion mechanism and align a style encoder with a pre-trained multi-modal model, ensuring that the generated motion accurately captures the reference style while preserving realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework surpasses existing methods in stylized motion generation and exhibits emergent capabilities for multi-modal motion stylization, enabling more nuanced motion synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moran Barenboim, Vadim Indelman</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is a critical aspect of many practical autonomous systems due to incomplete information. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a mathematically principled framework for formulating decision-making problems under such conditions. However, finding an optimal solution for a POMDP is generally intractable. In recent years, there has been a significant progress of scaling approximate solvers from small to moderately sized problems, using online tree search solvers. Often, such approximate solvers are limited to probabilistic or asymptotic guarantees towards the optimal solution. In this paper, we derive a deterministic relationship for discrete POMDPs between an approximated and the optimal solution. We show that at any time, we can derive bounds that relate between the existing solution and the optimal one. We show that our derivations provide an avenue for a new set of algorithms and can be attached to existing algorithms that have a certain structure to provide them with deterministic guarantees with marginal computational overhead. In return, not only do we certify the solution quality, but we demonstrate that making a decision based on the deterministic guarantee may result in superior performance compared to the original algorithm without the deterministic certification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Kazemi, Jessica Lally, Ekaterina Tishchenko, Hana Chockler, Nicola Paoletti</p>
<p>Abstract: Our work addresses a fundamental problem in the context of counterfactual inference for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Given an MDP path $\tau$, this kind of inference allows us to derive counterfactual paths $\tau'$ describing what-if versions of $\tau$ obtained under different action sequences than those observed in $\tau$. However, as the counterfactual states and actions deviate from the observed ones over time, the observation $\tau$ may no longer influence the counterfactual world, meaning that the analysis is no longer tailored to the individual observation, resulting in interventional outcomes rather than counterfactual ones. Even though this issue specifically affects the popular Gumbel-max structural causal model used for MDP counterfactuals, it has remained overlooked until now. In this work, we introduce a formal characterisation of influence based on comparing counterfactual and interventional distributions. We devise an algorithm to construct counterfactual models that automatically satisfy influence constraints. Leveraging such models, we derive counterfactual policies that are not just optimal for a given reward structure but also remain tailored to the observed path. Even though there is an unavoidable trade-off between policy optimality and strength of influence constraints, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to derive (near-)optimal policies while remaining under the influence of the observation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuetai Li, Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Dinuka Sahabandu, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Radha Poovendran</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in generation tasks has enabled practitioners to leverage publicly available models to power custom applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. However, the data used to train or fine-tune these LLMs is often undisclosed, allowing an attacker to compromise the data and inject backdoors into the models. In this paper, we develop a novel inference time defense, named CLEANGEN, to mitigate backdoor attacks for generation tasks in LLMs. CLEANGEN is a lightweight and effective decoding strategy that is compatible with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Our insight behind CLEANGEN is that compared to other LLMs, backdoored LLMs assign significantly higher probabilities to tokens representing the attacker-desired contents. These discrepancies in token probabilities enable CLEANGEN to identify suspicious tokens favored by the attacker and replace them with tokens generated by another LLM that is not compromised by the same attacker, thereby avoiding generation of attacker-desired content. We evaluate CLEANGEN against five SOTA backdoor attacks. Our results show that CLEANGEN achieves lower attack success rates (ASR) compared to five SOTA baseline defenses for all five backdoor attacks. Moreover, LLMs deploying CLEANGEN maintain helpfulness in their responses when serving benign user queries with minimal added computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-play, characterized by agents' interactions with copies or past versions of themselves, has recently gained prominence in reinforcement learning (RL). This paper first clarifies the preliminaries of self-play, including the multi-agent reinforcement learning framework and basic game theory concepts. Then, it provides a unified framework and classifies existing self-play algorithms within this framework. Moreover, the paper bridges the gap between the algorithms and their practical implications by illustrating the role of self-play in different scenarios. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future research directions in self-play. This paper is an essential guide map for understanding the multifaceted landscape of self-play in RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunji Kim, Siwon Kim, Minjun Park, Rahim Entezari, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, show significant demographic biases. Existing de-biasing techniques rely heavily on additional training, which imposes high computational costs and risks of compromising core image generation functionality. This hinders them from being widely adopted to real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Stable Diffusion's overlooked potential to reduce bias without requiring additional training. Through our analysis, we uncover that initial noises associated with minority attributes form "minority regions" rather than scattered. We view these "minority regions" as opportunities in SD to reduce bias. To unlock the potential, we propose a novel de-biasing method called 'weak guidance,' carefully designed to guide a random noise to the minority regions without compromising semantic integrity. Through analysis and experiments on various versions of SD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces bias without additional training, achieving both efficiency and preservation of core image generation functionality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhang, Srishti Yadav, Fengze Han, Ekaterina Shutova</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muchao Ye, Weiyang Liu, Pan He</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Lally, Milad Kazemi, Nicola Paoletti</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses a key limitation in existing counterfactual inference methods for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Current approaches assume a specific causal model to make counterfactuals identifiable. However, there are usually many causal models that align with the observational and interventional distributions of an MDP, each yielding different counterfactual distributions, so fixing a particular causal model limits the validity (and usefulness) of counterfactual inference. We propose a novel non-parametric approach that computes tight bounds on counterfactual transition probabilities across all compatible causal models. Unlike previous methods that require solving prohibitively large optimisation problems (with variables that grow exponentially in the size of the MDP), our approach provides closed-form expressions for these bounds, making computation highly efficient and scalable for non-trivial MDPs. Once such an interval counterfactual MDP is constructed, our method identifies robust counterfactual policies that optimise the worst-case reward w.r.t. the uncertain interval MDP probabilities. We evaluate our method on various case studies, demonstrating improved robustness over existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Yuan, Vinkle Srivastav, Tong Yu, Joel L. Lavanchy, Jacques Marescaux, Pietro Mascagni, Nassir Navab, Nicolas Padoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in surgical computer vision applications have been driven by vision-only models, which do not explicitly integrate the rich semantics of language into their design. These methods rely on manually annotated surgical videos to predict a fixed set of object categories, limiting their generalizability to unseen surgical procedures and downstream tasks. In this work, we put forward the idea that the surgical video lectures available through open surgical e-learning platforms can provide effective vision and language supervisory signals for multi-modal representation learning without relying on manual annotations. We address the surgery-specific linguistic challenges present in surgical video lectures by employing multiple complementary automatic speech recognition systems to generate text transcriptions. We then present a novel method, SurgVLP - Surgical Vision Language Pre-training, for multi-modal representation learning. Extensive experiments across diverse surgical procedures and tasks demonstrate that the multi-modal representations learned by SurgVLP exhibit strong transferability and adaptability in surgical video analysis. Furthermore, our zero-shot evaluations highlight SurgVLP's potential as a general-purpose foundation model for surgical workflow analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotations for downstream tasks, and facilitating adaptation methods such as few-shot learning to build a scalable and data-efficient solution for various downstream surgical applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Monan Zhou, Shangda Wu, Shaohua Ji, Zijin Li, Wei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to develop a holistic evaluation method for piano sound quality to assist in purchasing decisions. Unlike previous studies that focused on the effect of piano performance techniques on sound quality, this study evaluates the inherent sound quality of different pianos. To derive quality evaluation systems, the study uses subjective questionnaires based on a piano sound quality dataset. The method selects the optimal piano classification models by comparing the fine-tuning results of different pre-training models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To improve the interpretability of the models, the study applies Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) analysis. The results reveal that musically trained individuals are better able to distinguish between the sound quality differences of different pianos. The best fine-tuned CNN pre-trained backbone achieves a high accuracy of 98.3% as the piano classifier. However, the dataset is limited, and the audio is sliced to increase its quantity, resulting in a lack of diversity and balance, so we use focal loss to reduce the impact of data imbalance. To optimize the method, the dataset will be expanded, or few-shot learning techniques will be employed in future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Wenjie Qiu, Yi-Chen Li, Lei Yuan, Chengxing Jia, Zongzhang Zhang, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing policies that can adjust to non-stationary environments is essential for real-world reinforcement learning applications. However, learning such adaptable policies in offline settings, with only a limited set of pre-collected trajectories, presents significant challenges. A key difficulty arises because the limited offline data makes it hard for the context encoder to differentiate between changes in the environment dynamics and shifts in the behavior policy, often leading to context misassociations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach called Debiased Offline Representation for fast online Adaptation (DORA). DORA incorporates an information bottleneck principle that maximizes mutual information between the dynamics encoding and the environmental data, while minimizing mutual information between the dynamics encoding and the actions of the behavior policy. We present a practical implementation of DORA, leveraging tractable bounds of the information bottleneck principle. Our experimental evaluation across six benchmark MuJoCo tasks with variable parameters demonstrates that DORA not only achieves a more precise dynamics encoding but also significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce methods for discovering and applying sparse feature circuits. These are causally implicated subnetworks of human-interpretable features for explaining language model behaviors. Circuits identified in prior work consist of polysemantic and difficult-to-interpret units like attention heads or neurons, rendering them unsuitable for many downstream applications. In contrast, sparse feature circuits enable detailed understanding of unanticipated mechanisms. Because they are based on fine-grained units, sparse feature circuits are useful for downstream tasks: We introduce SHIFT, where we improve the generalization of a classifier by ablating features that a human judges to be task-irrelevant. Finally, we demonstrate an entirely unsupervised and scalable interpretability pipeline by discovering thousands of sparse feature circuits for automatically discovered model behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhong Min, Shyamal Buch, Arsha Nagrani, Minsu Cho, Cordelia Schmid</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of video question answering (videoQA) via a decomposed multi-stage, modular reasoning framework. Previous modular methods have shown promise with a single planning stage ungrounded in visual content. However, through a simple and effective baseline, we find that such systems can lead to brittle behavior in practice for challenging videoQA settings. Thus, unlike traditional single-stage planning methods, we propose a multi-stage system consisting of an event parser, a grounding stage, and a final reasoning stage in conjunction with an external memory. All stages are training-free, and performed using few-shot prompting of large models, creating interpretable intermediate outputs at each stage. By decomposing the underlying planning and task complexity, our method, MoReVQA, improves over prior work on standard videoQA benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, EgoSchema, ActivityNet-QA) with state-of-the-art results, and extensions to related tasks (grounded videoQA, paragraph captioning).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihuang Zhong, Kang Wang, Ziyang Xu, Juhua Liu, Liang Ding, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various reasoning tasks. However, CoT still falls short in dealing with complex math word problems, as it usually suffers from three pitfalls: semantic misunderstanding errors, calculation errors, and step-missing errors. Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the reasoning performance of LLMs. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse reasoning benchmarks show that our DUP method consistently outperforms the other counterparts by a large margin. More encouragingly, DUP achieves a new SOTA result on the GSM8K benchmark, with an accuracy of 97.1% under the zero-shot setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like generalization, interpretability, and inter-operability with human users. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the high-level strategies underlying rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a *rule generation* step guided by language models, and an *update* step where agents learn new policies guided by rules, even when a rule is insufficient to describe an entire complex policy. Across five diverse tasks, including a two-player signaling game, maze navigation, image reconstruction, and robot grasp planning, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination.

<p>Abstract: Social robot navigation in crowded public spaces such as university campuses, restaurants, grocery stores, and hospitals, is an increasingly important area of research. One of the core strategies for achieving this goal is to understand humans' intent--underlying psychological factors that govern their motion--by learning their reward functions, typically via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Despite significant progress in IRL, learning reward functions of multiple agents simultaneously in dense unstructured pedestrian crowds has remained intractable due to the nature of the tightly coupled social interactions that occur in these scenarios \textit{e.g.} passing, intersections, swerving, weaving, etc. In this paper, we present a new multi-agent maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for real world unstructured pedestrian crowds. Key to our approach is a simple, but effective, mathematical trick which we name the so-called tractability-rationality trade-off trick that achieves tractability at the cost of a slight reduction in accuracy. We compare our approach to the classical single-agent MaxEnt IRL as well as state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on several datasets including the ETH, UCY, SCAND, JRDB, and a new dataset, called Speedway, collected at a busy intersection on a University campus focusing on dense, complex agent interactions. Our key findings show that, on the dense Speedway dataset, our approach ranks 1st among top 7 baselines with >2X improvement over single-agent IRL, and is competitive with state-of-the-art large transformer-based encoder-decoder models on sparser datasets such as ETH/UCY (ranks 3rd among top 7 baselines).</p>

<p>Abstract: Video editing serves as a fundamental pillar of digital media, spanning applications in entertainment, education, and professional communication. However, previous methods often overlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local contexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistent edits in the spatiotemporal dimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a unified spatiotemporal Video Adaptation framework for global and local video editing, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First, to ensure local consistency within individual frames, we designed test-time editing adaptation to adapt a pre-trained image editing model for improving consistency between potential editing directions and the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local control. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence, we introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that recursively gather consistent attention variables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole sequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are more faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal context, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potential for advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene expression data. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide range of gene identification problems, encompassing dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTex.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Blot (LISN, CNRS), Anastasios N Angelopoulos (UC Berkeley), Michael I Jordan (UC Berkeley, Inria), Nicolas J-B Brunel (ENSIIE)</p>
<p>Abstract: Science and technology have a growing need for effective mechanisms that ensure reliable, controlled performance from black-box machine learning algorithms. These performance guarantees should ideally hold conditionally on the input-that is the performance guarantees should hold, at least approximately, no matter what the input. However, beyond stylized discrete groupings such as ethnicity and gender, the right notion of conditioning can be difficult to define. For example, in problems such as image segmentation, we want the uncertainty to reflect the intrinsic difficulty of the test sample, but this may be difficult to capture via a conditioning event. Building on the recent work of Gibbs et al. [2023], we propose a methodology for achieving approximate conditional control of statistical risks-the expected value of loss functions-by adapting to the difficulty of test samples. Our framework goes beyond traditional conditional risk control based on user-provided conditioning events to the algorithmic, data-driven determination of appropriate function classes for conditioning. We apply this framework to various regression and segmentation tasks, enabling finer-grained control over model performance and demonstrating that by continuously monitoring and adjusting these parameters, we can achieve superior precision compared to conventional risk-control methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Chen, Dongshu Liu, Jeremie Laydevant, Julie Grollier</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents that operate autonomously benefit from lifelong learning capabilities. However, compatible training algorithms must comply with the decentralized nature of these systems, which imposes constraints on both the parameter counts and the computational resources. The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is one of these. FF relies only on feedforward operations, the same used for inference, for optimizing layer-wise objectives. This purely forward approach eliminates the need for transpose operations required in traditional backpropagation. Despite its potential, FF has failed to reach state-of-the-art performance on most standard benchmark tasks, in part due to unreliable negative data generation methods for unsupervised learning.
  In this work, we propose the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) algorithm, a competitive training method aimed at closing this performance gap. Inspired by standard self-supervised contrastive learning for vision tasks, SCFF generates positive and negative inputs applicable across various datasets. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing unsupervised local learning algorithms on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet. We extend FF's application to training recurrent neural networks, expanding its utility to sequential data tasks. These findings pave the way for high-accuracy, real-time learning on resource-constrained edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhe Wu, Yipeng Xu, Tianyu Xu, Jialu Zhang, Jianfeng Ren, Xudong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-Free Counting aims to count objects of interest without intensive annotations of objects or exemplars. To achieve this, we propose a Gated Context-Aware Swin-UNet (GCA-SUNet) to directly map an input image to the density map of countable objects. Specifically, a set of Swin transformers form an encoder to derive a robust feature representation, and a Gated Context-Aware Modulation block is designed to suppress irrelevant objects or background through a gate mechanism and exploit the attentive support of objects of interest through a self-similarity matrix. The gate strategy is also incorporated into the bottleneck network and the decoder of the Swin-UNet to highlight the features most relevant to objects of interest. By explicitly exploiting the attentive support among countable objects and eliminating irrelevant features through the gate mechanisms, the proposed GCA-SUNet focuses on and counts objects of interest without relying on predefined categories or exemplars. Experimental results on the real-world datasets such as FSC-147 and CARPK demonstrate that GCA-SUNet significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have focused on integrating multiple modalities, yet their ability to simultaneously process and reason across different inputs remains underexplored. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define language models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench features high-quality human annotations that require integrated understanding across all modalities. Our evaluation reveals that: i) open-source OLMs show significant limitations in instruction-following and reasoning in tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baseline models perform poorly (around 50% accuracy) even with textual alternatives to image/audio inputs. To address these limitations, we develop OmniInstruct, an 96K-sample instruction tuning dataset for training OLMs. We advocate for developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance. Codes and data could be found at our repo (https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/OmniBench).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexi Du, John Onofrey, Nicha C. Dvornek</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) demonstrates strong potential in medical image analysis but requires substantial data and computational resources. Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities underexplored. Here, we propose one of the first adaptations of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and class-wise imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations. Our multi-view and multi-scale alignment (MaMA) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for three different tasks on two large real-world mammography datasets, EMBED and RSNA-Mammo, with only 52% model size compared with the largest baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingqi Zhou, Sheng Wang, Jingwei Dong, Lei Li, Jiahui Gao, Jiyue Jiang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited multi-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing multi-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the assistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15% on MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Sun, Xulong Zhang, Monan Zhou, Wei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Music emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify the emotions conveyed in a given musical piece. However, currently, in the field of MER, the available public datasets have limited sample sizes. Recently, segment-based methods for emotion-related tasks have been proposed, which train backbone networks on shorter segments instead of entire audio clips, thereby naturally augmenting training samples without requiring additional resources. Then, the predicted segment-level results are aggregated to obtain the entire song prediction. The most commonly used method is that the segment inherits the label of the clip containing it, but music emotion is not constant during the whole clip. Doing so will introduce label noise and make the training easy to overfit. To handle the noisy label issue, we propose a semi-supervised self-learning (SSSL) method, which can differentiate between samples with correct and incorrect labels in a self-learning manner, thus effectively utilizing the augmented segment-level data. Experiments on three public emotional datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better or comparable performance.</p>

However, their performance in multivariate long-term forecasting often falls short compared to simpler linear baselines. Previous research has identified the traditional attention mechanism as a key factor limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce LATST, a novel approach designed to mitigate entropy collapse and training instability common challenges in Transformer-based time series forecasting. We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Zhou, Daniele Solombrino, Donato Crisostomi, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Fabrizio Silvestri, Emanuele Rodol\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has recently emerged as a cost-efficient paradigm for multi-task learning. Among current approaches, task arithmetic stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this paper, we motivate the effectiveness of task vectors by linking them to multi-task gradients. We show that in a single-epoch scenario, if the optimization is performed via gradient descent, task vectors are after one step mathematically equivalent to the gradients obtained via gradient descent in a multi-task setting, and still approximate these gradients in subsequent epochs. Furthermore, we show that the effectiveness of task vectors is largely driven by the first epoch's gradient. Given this parallel between task vectors and gradients, we propose viewing model merging as a single step in an iterative process that alternates between tuning and merging (ATM). We then propose two ways to utilize ATM. The first is to replace multi-task learning with ATM in scenarios where data sharing is prohibited, such as federated learning. The second is to improve the outcome of any model merging algorithm by applying a few post-hoc iterations of ATM on a small validation dataset, which is commonly available for hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we provide both empirical and theoretical support for the effectiveness of ATM, demonstrating that it minimizes an upper bound on the loss obtained by jointly finetuning all tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boming Xia, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu, Zhenchang Xing, Dehai Zhao, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of LLM agents: autonomous systems capable of achieving under-specified goals and adapting post-deployment, often without explicit code or model changes. Evaluating these agents is critical to ensuring their performance and safety, especially given their dynamic, probabilistic, and evolving nature. However, traditional approaches such as predefined test cases and standard redevelopment pipelines struggle to address the unique challenges of LLM agent evaluation. These challenges include capturing open-ended behaviors, handling emergent outcomes, and enabling continuous adaptation over the agent's lifecycle. To address these issues, we propose an evaluation-driven development approach, inspired by test-driven and behavior-driven development but reimagined for the unique characteristics of LLM agents. Through a multivocal literature review (MLR), we synthesize the limitations of existing LLM evaluation methods and introduce a novel process model and reference architecture tailored for evaluation-driven development of LLM agents. Our approach integrates online (runtime) and offline (redevelopment) evaluations, enabling adaptive runtime adjustments and systematic iterative refinement of pipelines, artifacts, system architecture, and LLMs themselves. By continuously incorporating evaluation results, including fine-grained feedback from human and AI evaluators, into each stage of development and operation, this framework ensures that LLM agents remain aligned with evolving goals, user needs, and governance standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhening Liu, Yingdong Hu, Xinjie Zhang, Rui Song, Jiawei Shao, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has led to great interest in 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Existing approaches mainly rely on full-length multi-view videos, while there has been limited exploration of online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-timestep streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features as well as neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage to distinguish dynamic and static primitives and optimize their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 4D reconstruction, demonstrating the fastest on-the-fly training, superior representation quality, and real-time rendering capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caixin Kang, Yubo Chen, Shouwei Ruan, Shiji Zhao, Ruochen Zhang, Jiayi Wang, Shan Fu, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of deep learning, facial recognition technology has seen extensive research and rapid development. Although facial recognition is considered a mature technology, we find that existing open-source models and commercial algorithms lack robustness in certain complex Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, raising concerns about the reliability of these systems. In this paper, we introduce OODFace, which explores the OOD challenges faced by facial recognition models from two perspectives: common corruptions and appearance variations. We systematically design 30 OOD scenarios across 9 major categories tailored for facial recognition. By simulating these challenges on public datasets, we establish three robustness benchmarks: LFW-C/V, CFP-FP-C/V, and YTF-C/V. We then conduct extensive experiments on 19 facial recognition models and 3 commercial APIs, along with extended physical experiments on face masks to assess their robustness. Next, we explore potential solutions from two perspectives: defense strategies and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Based on the results, we draw several key insights, highlighting the vulnerability of facial recognition systems to OOD data and suggesting possible solutions. Additionally, we offer a unified toolkit that includes all corruption and variation types, easily extendable to other datasets. We hope that our benchmarks and findings can provide guidance for future improvements in facial recognition model robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, is a prominent research area that aims to generate natural-sounding human speech from text. Recently, with the increasing industrial demand, TTS technologies have evolved beyond synthesizing human-like speech to enabling controllable speech generation. This includes fine-grained control over various attributes of synthesized speech such as emotion, prosody, timbre, and duration. In addition, advancements in deep learning, such as diffusion and large language models, have significantly enhanced controllable TTS over the past several years. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive survey of controllable TTS, covering approaches ranging from basic control techniques to methods utilizing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the current state of research. We examine the general controllable TTS pipeline, challenges, model architectures, and control strategies, offering a comprehensive and clear taxonomy of existing methods. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of datasets and evaluation metrics and shed some light on the applications and future directions of controllable TTS. To the best of our knowledge, this survey paper provides the first comprehensive review of emerging controllable TTS methods, which can serve as a beneficial resource for both academic researchers and industrial practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxing Lu, Tengbo Yu, Haoyuan Deng, Season Si Chen, Yansong Tang, Ziwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Performing general language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks is of great importance for many applications ranging from household service to industrial assembly. However, collecting bimanual manipulation data is expensive due to the high-dimensional action space, which poses challenges for conventional methods to handle general bimanual manipulation tasks. In contrast, unimanual policy has recently demonstrated impressive generalizability across a wide range of tasks because of scaled model parameters and training data, which can provide sharable manipulation knowledge for bimanual systems. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play method named AnyBimanual, which transfers pre-trained unimanual policy to general bimanual manipulation policy with few bimanual demonstrations. Specifically, we first introduce a skill manager to dynamically schedule the skill representations discovered from pre-trained unimanual policy for bimanual manipulation tasks, which linearly combines skill primitives with task-oriented compensation to represent the bimanual manipulation instruction. To mitigate the observation discrepancy between unimanual and bimanual systems, we present a visual aligner to generate soft masks for visual embedding of the workspace, which aims to align visual input of unimanual policy model for each arm with those during pretraining stage. AnyBimanual shows superiority on 12 simulated tasks from RLBench2 with a sizable 12.67% improvement in success rate over previous methods. Experiments on 9 real-world tasks further verify its practicality with an average success rate of 84.62%.</p>

We guide the latent denoising process in an optimization-based, training-free, manner by optimizing latents with our AMF loss to generate videos reproducing the motion of the reference one. We also apply our optimization strategy to transformer positional embeddings, granting us a boost in zero-shot motion transfer capabilities. We evaluate DiTFlow against recently published methods, outperforming all across multiple metrics and human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hortense Fong, George Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding when and why consumers engage with stories is crucial for content creators and platforms. While existing theories suggest that audience beliefs of what is going to happen should play an important role in engagement decisions, empirical work has mostly focused on developing techniques to directly extract features from actual content, rather than capturing forward-looking beliefs, due to the lack of a principled way to model such beliefs in unstructured narrative data. To complement existing feature extraction techniques, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to model audience forward-looking beliefs about how stories might unfold. Our method generates multiple potential continuations for each story and extracts features related to expectations, uncertainty, and surprise using established content analysis techniques. Applying our method to over 30,000 book chapters, we demonstrate that our framework complements existing feature engineering techniques by amplifying their marginal explanatory power on average by 31%. The results reveal that different types of engagement-continuing to read, commenting, and voting-are driven by distinct combinations of current and anticipated content features. Our framework provides a novel way to study and explore how audience forward-looking beliefs shape their engagement with narrative media, with implications for marketing strategy in content-focused industries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) image generation quality but suffer from high latency and memory inefficiency, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. One major efficiency bottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of an image. However, not all image tokens are equally important, and certain localized areas require more computation, such as objects. To address this, we propose DiffCR, a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable compression ratios, which automatically learns to dynamically route computation across layers and timesteps for each image token, resulting in efficient DiTs. Specifically, DiffCR integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing scheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is fine-tuned jointly with model weights to predict token importance scores. In this way, unimportant tokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying compression ratios from a zero initialization, resulting in large compression ratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even uncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each denoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern shows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes clearer. Extensive experiments on text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that DiffCR effectively captures dynamism across token, layer, and timestep axes, achieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency compared to prior works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghwan Cheon, Se-Bum Paik</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is crucial for various machine learning applications, yet it remains challenging. Many models exhibit hallucinations - confident yet inaccurate responses - due to miscalibrated confidence. Here, we show that the common practice of random initialization in deep learning, often considered a standard technique, is an underlying cause of this miscalibration, leading to excessively high confidence in untrained networks. Our method, inspired by developmental neuroscience, addresses this issue by simply pretraining networks with random noise and labels, reducing overconfidence and bringing initial confidence levels closer to chance. This ensures optimal calibration, aligning confidence with accuracy during subsequent data training, without the need for additional pre- or post-processing. Pre-calibrated networks excel at identifying "unknown data," showing low confidence for out-of-distribution inputs, thereby resolving confidence miscalibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenkun He, Yun Liu, Ruitao Liu, Li Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interaction motions is a critical problem in VR/AR and human animation. Unlike the commonly studied scenarios involving a single human or hand interacting with one object, we address a more generic multi-body setting with arbitrary numbers of humans, hands, and objects. This complexity introduces significant challenges in synchronizing motions due to the high correlations and mutual influences among bodies. To address these challenges, we introduce SyncDiff, a novel method for multi-body interaction synthesis using a synchronized motion diffusion strategy. SyncDiff employs a single diffusion model to capture the joint distribution of multi-body motions. To enhance motion fidelity, we propose a frequency-domain motion decomposition scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new set of alignment scores to emphasize the synchronization of different body motions. SyncDiff jointly optimizes both data sample likelihood and alignment likelihood through an explicit synchronization strategy. Extensive experiments across four datasets with various multi-body configurations demonstrate the superiority of SyncDiff over existing state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Niloy Mitra, Hyeonho Jeong, Jae Shin Yoon, Duygu Ceylan</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergent capabilities of image generators have led to many impactful zero- or few-shot applications. Inspired by this success, we investigate whether video generators similarly exhibit 3D-awareness. Using structure-from-motion as a 3D-aware task, we test if intermediate features of a video generator - OpenSora in our case - can support camera pose estimation. Surprisingly, at first, we only find a weak correlation between the two tasks. Deeper investigation reveals that although the video generator produces plausible video frames, the frames themselves are not truly 3D-consistent. Instead, we propose to jointly train for the two tasks, using photometric generation and 3D aware errors. Specifically, we find that SoTA video generation and camera pose estimation (i.e.,DUSt3R [79]) networks share common structures, and propose an architecture that unifies the two. The proposed unified model, named \nameMethod, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality while producing 3D-consistent videos. In summary, we propose the first unified video generator that is 3D-consistent, generates realistic video frames, and can potentially be repurposed for other 3D-aware tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily trained on English texts, often face biases and inaccuracies in Chinese contexts. Their limitations are pronounced in fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), where cultural and clinical subtleties are vital, further hindered by a lack of domain-specific data, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To address these issues, this paper introduces Hengqin-RA-v1, the first large language model specifically tailored for TCM with a focus on diagnosing and treating RA. We also present HQ-GCM-RA-C1, a comprehensive RA-specific dataset curated from ancient Chinese medical literature, classical texts, and modern clinical studies. This dataset empowers Hengqin-RA-v1 to deliver accurate and culturally informed responses, effectively bridging the gaps left by general-purpose models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hengqin-RA-v1 outperforms state-of-the-art models, even surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of TCM practitioners in certain cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the mainstream approach for visual generation. However, these models typically suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. Consequently, methods for efficient finetuning, inference and personalization were quickly adopted by the community. However, training these models in the first place remains very costly. While several recent approaches - including masking, distillation, and architectural modifications - have been proposed to improve training efficiency, each of these methods comes with a tradeoff: they achieve enhanced performance at the expense of increased computational cost or vice versa. In contrast, this work aims to improve training efficiency as well as generative performance at the same time through routes that act as a transport mechanism for randomly selected tokens from early layers to deeper layers of the model. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models and achieves this without architectural modifications or additional parameters. Finally, we show that TREAD reduces computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard ImageNet-256 benchmark in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 14x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 37x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations. Furthermore, we achieve a competitive FID of 2.09 in a guided and 3.93 in an unguided setting, which improves upon the DiT, without architectural changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal Awareness, the ability to reason dynamically based on the timestamp when a question is raised, is the key distinction between offline and online video LLMs. Unlike offline models, which rely on complete videos for static, post hoc analysis, online models process video streams incrementally and dynamically adapt their responses based on the timestamp at which the question is posed. Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional benchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our benchmark and code can be accessed at https://github.com/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yirong Zeng, Xiao Ding, Yuxian Wang, Weiwen Liu, Wu Ning, Yutai Hou, Xu Huang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is known as a promising approach to enhancing their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve it. Nevertheless, our investigation reveals that (1) training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from more synthetic data due to potential data diversity issues, resulting in poor performance in complex scenarios. Moreover, we find that (2) this challenge primarily manifests as minor discrepancies between the model's output and the ground truth response (termed as deficiency), such as errors in parameter values that require complex reasoning from the context to resolve. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate these challenges. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively identifying deficiency-related data, constructing fine-grained preference pairs to pinpoint deficiencies, and then applying preference optimization to optimize these deficiencies. Our experiments show that models trained using our method achieve about 12\% better performance than baseline models, outperforming larger open-source and closed-source models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqing Lian, Jie Zhu, Tianxu Lv, Shiyun Nie, Hang Fan, Guosheng Wu, Yunjun Ge, Lihua Li, Xiangxiang Zeng, Xiang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant differences in protein structures hinder the generalization of existing drug-target interaction (DTI) models, which often rely heavily on pre-learned binding principles or detailed annotations. In contrast, BioBridge designs an Inductive-Associative pipeline inspired by the workflow of scientists who base their accumulated expertise on drawing insights into novel drug-target pairs from weakly related references. BioBridge predicts novel drug-target interactions using limited sequence data, incorporating multi-level encoders with adversarial training to accumulate transferable binding principles. On these principles basis, BioBridge employs a dynamic prototype meta-learning framework to associate insights from weakly related annotations, enabling robust predictions for previously unseen drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioBridge surpasses existing models, especially for unseen proteins. Notably, when only homologous protein binding data is available, BioBridge proves effective for virtual screening of the epidermal growth factor receptor and adenosine receptor, underscoring its potential in drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter J. Bentley, Soo Ling Lim, Fuyuki Ishikawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion techniques have propelled image and video generation to unprecedented levels of quality, significantly accelerating the deployment and application of generative AI. However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data processing, and insufficient exploration of advanced techniques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capability, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffusion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high-quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input images. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong generalization capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanming Guo, Xiao Qian, Kevin Credit, Jin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reporting is critical for governments, businesses, and investors. However, adoption remains limited particularly among small and medium enterprises due to high implementation costs, fragmented emission factor databases, and a lack of robust sector classification methods. To address these challenges, we introduce Group Reasoning Emission Estimation Networks (GREEN), an AI-driven carbon accounting framework that standardizes enterprise-level emission estimation, constructs a large-scale benchmark dataset, and leverages a novel reasoning approach with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we compile textual descriptions for 20,850 companies with validated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) labels and align these with an economic model of carbon intensity factors. By reframing sector classification as an information retrieval task, we fine-tune Sentence-BERT models using a contrastive learning loss. To overcome the limitations of single-stage models in handling thousands of hierarchical categories, we propose a Group Reasoning method that ensembles LLM classifiers based on the natural NAICS ontology, decomposing the task into multiple sub-classification steps. We theoretically prove that this approach reduces classification uncertainty and computational complexity. Experiments on 1,114 NAICS categories yield state-of-the-art performance (83.68% Top-1, 91.47% Top-10 accuracy), and case studies on 20 companies report a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 45.88%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Xiong, Yujun Cai, Bryan Hooi, Nanyun Peng, Zhecheng Li, Yiwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they exhibit notable weaknesses in character-level string manipulation, struggling with fundamental operations such as character deletion, insertion, and substitution. These challenges stem primarily from tokenization constraints, despite the critical role of such operations in data preprocessing and code generation. Through systematic analysis, we derive two key insights: (1) LLMs face significant difficulties in leveraging intrinsic token knowledge for character-level reasoning, and (2) atomized word structures can substantially enhance LLMs' ability to process token-level structural information. Building on these insights, we propose Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer, a novel approach designed to bridge the gap between token-level processing and character-level manipulation. Our method decomposes complex operations into explicit character-level subtasks coupled with controlled token reconstruction phases, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. Without additional training, our method significantly improves accuracies on the $\texttt{Deletion}$, $\texttt{Insertion}$, and $\texttt{Substitution}$ tasks. To support further research, we open-source our implementation and benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyundong Cho, Karishma Sharma, Nicolaas Jedema, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Alessandro Moschitti, Ravi Krishnan, Jonathan May</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are aligned to the collective voice of many, resulting in generic outputs that do not align with specific users' styles. In this work, we present Trial-Error-Explain In-Context Learning} (ITCL), a tuning-free method that personalizes language models for text generation tasks with fewer than 10 examples per user. TICL iteratively expands an in-context learning prompt via a trial-error-explain process, adding model-generated negative samples and explanations that provide fine-grained guidance towards a specific user's style. TICL achieves favorable win rates on pairwise comparisons with LLM-as-a-judge up to 91.5% against the previous state-of-the-art and outperforms competitive tuning-free baselines for personalized alignment tasks of writing emails, essays and news articles. Both lexical and qualitative analyses show that the negative samples and explanations enable language models to learn stylistic context more effectively and overcome the bias towards structural and formal phrases observed in their zero-shot outputs. By front-loading inference compute to create a user-specific in-context learning prompt that does not require extra generation steps at test time, TICL presents a novel yet simple approach for personalized alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Typhoon T1, an open effort to develop an open Thai reasoning model. A reasoning model is a relatively new type of generative model built on top of large language models (LLMs). A reasoning model generates a long chain of thought before arriving at a final answer, an approach found to improve performance on complex tasks. However, details on developing such a model are limited, especially for reasoning models that can generate traces in a low-resource language. Typhoon T1 presents an open effort that dives into the details of developing a reasoning model in a more cost-effective way by leveraging supervised fine-tuning using open datasets, instead of reinforcement learning. This paper shares the details about synthetic data generation and training, as well as our dataset and model weights. Additionally, we provide insights gained from developing a reasoning model that generalizes across domains and is capable of generating reasoning traces in a low-resource language, using Thai as an example. We hope this open effort provides a foundation for further research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunat Pipatanakul, Pittawat Taveekitworachai, Potsawee Manakul, Kasima Tharnpipitchai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates data selection and model merging methodologies aimed at incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities such as those of DeepSeek R1 into language-specific large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on the Thai LLM. Our goal is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs while maintaining their target language abilities. DeepSeek R1 excels in reasoning but primarily benefits high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. However, low-resource languages remain underserved due to the dominance of English-centric training data and model optimizations, which limit performance in these languages. This limitation results in unreliable code-switching and diminished effectiveness on tasks in low-resource languages. Meanwhile, local and regional LLM initiatives have attempted to bridge this gap by developing language-specific LLMs that focus on improving local linguistic fidelity. We demonstrate that, with only publicly available datasets and a computational budget of $120, it is possible to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs to match the level of DeepSeek R1, without compromising their performance on target language tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10581">Do We Need to Verify Step by Step? Rethinking Process Supervision from a Theoretical Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Jia, Alexander Rakhlin, Tengyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models have evolved, it has become crucial to distinguish between process supervision and outcome supervision -- two key reinforcement learning approaches to complex reasoning tasks. While process supervision offers intuitive advantages for long-term credit assignment, the precise relationship between these paradigms has remained an open question. Conventional wisdom suggests that outcome supervision is fundamentally more challenging due to the trajectory-level coverage problem, leading to significant investment in collecting fine-grained process supervision data.
  In this paper, we take steps towards resolving this debate. Our main theorem shows that, under standard data coverage assumptions, reinforcement learning through outcome supervision is no more statistically difficult than through process supervision, up to polynomial factors in horizon. At the core of this result lies the novel Change of Trajectory Measure Lemma -- a technical tool that bridges return-based trajectory measure and step-level distribution shift. Furthermore, for settings with access to a verifier or a rollout capability, we prove that any policy's advantage function can serve as an optimal process reward model, providing a direct connection between outcome and process supervision. These findings suggest that the empirically observed performance gap -- if any -- between outcome and process supervision likely stems from algorithmic limitations rather than inherent statistical difficulties, potentially transforming how we approach data collection and algorithm design for reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumin Jo, Junseong Choi, Jiho Kim, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without additional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing frameworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They also rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across multiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while reducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning. It reduces reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference. The code is available at https://github.com/ekrxjwh2009/R2-KG/.</p>

Recent works have introduced innovative architectures for time series models, such as the Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), which leverages multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to enhance prediction accuracy by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies within the data. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time-series forecasting by modifying TSMixer with a KAN layer (TSKANMixer). Experimental results demonstrate that TSKANMixer tends to improve prediction accuracy over the original TSMixer across multiple datasets, ranking among the top-performing models compared to other time series approaches. Our results show that the KANs are promising alternatives to improve the performance of time series forecasting by replacing or extending traditional MLPs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) show promising results in video reasoning. Popular Multi-Modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) frameworks usually apply naive uniform sampling to reduce the number of video frames that are fed into an M-LLM, particularly for long context videos. However, it could lose crucial context in certain periods of a video, so that the downstream M-LLM may not have sufficient visual information to answer a question. To attack this pain point, we propose a light-weight M-LLM -based frame selection method that adaptively select frames that are more relevant to users' queries. In order to train the proposed frame selector, we introduce two supervision signals (i) Spatial signal, where single frame importance score by prompting a M-LLM; (ii) Temporal signal, in which multiple frames selection by prompting Large Language Model (LLM) using the captions of all frame candidates. The selected frames are then digested by a frozen downstream video M-LLM for visual reasoning and question answering. Empirical results show that the proposed M-LLM video frame selector improves the performances various downstream video Large Language Model (video-LLM) across medium (ActivityNet, NExT-QA) and long (EgoSchema, LongVideoBench) context video question answering benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, but their potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a classic challenge in combinatorial optimization that requires efficient job allocation to machines to minimize makespan. To this end, we introduce Starjob, the first supervised dataset for JSSP, comprising 130k instances specifically designed for training LLMs. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune the LLaMA 8B 4-bit quantized model with the LoRA method to develop an end-to-end scheduling approach. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based method not only surpasses traditional Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) but also achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art neural approaches like L2D, with an average improvement of 15.36% on DMU and 7.85% on Taillard benchmarks. These results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs in tackling combinatorial optimization problems, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Liming Zhao, Yang Li, Chen-Wei Xie, Yehui Tang, Xudong Lu, Zhihang Liu, Yun Zheng, Yu Liu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/CDT.</p>

<p>Abstract: General-purpose multilingual vector representations, used in retrieval, regression and classification, are traditionally obtained from bidirectional encoder models. Despite their wide applicability, encoders have been recently overshadowed by advances in generative decoder-only models. However, many innovations driving this progress are not inherently tied to decoders. In this paper, we revisit the development of multilingual encoders through the lens of these advances, and introduce EuroBERT, a family of multilingual encoders covering European and widely spoken global languages. Our models outperform existing alternatives across a diverse range of tasks, spanning multilingual capabilities, mathematics, and coding, and natively supporting sequences of up to 8,192 tokens. We also examine the design decisions behind EuroBERT, offering insights into our dataset composition and training pipeline. We publicly release the EuroBERT models, including intermediate training checkpoints, together with our training framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Ning, Zaitian Wang, Ran Zhang, Ping Xu, Kunpeng Liu, Pengyang Wang, Wei Ju, Pengfei Wang, Yuanchun Zhou, Erik Cambria, Chong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issues: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of "proximity to the pre-learned cluster center". With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhe Wang, Xiaoya Li, Jiwei Li, Guoyin Wang, Xiaofei Sun, Bob Zhu, Han Qiu, Mo Yu, Shengjie Shen, Tianwei Zhang, Eduard Hovy</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the data-driven nature of current face identity (FaceID) customization methods, all state-of-the-art models rely on large-scale datasets containing millions of high-quality text-image pairs for training. However, none of these datasets are publicly available, which restricts transparency and hinders further advancements in the field.
  To address this issue, in this paper, we collect and release FaceID-6M, the first large-scale, open-source FaceID dataset containing 6 million high-quality text-image pairs. Filtered from LAION-5B \cite{schuhmann2022laion}, FaceID-6M undergoes a rigorous image and text filtering steps to ensure dataset quality, including resolution filtering to maintain high-quality images and faces, face filtering to remove images that lack human faces, and keyword-based strategy to retain descriptions containing human-related terms (e.g., nationality, professions and names). Through these cleaning processes, FaceID-6M provides a high-quality dataset optimized for training powerful FaceID customization models, facilitating advancements in the field by offering an open resource for research and development.
  We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our FaceID-6M, demonstrating that models trained on our FaceID-6M dataset achieve performance that is comparable to, and slightly better than currently available industrial models. Additionally, to support and advance research in the FaceID customization community, we make our code, datasets, and models fully publicly available.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Patil, Amardeep Kour Gedhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in predicting mental health outcomes from online text, yet traditional classification methods often lack interpretability and robustness. This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yu Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in the tensor version of transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference. While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanisms [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. Furthermore, we introduce two types of tensor attention cache and present a trade-off between time and memory for two scenarios. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the time-memory tradeoff of KV-Cache compression in tensor attention decoding and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient tensor attention Transformer architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing effective visual inspection models remains challenging due to the scarcity of defect data. While image generation models have been used to synthesize defect images, producing highly realistic defects remains difficult. We propose DefectFill, a novel method for realistic defect generation that requires only a few reference defect images. It leverages a fine-tuned inpainting diffusion model, optimized with our custom loss functions incorporating defect, object, and attention terms. It enables precise capture of detailed, localized defect features and their seamless integration into defect-free objects. Additionally, our Low-Fidelity Selection method further enhances the defect sample quality. Experiments show that DefectFill generates high-quality defect images, enabling visual inspection models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec AD dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: General-purpose robots need a versatile body and an intelligent mind. Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text classification, a fundamental task in natural language processing, aims to categorize textual data into predefined labels. Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. However, the advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite these improvements, existing models still exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN). DBEAN integrates bidirectional temporal modeling with self-attention mechanisms. It dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Kim, Seung-Woo Seo, Seong-Woo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Yang, Shilin Lu, Shizheng Wang, Meng Hwa Er, Zengwei Zheng, Alex C. Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Zhu, Endong Sun, Guanhe Huang, Oya Celiktutan</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual adaptation is essential for general autonomous agents. For example, a household robot pretrained with a repertoire of skills must still adapt to unseen tasks specific to each household. Motivated by this, building upon parameter-efficient fine-tuning in language models, prior works have explored lightweight adapters to adapt pretrained policies, which can preserve learned features from the pretraining phase and demonstrate good adaptation performances. However, these approaches treat task learning separately, limiting knowledge transfer between tasks. In this paper, we propose Online Meta-Learned adapters (OMLA). Instead of applying adapters directly, OMLA can facilitate knowledge transfer from previously learned tasks to current learning tasks through a novel meta-learning objective. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that OMLA can lead to better adaptation performances compared to the baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhu Wen, Ashwin Innuganti, Aaron Bien Ramos, Hanqing Guo, Qiben Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio watermarking is increasingly used to verify the provenance of AI-generated content, enabling applications such as detecting AI-generated speech, protecting music IP, and defending against voice cloning. To be effective, audio watermarks must resist removal attacks that distort signals to evade detection. While many schemes claim robustness, these claims are typically tested in isolation and against a limited set of attacks. A systematic evaluation against diverse removal attacks is lacking, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate whether recent watermarking schemes that claim robustness can withstand a broad range of removal attacks. First, we introduce a taxonomy covering 22 audio watermarking schemes. Next, we summarize their underlying technologies and potential vulnerabilities. We then present a large-scale empirical study to assess their robustness. To support this, we build an evaluation framework encompassing 22 types of removal attacks (109 configurations) including signal-level, physical-level, and AI-induced distortions. We reproduce 9 watermarking schemes using open-source code, identify 8 new highly effective attacks, and highlight 11 key findings that expose the fundamental limitations of these methods across 3 public datasets. Our results reveal that none of the surveyed schemes can withstand all tested distortions. This evaluation offers a comprehensive view of how current watermarking methods perform under real-world threats. Our demo and code are available at https://sokaudiowm.github.io/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of deep learning models in clinical prediction tasks, explainability remains a significant challenge. Inspired by transformer architectures, we introduce the Temporal-Feature Cross Attention Mechanism (TFCAM), a novel deep learning framework designed to capture dynamic interactions among clinical features across time, enhancing both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In an experiment with 1,422 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, predicting progression to End-Stage Renal Disease, TFCAM outperformed LSTM and RETAIN baselines, achieving an AUROC of 0.95 and an F1-score of 0.69. Beyond performance gains, TFCAM provides multi-level explainability by identifying critical temporal periods, ranking feature importance, and quantifying how features influence each other across time before affecting predictions. Our approach addresses the "black box" limitations of deep learning in healthcare, offering clinicians transparent insights into disease progression mechanisms while maintaining state-of-the-art predictive performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce RGB-Th-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to comprehend RGB-Thermal image pairs. While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The surge in generative AI workloads has created a need for scalable inference systems that can flexibly harness both GPUs and specialized accelerators while containing operational costs. This paper proposes a hardware-agnostic control loop that adaptively allocates requests across heterogeneous accelerators based on real-time cost and capacity signals. The approach sustains low latency and high throughput by dynamically shifting between cost-optimized and capacity-optimized modes, ensuring the most efficient use of expensive compute resources under fluctuating availability. Evaluated using the Stable Diffusion model, the framework consistently meets latency targets, automatically redirects traffic during capacity shortfalls, and capitalizes on lower-cost accelerators when possible. These results highlight how a feedback-driven deployment strategy, spanning the entire software and hardware stack, can help organizations efficiently scale generative AI workloads while maintaining resilience in the face of limited accelerator capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Huang, Ao Chang, Haoran Dou, Xing Tao, Xinrui Zhou, Yan Cao, Ruobing Huang, Alejandro F Frangi, Lingyun Bao, Xin Yang, Dong Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajie Tan, Yuheng Ji, Xiaoshuai Hao, Minglan Lin, Pengwei Wang, Zhongyuan Wang, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual reasoning abilities play a crucial role in understanding complex multimodal data, advancing both domain-specific applications and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Existing methods improve VLM reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning, using meticulously annotated training data to enhance visual reasoning capabilities. However, this training paradigm may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, restricting the model's ability to transfer visual reasoning skills across domains and limiting its real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning framework that significantly enhances generalization capabilities in visual reasoning tasks. Reason-RFT introduces a two-phase training framework for visual reasoning: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data activates the reasoning potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), followed by (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning that generates multiple reasoning-response pairs, significantly enhancing generalization in visual reasoning tasks. To evaluate Reason-RFT's visual reasoning capabilities, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset spanning visual counting, structure perception, and spatial transformation. Experimental results demonstrate Reasoning-RFT's three key advantages: (1) Performance Enhancement: achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks, outperforming most mainstream open-source and proprietary models; (2) Generalization Superiority: consistently maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks and domains, outperforming alternative training paradigms; (3) Data Efficiency: excelling in few-shot learning scenarios while surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines.
