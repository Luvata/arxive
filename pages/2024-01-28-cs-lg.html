<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13671">Determinants of renewable energy consumption in Madagascar: Evidence from feature selection algorithms. (arXiv:2401.13671v1 [econ.GN])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/econ/1/au:+Ramaharo_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Franck Ramaharo</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/econ/1/au:+Randriamifidy_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Fitiavana Randriamifidy</a></p>
<p>The aim of this note is to identify the factors influencing renewable energy
consumption in Madagascar. We tested 12 features covering macroeconomic,
financial, social, and environmental aspects, including economic growth,
domestic investment, foreign direct investment, financial development,
industrial development, inflation, income distribution, trade openness,
exchange rate, tourism development, environmental quality, and urbanization. To
assess their significance, we assumed a linear relationship between renewable
energy consumption and these features over the 1990-2021 period. Next, we
applied different machine learning feature selection algorithms classified as
filter-based (relative importance for linear regression, correlation method),
embedded (LASSO), and wrapper-based (best subset regression, stepwise
regression, recursive feature elimination, iterative predictor weighting
partial least squares, Boruta, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms)
methods. Our analysis revealed that the five most influential drivers stem from
macroeconomic aspects. We found that domestic investment, foreign direct
investment, and inflation positively contribute to the adoption of renewable
energy sources. On the other hand, industrial development and trade openness
negatively affect renewable energy consumption in Madagascar.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13695">Inverse analysis of granular flows using differentiable graph neural network simulator. (arXiv:2401.13695v1 [physics.geo-ph])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/physics/1/au:+Choi_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yongjin Choi</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/physics/1/au:+Kumar_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">Krishna Kumar</a></p>
<p>Inverse problems in granular flows, such as landslides and debris flows,
involve estimating material parameters or boundary conditions based on target
runout profile. Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems
are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible.
Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization
methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable.
While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency
and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training
data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail
to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel
differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode
automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based
optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular
flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the
graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS
shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and
multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties
and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle
locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS
framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse
problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based
optimization.

<p>The Internet of things (IoT) can significantly enhance the quality of human
life, specifically in healthcare, attracting extensive attentions to
IoT-healthcare services. Meanwhile, the human digital twin (HDT) is proposed as
an innovative paradigm that can comprehensively characterize the replication of
the individual human body in the digital world and reflect its physical status
in real time. Naturally, HDT is envisioned to empower IoT-healthcare beyond the
application of healthcare monitoring by acting as a versatile and vivid human
digital testbed, simulating the outcomes and guiding the practical treatments.
However, successfully establishing HDT requires high-fidelity virtual modeling
and strong information interactions but possibly with scarce, biased and noisy
data. Fortunately, a recent popular technology called generative artificial
intelligence (GAI) may be a promising solution because it can leverage advanced
AI algorithms to automatically create, manipulate, and modify valuable while
diverse data. This survey particularly focuses on the implementation of
GAI-driven HDT in IoT-healthcare. We start by introducing the background of
IoT-healthcare and the potential of GAI-driven HDT. Then, we delve into the
fundamental techniques and present the overall framework of GAI-driven HDT.
After that, we explore the realization of GAI-driven HDT in detail, including
GAI-enabled data acquisition, communication, data management, digital modeling,
and data analysis. Besides, we discuss typical IoT-healthcare applications that
can be revolutionized by GAI-driven HDT, namely personalized health monitoring
and diagnosis, personalized prescription, and personalized rehabilitation.
Finally, we conclude this survey by highlighting some future research

<p>The need to understand the structure of hierarchical or high-dimensional data
is present in a variety of fields. Hyperbolic spaces have proven to be an
important tool for embedding computations and analysis tasks as their
non-linear nature lends itself well to tree or graph data. Subsequently, they
have also been used in the visualization of high-dimensional data, where they
exhibit increased embedding performance. However, none of the existing
dimensionality reduction methods for embedding into hyperbolic spaces scale
well with the size of the input data. That is because the embeddings are
computed via iterative optimization schemes and the computation cost of every
iteration is quadratic in the size of the input. Furthermore, due to the
non-linear nature of hyperbolic spaces, Euclidean acceleration structures
cannot directly be translated to the hyperbolic setting. This paper introduces
the first acceleration structure for hyperbolic embeddings, building upon a
polar quadtree. We compare our approach with existing methods and demonstrate
that it computes embeddings of similar quality in significantly less time.

<p>Topological data analysis (TDA) is gaining prominence across a wide spectrum
of machine learning tasks that spans from manifold learning to graph
classification. A pivotal technique within TDA is persistent homology (PH),
which furnishes an exclusive topological imprint of data by tracing the
evolution of latent structures as a scale parameter changes. Present PH tools
are confined to analyzing data through a single filter parameter. However, many
scenarios necessitate the consideration of multiple relevant parameters to
attain finer insights into the data. We address this issue by introducing the
Effective Multidimensional Persistence (EMP) framework. This framework empowers
the exploration of data by simultaneously varying multiple scale parameters.
The framework integrates descriptor functions into the analysis process,
yielding a highly expressive data summary. It seamlessly integrates established
single PH summaries into multidimensional counterparts like EMP Landscapes,
Silhouettes, Images, and Surfaces. These summaries represent data's
multidimensional aspects as matrices and arrays, aligning effectively with
diverse ML models. We provide theoretical guarantees and stability proofs for
EMP summaries. We demonstrate EMP's utility in graph classification tasks,
showing its effectiveness. Results reveal that EMP enhances various single PH
descriptors, outperforming cutting-edge methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

<p>Deploying neural networks on microcontroller units (MCUs) presents
substantial challenges due to their constrained computation and memory
resources. Previous researches have explored patch-based inference as a
strategy to conserve memory without sacrificing model accuracy. However, this
technique suffers from severe redundant computation overhead, leading to a
substantial increase in execution latency. A feasible solution to address this
issue is mixed-precision quantization, but it faces the challenges of accuracy
degradation and a time-consuming search time. In this paper, we propose
QuantMCU, a novel patch-based inference method that utilizes value-driven
mixed-precision quantization to reduce redundant computation. We first utilize
value-driven patch classification (VDPC) to maintain the model accuracy. VDPC
classifies patches into two classes based on whether they contain outlier
values. For patches containing outlier values, we apply 8-bit quantization to
the feature maps on the dataflow branches that follow. In addition, for patches
without outlier values, we utilize value-driven quantization search (VDQS) on
the feature maps of their following dataflow branches to reduce search time.
Specifically, VDQS introduces a novel quantization search metric that takes
into account both computation and accuracy, and it employs entropy as an
accuracy representation to avoid additional training. VDQS also adopts an
iterative approach to determine the bitwidth of each feature map to further
accelerate the search process. Experimental results on real-world MCU devices
show that QuantMCU can reduce computation by 2.2x on average while maintaining
comparable model accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art patch-based
inference methods.

<p>Ensuring safe adoption of AI tools in healthcare hinges on access to
sufficient data for training, testing and validation. In response to privacy
concerns and regulatory requirements, using synthetic data has been suggested.
Synthetic data is created by training a generator on real data to produce a
dataset with similar statistical properties. Competing metrics with differing
taxonomies for quality evaluation have been suggested, resulting in a complex
landscape. Optimising quality entails balancing considerations that make the
data fit for use, yet relevant dimensions are left out of existing frameworks.
We performed a comprehensive literature review on the use of quality evaluation
metrics on SD within the scope of tabular healthcare data and SD made using
deep generative methods. Based on this and the collective team experiences, we
developed a conceptual framework for quality assurance. The applicability was
benchmarked against a practical case from the Dutch National Cancer Registry.
We present a conceptual framework for quality assurance of SD for AI
applications in healthcare that aligns diverging taxonomies, expands on common
quality dimensions to include the dimensions of Fairness and Carbon footprint,
and proposes stages necessary to support real-life applications. Building trust
in synthetic data by increasing transparency and reducing the safety risk will
accelerate the development and uptake of trustworthy AI tools for the benefit
of patients. Despite the growing emphasis on algorithmic fairness and carbon
footprint, these metrics were scarce in the literature review. The overwhelming
focus was on statistical similarity using distance metrics while sequential
logic detection was scarce. A consensus-backed framework that includes all
relevant quality dimensions can provide assurance for safe and responsible
real-life applications of SD.

<p>Face recognition (FR) has been applied to nearly every aspect of daily life,
but it is always accompanied by the underlying risk of leaking private
information. At present, almost all attack models against FR rely heavily on
the presence of a classification layer. However, in practice, the FR model can
obtain complex features of the input via the model backbone, and then compare
it with the target for inference, which does not explicitly involve the outputs
of the classification layer adopting logit or other losses. In this work, we
advocate a novel inference attack composed of two stages for practical FR
models without a classification layer. The first stage is the membership
inference attack. Specifically, We analyze the distances between the
intermediate features and batch normalization (BN) parameters. The results
indicate that this distance is a critical metric for membership inference. We
thus design a simple but effective attack model that can determine whether a
face image is from the training dataset or not. The second stage is the model
inversion attack, where sensitive private data is reconstructed using a
pre-trained generative adversarial network (GAN) guided by the attack model in
the first stage. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed attack model is the
very first in the literature developed for FR models without a classification
layer. We illustrate the application of the proposed attack model in the
establishment of privacy-preserving FR techniques.

<p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Regression (UDAR) aims to adapt a model
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain for regression
tasks. Recent successful works in UDAR mostly focus on subspace alignment,
involving the alignment of a selected subspace within the entire feature space.
This contrasts with the feature alignment methods used for classification,
which aim at aligning the entire feature space and have proven effective but
are less so in regression settings. Specifically, while classification aims to
identify separate clusters across the entire embedding dimension, regression
induces less structure in the data representation, necessitating additional
guidance for efficient alignment. In this paper, we propose an effective method
for UDAR by incorporating guidance from uncertainty. Our approach serves a dual
purpose: providing a measure of confidence in predictions and acting as a
regularization of the embedding space. Specifically, we leverage the Deep
Evidential Learning framework, which outputs both predictions and uncertainties
for each input sample. We propose aligning the parameters of higher-order
evidential distributions between the source and target domains using
traditional alignment methods at the feature or posterior level. Additionally,
we propose to augment the feature space representation by mixing source samples
with pseudo-labeled target samples based on label similarity. This cross-domain
mixing strategy produces more realistic samples than random mixing and
introduces higher uncertainty, facilitating further alignment. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on four benchmarks for UDAR, on which we
outperform existing methods.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating multiple responses to
a single prompt, yet little effort has been expended to help end-users or
system designers make use of this capability. In this paper, we explore how to
present many LLM responses at once. We design five features, which include both
pre-existing and novel methods for computing similarities and differences
across textual documents, as well as how to render their outputs. We report on
a controlled user study (n=24) and eight case studies evaluating these features
and how they support users in different tasks. We find that the features
support a wide variety of sensemaking tasks and even make tasks previously
considered to be too difficult by our participants now tractable. Finally, we
present design guidelines to inform future explorations of new LLM interfaces.

<p>In response to everyday queries, humans explicitly signal uncertainty and
offer alternative answers when they are unsure. Machine learning models that
output calibrated prediction sets through conformal prediction mimic this human
behaviour; larger sets signal greater uncertainty while providing alternatives.
In this work, we study the usefulness of conformal prediction sets as an aid
for human decision making by conducting a pre-registered randomized controlled
trial with conformal prediction sets provided to human subjects. With
statistical significance, we find that when humans are given conformal
prediction sets their accuracy on tasks improves compared to fixed-size
prediction sets with the same coverage guarantee. The results show that
quantifying model uncertainty with conformal prediction is helpful for
human-in-the-loop decision making and human-AI teams.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13751">A Systematic Approach to Robustness Modelling for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. (arXiv:2401.13751v1 [cs.LG])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Meyers_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Charles Meyers</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Sedghpour_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mohammad Reza Saleh Sedghpour</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Lofstedt_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tommy L&#xf6;fstedt</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Elmroth_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Erik Elmroth</a></p>
<p>Convolutional neural networks have shown to be widely applicable to a large
number of fields when large amounts of labelled data are available. The recent
trend has been to use models with increasingly larger sets of tunable
parameters to increase model accuracy, reduce model loss, or create more
adversarially robust models -- goals that are often at odds with one another.
In particular, recent theoretical work raises questions about the ability for
even larger models to generalize to data outside of the controlled train and
test sets. As such, we examine the role of the number of hidden layers in the
ResNet model, demonstrated on the MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 datasets. We test a
variety of parameters including the size of the model, the floating point
precision, and the noise level of both the training data and the model output.
To encapsulate the model's predictive power and computational cost, we provide
a method that uses induced failures to model the probability of failure as a
function of time and relate that to a novel metric that allows us to quickly
determine whether or not the cost of training a model outweighs the cost of
attacking it. Using this approach, we are able to approximate the expected
failure rate using a small number of specially crafted samples rather than
increasingly larger benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
technique on both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets using 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit
floating-point numbers, various data pre-processing techniques, and several
attacks on five configurations of the ResNet model. Then, using empirical
measurements, we examine the various trade-offs between cost, robustness,
latency, and reliability to find that larger models do not significantly aid in
adversarial robustness despite costing significantly more to train.

<p>This paper offers a systematic method for creating medical knowledge-grounded
patient records for use in activities involving differential diagnosis.
Additionally, an assessment of machine learning models that can differentiate
between various conditions based on given symptoms is also provided. We use a
public disease-symptom data source called SymCat in combination with Synthea to
construct the patients records. In order to increase the expressive nature of
the synthetic data, we use a medically-standardized symptom modeling method
called NLICE to augment the synthetic data with additional contextual
information for each condition. In addition, Naive Bayes and Random Forest
models are evaluated and compared on the synthetic data. The paper shows how to
successfully construct SymCat-based and NLICE-based datasets. We also show
results for the effectiveness of using the datasets to train predictive disease
models. The SymCat-based dataset is able to train a Naive Bayes and Random
Forest model yielding a 58.8% and 57.1% Top-1 accuracy score, respectively. In
contrast, the NLICE-based dataset improves the results, with a Top-1 accuracy
of 82.0% and Top-5 accuracy values of more than 90% for both models. Our
proposed data generation approach solves a major barrier to the application of
artificial intelligence methods in the healthcare domain. Our novel NLICE
symptom modeling approach addresses the incomplete and insufficient information
problem in the current binary symptom representation approach. The NLICE code

<p>Graph topology inference, i.e., learning graphs from a given set of nodal
observations, is a significant task in many application domains. Existing
approaches are mostly limited to learning a single graph assuming that the
observed data is homogeneous. This is problematic because many modern datasets
are heterogeneous or mixed and involve multiple related graphs, i.e., multiview
graphs. Recent work proposing to learn multiview graphs ensures the similarity
of learned view graphs through pairwise regularization, where each pair of
views is encouraged to have similar structures. However, this approach cannot
infer the shared structure across views. In this work, we propose an
alternative method based on consensus regularization, where views are ensured
to be similar through a learned consensus graph representing the common
structure of the views. In particular, we propose an optimization problem,
where graph data is assumed to be smooth over the multiview graph and the
topology of the individual views and that of the consensus graph are learned,
simultaneously. Our optimization problem is designed to be general in the sense
that different regularization functions can be used depending on what the
shared structure across views is. Moreover, we propose two regularization
functions that extend fused and group graphical lasso to consensus based
regularization. Proposed multiview graph learning is evaluated on simulated
data and shown to have better performance than existing methods. It is also
employed to infer the functional brain connectivity networks of multiple
subjects from their electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The proposed method
reveals the structure shared by subjects as well as the characteristics unique
to each subject.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13779">Faster Convergence with Less Communication: Broadcast-Based Subgraph Sampling for Decentralized Learning over Wireless Networks. (arXiv:2401.13779v1 [cs.IT])</a></h1>

<p>Consensus-based decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) is a widely
adopted algorithm for decentralized training of machine learning models across
networked agents. A crucial part of D-SGD is the consensus-based model
averaging, which heavily relies on information exchange and fusion among the
nodes. Specifically, for consensus averaging over wireless networks,
communication coordination is necessary to determine when and how a node can
access the channel and transmit (or receive) information to (or from) its
neighbors. In this work, we propose $\texttt{BASS}$, a broadcast-based subgraph
sampling method designed to accelerate the convergence of D-SGD while
considering the actual communication cost per iteration. $\texttt{BASS}$
creates a set of mixing matrix candidates that represent sparser subgraphs of
the base topology. In each consensus iteration, one mixing matrix is sampled,
leading to a specific scheduling decision that activates multiple
collision-free subsets of nodes. The sampling occurs in a probabilistic manner,
and the elements of the mixing matrices, along with their sampling
probabilities, are jointly optimized. Simulation results demonstrate that
$\texttt{BASS}$ enables faster convergence with fewer transmission slots
compared to existing link-based scheduling methods. In conclusion, the inherent
broadcasting nature of wireless channels offers intrinsic advantages in
accelerating the convergence of decentralized optimization and learning.

<p>This paper examines the use of deep recurrent neural networks to classify
traffic patterns in smart cities. We propose a novel approach to traffic
pattern classification based on deep recurrent neural networks, which can
effectively capture traffic patterns' dynamic and sequential features. The
proposed model combines convolutional and recurrent layers to extract features
from traffic pattern data and a SoftMax layer to classify traffic patterns.
Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods
regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, we provide an
in depth analysis of the results and discuss the implications of the proposed
model for smart cities. The results show that the proposed model can accurately
classify traffic patterns in smart cities with a precision of as high as 95%.
The proposed model is evaluated on a real world traffic pattern dataset and
compared with existing classification methods.

<p>Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various domains, offering predictive
capabilities in several areas. However, with the increasing accessibility of ML
tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a "push the button"
approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding
of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises
concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as
incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML,
known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training
data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of
understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic
performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The
discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a
significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML,
discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow.
Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific
task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and
compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion
summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage
for robust and reliable ML applications.

<p>Advances in machine learning are closely tied to the creation of datasets.
While data documentation is widely recognized as essential to the reliability,
reproducibility, and transparency of ML, we lack a systematic empirical
understanding of current dataset documentation practices. To shed light on this
question, here we take Hugging Face -- one of the largest platforms for sharing
and collaborating on ML models and datasets -- as a prominent case study. By
analyzing all 7,433 dataset documentation on Hugging Face, our investigation
provides an overview of the Hugging Face dataset ecosystem and insights into
dataset documentation practices, yielding 5 main findings: (1) The dataset card
completion rate shows marked heterogeneity correlated with dataset popularity.
(2) A granular examination of each section within the dataset card reveals that
the practitioners seem to prioritize Dataset Description and Dataset Structure
sections, while the Considerations for Using the Data section receives the
lowest proportion of content. (3) By analyzing the subsections within each
section and utilizing topic modeling to identify key topics, we uncover what is
discussed in each section, and underscore significant themes encompassing both
technical and social impacts, as well as limitations within the Considerations
for Using the Data section. (4) Our findings also highlight the need for
improved accessibility and reproducibility of datasets in the Usage sections.
(5) In addition, our human annotation evaluation emphasizes the pivotal role of
comprehensive dataset content in shaping individuals' perceptions of a dataset
card's overall quality. Overall, our study offers a unique perspective on
analyzing dataset documentation through large-scale data science analysis and
underlines the need for more thorough dataset documentation in machine learning

<p>The age of information (AoI) is used to measure the freshness of the data. In
IoT networks, the traditional resource management schemes rely on a message
exchange between the devices and the base station (BS) before communication
which causes high AoI, high energy consumption, and low reliability. Unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying BSs have many advantages in minimizing the
AoI, energy-saving, and throughput improvement. In this paper, we present a
novel learning-based framework that estimates the traffic arrival of IoT
devices based on Markovian events. The learning proceeds to optimize the
trajectory of multiple UAVs and their scheduling policy. First, the BS predicts
the future traffic of the devices. We compare two traffic predictors: the
forward algorithm (FA) and the long short-term memory (LSTM). Afterward, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to optimize the optimal
policy of each UAV. Finally, we manipulate the optimum reward function for the
proposed DRL approach. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the random-walk (RW) baseline model regarding the AoI, scheduling
accuracy, and transmission power.

<p>For large language models (LLMs) to be trusted by humans they need to be
well-calibrated in the sense that they can accurately assess and communicate
how likely it is that their predictions are correct. Recent work has focused on
the quality of internal LLM confidence assessments, but the question remains of
how well LLMs can communicate this internal model confidence to human users.
This paper explores the disparity between external human confidence in an LLM's
responses and the internal confidence of the model. Through experiments
involving multiple-choice questions, we systematically examine human users'
ability to discern the reliability of LLM outputs. Our study focuses on two key
areas: (1) assessing users' perception of true LLM confidence and (2)
investigating the impact of tailored explanations on this perception. The
research highlights that default explanations from LLMs often lead to user
overestimation of both the model's confidence and its' accuracy. By modifying
the explanations to more accurately reflect the LLM's internal confidence, we
observe a significant shift in user perception, aligning it more closely with
the model's actual confidence levels. This adjustment in explanatory approach
demonstrates potential for enhancing user trust and accuracy in assessing LLM
outputs. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication of
confidence levels in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications where
understanding the reliability of AI-generated information is essential.

<p>With the rise of deep learning, there has been renewed interest within the
process industries to utilize data on large-scale nonlinear sensing and control
problems. We identify key statistical and machine learning techniques that have
seen practical success in the process industries. To do so, we start with
hybrid modeling to provide a methodological framework underlying core
application areas: soft sensing, process optimization, and control. Soft
sensing contains a wealth of industrial applications of statistical and machine
learning methods. We quantitatively identify research trends, allowing insight
into the most successful techniques in practice.
</p>
<p>We consider two distinct flavors for data-driven optimization and control:
hybrid modeling in conjunction with mathematical programming techniques and
reinforcement learning. Throughout these application areas, we discuss their
respective industrial requirements and challenges.
</p>
<p>A common challenge is the interpretability and efficiency of purely

techniques with domain knowledge. As a result, we highlight ways prior

<p>Future autonomous vehicles (AVs) will use a variety of sensors that generate
a vast amount of data. Naturally, this data not only serves self-driving
algorithms; but can also assist other vehicles or the infrastructure in
real-time decision-making. Consequently, vehicles shall exchange their
measurement data over Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies. Moreover,

<p>This report summarizes all the MIA experiments (Membership Inference Attacks)
of the Embedding Attack Project, including threat models, experimental setup,
experimental results, findings and discussion. Current results cover the
evaluation of two main MIA strategies (loss-based and embedding-based MIAs) on
6 AI models ranging from Computer Vision to Language Modelling. There are two
ongoing experiments on MIA defense and neighborhood-comparison embedding
attacks. These are ongoing projects.
</p>
<p>The current work on MIA and PIA can be summarized into six conclusions: (1)
Amount of overfitting is directly proportional to model's vulnerability; (2)
early embedding layers in the model are less susceptible to privacy leaks; (3)
Deeper model layers contain more membership information; (4) Models are more
vulnerable to MIA if both embeddings and corresponding training labels are
compromised; (5) it is possible to use pseudo-labels to increase the MIA
success; and (6) although MIA and PIA success rates are proportional, reducing
the MIA does not necessarily reduce the PIA.

<p>Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for
advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional
molecule generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score
and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains
unexplored. We introduce multi-conditional diffusion guidance. The proposed
Transformer-based denoising model has a condition encoder that learns the
representations of numerical and categorical conditions. The denoising model,
consisting of a structure encoder-decoder, is trained for denoising under the
representation of conditions. The diffusion process becomes graph-dependent to
accurately estimate graph-related noise in molecules, unlike the previous
models that focus solely on the marginal distributions of atoms or bonds. We
extensively validate our model for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule
generation. Results demonstrate our superiority across metrics from
distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. An inverse
polymer design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts
further demonstrates its practical utility.

<p>With the rapid advancement in cyber-physical systems, the increasing number
of sensors has significantly complicated manual monitoring of system states.
Consequently, graph-based time-series anomaly detection methods have gained
attention due to their ability to explicitly represent relationships between
sensors. However, these methods often apply a uniform source node
representation across all connected target nodes, even when updating different
target node representations. Moreover, the graph attention mechanism, commonly
used to infer unknown graph structures, could constrain the diversity of source
node representations. In this paper, we introduce the Edge Conditional
Node-update Graph Neural Network (ECNU-GNN). Our model, equipped with an edge
conditional node update module, dynamically transforms source node
representations based on connected edges to represent target nodes aptly. We
validate performance on three real-world datasets: SWaT, WADI, and PSM. Our
model demonstrates 5.4%, 12.4%, and 6.0% higher performance, respectively,
compared to best F1 baseline models.

<p>Dense-to-sparse gating mixture of experts (MoE) has recently become an
effective alternative to a well-known sparse MoE. Rather than fixing the number
of activated experts as in the latter model, which could limit the
investigation of potential experts, the former model utilizes the temperature
to control the softmax weight distribution and the sparsity of the MoE during
training in order to stabilize the expert specialization. Nevertheless, while
there are previous attempts to theoretically comprehend the sparse MoE, a
comprehensive analysis of the dense-to-sparse gating MoE has remained elusive.
Therefore, we aim to explore the impacts of the dense-to-sparse gate on the
maximum likelihood estimation under the Gaussian MoE in this paper. We
demonstrate that due to interactions between the temperature and other model
parameters via some partial differential equations, the convergence rates of
parameter estimations are slower than any polynomial rates, and could be as
slow as $\mathcal{O}(1/\log(n))$, where $n$ denotes the sample size. To address
this issue, we propose using a novel activation dense-to-sparse gate, which
routes the output of a linear layer to an activation function before delivering
them to the softmax function. By imposing linearly independence conditions on
the activation function and its derivatives, we show that the parameter
estimation rates are significantly improved to polynomial rates.

<p>Stochastic Approximation (SA) is a widely used algorithmic approach in
various fields, including optimization and reinforcement learning (RL). Among
RL algorithms, Q-learning is particularly popular due to its empirical success.
In this paper, we study asynchronous Q-learning with constant stepsize, which
is commonly used in practice for its fast convergence. By connecting the
constant stepsize Q-learning to a time-homogeneous Markov chain, we show the
distributional convergence of the iterates in Wasserstein distance and
establish its exponential convergence rate. We also establish a Central Limit
Theory for Q-learning iterates, demonstrating the asymptotic normality of the
averaged iterates. Moreover, we provide an explicit expansion of the asymptotic
bias of the averaged iterate in stepsize. Specifically, the bias is
proportional to the stepsize up to higher-order terms and we provide an
explicit expression for the linear coefficient. This precise characterization
of the bias allows the application of Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation
technique to construct a new estimate that is provably closer to the optimal Q
function. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical finding on the
improvement of the RR extrapolation method.

<p>Although supervised machine learning is popular for information extraction
from clinical notes, creating large annotated datasets requires extensive
domain expertise and is time-consuming. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated promising transfer learning capability. In this study, we
explored whether recent LLMs can reduce the need for large-scale data
annotations. We curated a manually-labeled dataset of 769 breast cancer
pathology reports, labeled with 13 categories, to compare zero-shot
classification capability of the GPT-4 model and the GPT-3.5 model with
supervised classification performance of three model architectures: random
forests classifier, long short-term memory networks with attention (LSTM-Att),
and the UCSF-BERT model. Across all 13 tasks, the GPT-4 model performed either
significantly better than or as well as the best supervised model, the LSTM-Att
model (average macro F1 score of 0.83 vs. 0.75). On tasks with high imbalance
between labels, the differences were more prominent. Frequent sources of GPT-4
errors included inferences from multiple samples and complex task design. On
complex tasks where large annotated datasets cannot be easily collected, LLMs
can reduce the burden of large-scale data labeling. However, if the use of LLMs
is prohibitive, the use of simpler supervised models with large annotated
datasets can provide comparable results. LLMs demonstrated the potential to
speed up the execution of clinical NLP studies by reducing the need for
curating large annotated datasets. This may result in an increase in the
utilization of NLP-based variables and outcomes in observational clinical
studies.

<p>Multimodal federated learning (MFL) has emerged as a decentralized machine
learning paradigm, allowing multiple clients with different modalities to
collaborate on training a machine learning model across diverse data sources
without sharing their private data. However, challenges, such as data
heterogeneity and severely missing modalities, pose crucial hindrances to the
robustness of MFL, significantly impacting the performance of global model. The
absence of a modality introduces misalignment during the local training phase,
stemming from zero-filling in the case of clients with missing modalities.
Consequently, achieving robust generalization in global model becomes
imperative, especially when dealing with clients that have incomplete data. In
this paper, we propose Multimodal Federated Cross Prototype Learning (MFCPL), a
novel approach for MFL under severely missing modalities by conducting the
complete prototypes to provide diverse modality knowledge in modality-shared
level with the cross-modal regularization and modality-specific level with
cross-modal contrastive mechanism. Additionally, our approach introduces the
cross-modal alignment to provide regularization for modality-specific features,
thereby enhancing overall performance, particularly in scenarios involving
severely missing modalities. Through extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MFCPL in mitigating these
challenges and improving the overall performance.

<p>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is a crucial technique in molecular polarity

Current approaches, utilizing either high-dimensional molecular fingerprints or

<p>Deep Learning has been successfully applied to many application domains, yet
its advantages have been slow to emerge for time series forecasting. For
example, in the well-known Makridakis (M) Competitions, hybrids of traditional
statistical or machine learning techniques have only recently become the top
performers. With the recent architectural advances in deep learning being
applied to time series forecasting (e.g., encoder-decoders with attention,
transformers, and graph neural networks), deep learning has begun to show
significant advantages. Still, in the area of pandemic prediction, there remain
challenges for deep learning models: the time series is not long enough for
effective training, unawareness of accumulated scientific knowledge, and
interpretability of the model. To this end, the development of foundation
models (large deep learning models with extensive pre-training) allows models
to understand patterns and acquire knowledge that can be applied to new related
problems before extensive training data becomes available. Furthermore, there
is a vast amount of knowledge available that deep learning models can tap into,
including Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models fine-tuned with scientific
domain knowledge. There is ongoing research examining how to utilize or inject
such knowledge into deep learning models. In this survey, several
state-of-the-art modeling techniques are reviewed, and suggestions for further

<p>The Mixtures-of-Experts (MoE) model is a widespread distributed and
integrated learning method for large language models (LLM), which is favored
due to its ability to sparsify and expand models efficiently. However, the
performance of MoE is limited by load imbalance and high latency of All-To-All
communication, along with relatively redundant computation owing to large
expert capacity. Load imbalance may result from existing routing policies that
consistently tend to select certain experts. The frequent inter-node
communication in the All-To-All procedure also significantly prolongs the
training time. To alleviate the above performance problems, we propose a novel
routing strategy that combines load balance and locality by converting partial
inter-node communication to that of intra-node. Notably, we elucidate that
there is a minimum threshold for expert capacity, calculated through the
maximal angular deviation between the gating weights of the experts and the
assigned tokens. We port these modifications on the PanGu-Sigma model based on
the MindSpore framework with multi-level routing and conduct experiments on
Ascend clusters. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed LocMoE
reduces training time per epoch by 12.68% to 22.24% compared to classical
routers, such as hash router and switch router, without impacting the model
accuracy.

<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents challenges in diagnosis and
treatment due to its complex and heterogeneous nature. Emerging evidence
indicates that reward processing abnormalities may serve as a behavioral marker
for MDD. To measure reward processing, patients perform computer-based
behavioral tasks that involve making choices or responding to stimulants that
are associated with different outcomes. Reinforcement learning (RL) models are
fitted to extract parameters that measure various aspects of reward processing
to characterize how patients make decisions in behavioral tasks. Recent
findings suggest the inadequacy of characterizing reward learning solely based
on a single RL model; instead, there may be a switching of decision-making
processes between multiple strategies. An important scientific question is how
the dynamics of learning strategies in decision-making affect the reward
learning ability of individuals with MDD. Motivated by the probabilistic reward
task (PRT) within the EMBARC study, we propose a novel RL-HMM framework for
analyzing reward-based decision-making. Our model accommodates learning
strategy switching between two distinct approaches under a hidden Markov model
(HMM): subjects making decisions based on the RL model or opting for random
choices. We account for continuous RL state space and allow time-varying
transition probabilities in the HMM. We introduce a computationally efficient
EM algorithm for parameter estimation and employ a nonparametric bootstrap for
inference. We apply our approach to the EMBARC study to show that MDD patients

<p>Utilizing distributed renewable and energy storage resources in local

<p>A reliable long-term time-series forecaster is highly demanded in practice
but comes across many challenges such as low computational and memory
footprints as well as robustness against dynamic learning environments. This
paper proposes Meta-Transformer Networks (MANTRA) to deal with the dynamic
long-term time-series forecasting tasks. MANTRA relies on the concept of fast
and slow learners where a collection of fast learners learns different aspects
of data distributions while adapting quickly to changes. A slow learner tailors
suitable representations to fast learners. Fast adaptations to dynamic
environments are achieved using the universal representation transformer layers
producing task-adapted representations with a small number of parameters. Our
experiments using four datasets with different prediction lengths demonstrate
the advantage of our approach with at least $3\%$ improvements over the
baseline algorithms for both multivariate and univariate settings. Source codes

<p>This paper considers stochastic weakly convex optimization without the
standard Lipschitz continuity assumption. Based on new adaptive regularization
(stepsize) strategies, we show that a wide class of stochastic algorithms,
including the stochastic subgradient method, preserve the $\mathcal{O} ( 1 /
\sqrt{K})$ convergence rate with constant failure rate. Our analyses rest on
rather weak assumptions: the Lipschitz parameter can be either bounded by a
general growth function of $\|x\|$ or locally estimated through independent
random samples.

<p>The decision making involved behind the mode choice is critical for
transportation planning. While statistical learning techniques like discrete
choice models have been used traditionally, machine learning (ML) models have
gained traction recently among the transportation planners due to their higher
predictive performance. However, the black box nature of ML models pose
significant interpretability challenges, limiting their practical application
in decision and policy making. This study utilised a dataset of $1350$
households belonging to low and low-middle income bracket in the city of
Bengaluru to investigate mode choice decision making behaviour using
Multinomial logit model and ML classifiers like decision trees, random forests,
extreme gradient boosting and support vector machines. In terms of accuracy,
random forest model performed the best ($0.788$ on training data and $0.605$ on
testing data) compared to all the other models. This research has adopted
modern interpretability techniques like feature importance and individual
conditional expectation plots to explain the decision making behaviour using ML
models. A higher travel costs significantly reduce the predicted probability of
bus usage compared to other modes (a $0.66\%$ and $0.34\%$ reduction using
Random Forests and XGBoost model for $10\%$ increase in travel cost). However,
reducing travel time by $10\%$ increases the preference for the metro ($0.16\%$
in Random Forests and 0.42% in XGBoost). This research augments the ongoing
research on mode choice analysis using machine learning techniques, which would
help in improving the understanding of the performance of these models with
real-world data in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.

<p>In this paper, we propose an architecture to harness the collective knowledge
of multiple trained LLMs to create a new state-of-the-art. At the core of this
framework is a LLM-based orchestrator that is adept at picking the right
underlying LLM experts for optimal task execution. Inspired by self-play in
reinforcement learning, we created a loop of query generation, orchestration,
and evaluation to generate training data for the orchestrator. Our evaluation
focused on the MMLU benchmark, employing models with 7B, 13B, and 34B
parameters available on Hugging Face. The results demonstrate new
state-of-the-art open-source models: Our Leeroo orchestrator achieves
performance on par with the Mixtral model while incurring only two-thirds of
its cost. Moreover, increasing the allowed cost surpasses Mixtral's accuracy by
over 5% at the same cost level, reaching an accuracy of 75.9%. Further
enhancements were observed when integrating GPT4 into the underlying model
pool. The Leeroo orchestrator nearly matches GPT4's performance at half the
cost and even exceeds GPT4's results with a 25% cost reduction. These findings
illustrate the potential of our architecture in creating state-of-the-art and
cost-effective LLMs by optimizing the synergy between multiple LLMs to achieve

<p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate convincing, fluent explanations.
However, different from humans, they often generate inconsistent explanations
on different inputs. For example, an LLM may generate the explanation "all
birds can fly" when answering the question "Can sparrows fly?" but meanwhile
answer "no" to the related question "Can penguins fly?". Explanations should be
consistent across related examples so that they allow a human to simulate the
LLM's decision process on multiple examples. We propose explanation-consistency
finetuning (EC-finetuning), a method that adapts LLMs to generate more
consistent natural-language explanations on related examples. EC-finetuning
involves finetuning LLMs on synthetic data that is carefully constructed to
contain consistent explanations. Across a variety of question-answering
datasets in various domains, EC-finetuning yields a 10.0% relative explanation
consistency improvement on four finetuning datasets, and generalizes to seven
out-of-distribution datasets not seen during finetuning (+4.5% relative). Code

<p>Most few-shot learning works rely on the same domain assumption between the
base and the target tasks, hindering their practical applications. This paper
proposes an adaptive transformer network (ADAPTER), a simple but effective
solution for cross-domain few-shot learning where there exist large domain
shifts between the base task and the target task. ADAPTER is built upon the
idea of bidirectional cross-attention to learn transferable features between
the two domains. The proposed architecture is trained with DINO to produce
diverse, and less biased features to avoid the supervision collapse problem.
Furthermore, the label smoothing approach is proposed to improve the
consistency and reliability of the predictions by also considering the
predicted labels of the close samples in the embedding space. The performance
of ADAPTER is rigorously evaluated in the BSCD-FSL benchmarks in which it
outperforms prior arts with significant margins.

<p>Retrieval-augmented language models (RaLM) have demonstrated the potential to
solve knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP) tasks by combining
a non-parametric knowledge base with a parametric language model. Instead of
fine-tuning a fully parametric model, RaLM excels at its low-cost adaptation to
the latest data and better source attribution mechanisms. Among various RaLM
approaches, iterative RaLM delivers a better generation quality due to a more
frequent interaction between the retriever and the language model. Despite the
benefits, iterative RaLM usually encounters high overheads due to the frequent
retrieval step. To this end, we propose RaLMSpec, a speculation-inspired
framework that provides generic speed-up over iterative RaLM while preserving
the same model outputs through speculative retrieval and batched verification.
By further incorporating prefetching, optimal speculation stride scheduler, and
asynchronous verification, RaLMSpec can automatically exploit the acceleration
potential to the fullest. For naive iterative RaLM serving, extensive
evaluations over three language models on four downstream QA datasets
demonstrate that RaLMSpec can achieve a speed-up ratio of 1.75-2.39x,
1.04-1.39x, and 1.31-1.77x when the retriever is an exact dense retriever,
approximate dense retriever, and sparse retriever respectively compared with
the baseline. For KNN-LM serving, RaLMSpec can achieve a speed-up ratio up to
7.59x and 2.45x when the retriever is an exact dense retriever and approximate
dense retriever, respectively, compared with the baseline.

genomic data. Among these, methods such as k-mer counting have proven effective
in distinguishing sequences from varied species like chimpanzees, dogs, and
humans, becoming a staple in contemporary genomic research. However, these

algorithms, such as Gzip, Brotli, and LZMA, to efficiently process and classify

resource-efficient alternative to traditional machine learning methods. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness in
accurately classifying DNA sequences from multiple species. We present a

Furthermore, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for

<p>To tackle the scarcity and privacy issues associated with domain-specific
datasets, the integration of federated learning in conjunction with fine-tuning
has emerged as a practical solution. However, our findings reveal that
federated learning has the risk of skewing fine-tuning features and
compromising the out-of-distribution robustness of the model. By introducing
three robustness indicators and conducting experiments across diverse robust
datasets, we elucidate these phenomena by scrutinizing the diversity,
transferability, and deviation within the model feature space. To mitigate the
negative impact of federated learning on model robustness, we introduce GNP, a
\underline{G}eneral \underline{N}oisy \underline{P}rojection-based robust
algorithm, ensuring no deterioration of accuracy on the target distribution.
Specifically, the key strategy for enhancing model robustness entails the
transfer of robustness from the pre-trained model to the fine-tuned model,
coupled with adding a small amount of Gaussian noise to augment the
representative capacity of the model. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach markedly enhances the robustness across diverse
scenarios, encompassing various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and
confronting different levels of data heterogeneity.

reveal the vulnerability phenomenon, and understanding the mechanisms behind
this is essential for improving neural network characteristics and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse universal white-box

providing sparsity to $(p,q)$-singular vectors of the hidden layers of Jacobian
matrices. Using the ImageNet benchmark validation subset, we analyze the

solve the task. Furthermore, we investigate that the constructed perturbations
are highly transferable among different models without significantly decreasing
the fooling rate. Our findings demonstrate the vulnerability of

<p>Recently, semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques have shown great promise
in providing accurate Lipschitz bounds for neural networks. Specifically, the
LipSDP approach (Fazlyab et al., 2019) has received much attention and provides
the least conservative Lipschitz upper bounds that can be computed with
polynomial time guarantees. However, one main restriction of LipSDP is that its
formulation requires the activation functions to be slope-restricted on
$[0,1]$, preventing its further use for more general activation functions such
as GroupSort, MaxMin, and Householder. One can rewrite MaxMin activations for
example as residual ReLU networks. However, a direct application of LipSDP to
the resultant residual ReLU networks is conservative and even fails in
recovering the well-known fact that the MaxMin activation is 1-Lipschitz. Our
paper bridges this gap and extends LipSDP beyond slope-restricted activation
functions. To this end, we provide novel quadratic constraints for GroupSort,
MaxMin, and Householder activations via leveraging their underlying properties
such as sum preservation. Our proposed analysis is general and provides a
unified approach for estimating $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ Lipschitz bounds for
a rich class of neural network architectures, including non-residual and
residual neural networks and implicit models, with GroupSort, MaxMin, and
Householder activations. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our approach
with a variety of experiments and show that our proposed SDPs generate less
conservative Lipschitz bounds in comparison to existing approaches.

<p>Neural Network movement controllers promise a variety of advantages over
conventional control methods however they are not widely adopted due to their
inability to produce reliably precise movements. This research explores a
bilateral neural network architecture as a control system for motor tasks. We
aimed to achieve hemispheric specialisation similar to what is observed in
humans across different tasks; the dominant system (usually the right hand,
left hemisphere) excels at tasks involving coordination and efficiency of
movement, and the non-dominant system performs better at tasks requiring
positional stability. Specialisation was achieved by training the hemispheres
with different loss functions tailored toward the expected behaviour of the
respective hemispheres. We compared bilateral models with and without
specialised hemispheres, with and without inter-hemispheric connectivity
(representing the biological Corpus Callosum), and unilateral models with and
without specialisation. The models were trained and tested on two tasks common
in the human motor control literature: the random reach task, suited to the
dominant system, a model with better coordination, and the hold position task,
suited to the non-dominant system, a model with more stable movement. Each
system out-performed the non-favoured system in its preferred task. For both
tasks, a bilateral model outperforms the 'non-preferred' hand, and is as good
or better than the 'preferred' hand. The Corpus Callosum tends to improve
performance, but not always for the specialised models.

<p>Wind power generated by wind has non-schedule nature due to stochastic nature
of meteorological variable. Hence energy business and control of wind power
generation requires prediction of wind speed (WS) from few seconds to different
time steps in advance. To deal with prediction shortcomings, various WS
prediction methods have been used. Predictive data mining offers variety of
methods for WS predictions where artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the
reliable and accurate methods. It is observed from the result of this study
that ANN gives better accuracy in comparison conventional model. The accuracy
of WS prediction models is found to be dependent on input parameters and
architecture type algorithms utilized. So the selection of most relevant input
parameters is important research area in WS predicton field. The objective of
the paper is twofold: first extensive review of ANN for wind power and WS
prediction is carried out. Discussion and analysis of feature selection using
Relief Algorithm (RA) in WS prediction are considered for different Indian

<p>Wasserstein Gradient Flows (WGF) with respect to specific functionals have
been widely used in the machine learning literature. Recently, neural networks
have been adopted to approximate certain intractable parts of the underlying
Wasserstein gradient flow and result in efficient inference procedures. In this
paper, we introduce the Neural Sinkhorn Gradient Flow (NSGF) model, which
parametrizes the time-varying velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow
w.r.t. the Sinkhorn divergence to the target distribution starting a given
source distribution. We utilize the velocity field matching training scheme in
NSGF, which only requires samples from the source and target distribution to
compute an empirical velocity field approximation. Our theoretical analyses
show that as the sample size increases to infinity, the mean-field limit of the
empirical approximation converges to the true underlying velocity field. To
further enhance model efficiency on high-dimensional tasks, a two-phase NSGF++
model is devised, which first follows the Sinkhorn flow to approach the image
manifold quickly ($\le 5$ NFEs) and then refines the samples along a simple
straight flow. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world benchmark
datasets support our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods.

<p>Weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) has emerged as a solution to mitigate
the conflict between annotation cost and model performance by adopting sparse
annotation formats (e.g., point, scribble, block, etc.). Typical approaches
attempt to exploit anatomy and topology priors to directly expand sparse
annotations into pseudo-labels. However, due to a lack of attention to the
ambiguous edges in medical images and insufficient exploration of sparse
supervision, existing approaches tend to generate erroneous and overconfident
pseudo proposals in noisy regions, leading to cumulative model error and
performance degradation. In this work, we propose a novel WSS approach, named
ProCNS, encompassing two synergistic modules devised with the principles of
progressive prototype calibration and noise suppression. Specifically, we
design a Prototype-based Regional Spatial Affinity (PRSA) loss to maximize the
pair-wise affinities between spatial and semantic elements, providing our model
of interest with more reliable guidance. The affinities are derived from the
input images and the prototype-refined predictions. Meanwhile, we propose an
Adaptive Noise Perception and Masking (ANPM) module to obtain more enriched and
representative prototype representations, which adaptively identifies and masks
noisy regions within the pseudo proposals, reducing potential erroneous
interference during prototype computation. Furthermore, we generate specialized
soft pseudo-labels for the noisy regions identified by ANPM, providing
supplementary supervision. Extensive experiments on three medical image
segmentation tasks involving different modalities demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods

<p>This paper presents a novel operational matrix method to accelerate the
training of fractional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (fPINNs). Our approach
involves a non-uniform discretization of the fractional Caputo operator,
facilitating swift computation of fractional derivatives within Caputo-type
fractional differential problems with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. In this methodology, the
operational matrix is precomputed, and during the training phase, automatic
differentiation is replaced with a matrix-vector product. While our methodology
is compatible with any network, we particularly highlight its successful
implementation in PINNs, emphasizing the enhanced accuracy achieved when
utilizing the Legendre Neural Block (LNB) architecture. LNB incorporates
Legendre polynomials into the PINN structure, providing a significant boost in
accuracy. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated across diverse
differential equations, including Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) and
Systems of Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). To demonstrate its
versatility, we extend the application of the method to systems of differential
equations, specifically addressing nonlinear Pantograph fractional-order
DDEs/DAEs. The results are supported by a comprehensive analysis of numerical
outcomes.

<p>Due to user demand and recent regulation (GDPR, AI Act), decisions made by AI
systems need to be explained. These decisions are often explainable only post
hoc, where counterfactual explanations are popular. The question of what
constitutes the best counterfactual explanation must consider multiple aspects,
where "distance from the sample" is the most common. We argue that this
requirement frequently leads to explanations that are unlikely and, therefore,
of limited value. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood
explanations. We show that the search for the most likely explanations
satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be
modeled using mixed-integer optimization (MIO). In the process, we propose an
MIO formulation of a Sum-Product Network (SPN) and use the SPN to estimate the
likelihood of a counterfactual, which can be of independent interest. A
numerical comparison against several methods for generating counterfactual
explanations is provided.

<p>Cyber threat attribution can play an important role in increasing resilience
against digital threats. Recent research focuses on automating the threat
attribution process and on integrating it with other efforts, such as threat
hunting. To support increasing automation of the cyber threat attribution
process, this paper proposes a modular architecture as an alternative to
current monolithic automated approaches. The modular architecture can utilize
opinion pools to combine the output of concrete attributors. The proposed
solution increases the tractability of the threat attribution problem and
offers increased usability and interpretability, as opposed to monolithic
alternatives. In addition, a Pairing Aggregator is proposed as an aggregation
method that forms pairs of attributors based on distinct features to produce
intermediary results before finally producing a single Probability Mass
Function (PMF) as output. The Pairing Aggregator sequentially applies both the
logarithmic opinion pool and the linear opinion pool. An experimental
validation suggests that the modular approach does not result in decreased
performance and can even enhance precision and recall compared to monolithic
alternatives. The results also suggest that the Pairing Aggregator can improve
precision over the linear and logarithmic opinion pools. Furthermore, the
improved k-accuracy in the experiment suggests that forensic experts can
leverage the resulting PMF during their manual attribution processes to enhance
their efficiency.

<p>Due to the continuous change in operational data, AIOps solutions suffer from
performance degradation over time. Although periodic retraining is the
state-of-the-art technique to preserve the failure prediction AIOps models'
performance over time, this technique requires a considerable amount of labeled
data to retrain. In AIOps obtaining label data is expensive since it requires
the availability of domain experts to intensively annotate it. In this paper,
we present McUDI, a model-centric unsupervised degradation indicator that is
capable of detecting the exact moment the AIOps model requires retraining as a
result of changes in data. We further show how employing McUDI in the
maintenance pipeline of AIOps solutions can reduce the number of samples that
require annotations with 30k for job failure prediction and 260k for disk
failure prediction while achieving similar performance with periodic

<p>Wearable technologies enable continuous monitoring of various health metrics,
such as physical activity, heart rate, sleep, and stress levels. A key
challenge with wearable data is obtaining quality labels. Unlike modalities
like video where the videos themselves can be effectively used to label objects
or events, wearable data do not contain obvious cues about the physical
manifestation of the users and usually require rich metadata. As a result,
label noise can become an increasingly thorny issue when labeling such data. In
this paper, we propose a novel solution to address noisy label learning,
entitled Few-Shot Human-in-the-Loop Refinement (FHLR). Our method initially
learns a seed model using weak labels. Next, it fine-tunes the seed model using
a handful of expert corrections. Finally, it achieves better generalizability
and robustness by merging the seed and fine-tuned models via weighted parameter
averaging. We evaluate our approach on four challenging tasks and datasets, and
compare it against eight competitive baselines designed to deal with noisy
labels. We show that FHLR achieves significantly better performance when
learning from noisy labels and achieves state-of-the-art by a large margin,
with up to 19% accuracy improvement under symmetric and asymmetric noise.
Notably, we find that FHLR is particularly robust to increased label noise,
unlike prior works that suffer from severe performance degradation. Our work
not only achieves better generalization in high-stakes health sensing
benchmarks but also sheds light on how noise affects commonly-used models.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and LlaMA are advancing rapidly
in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), but their immense size poses
significant challenges, such as huge training and inference costs, substantial
energy demands, and limitations for on-site deployment. Traditional compression
methods such as pruning, distillation, and low-rank approximation focus on
reducing the effective number of neurons in the network, while quantization
focuses on reducing the numerical precision of individual weights to reduce the
model size while keeping the number of neurons fixed. While these compression
methods have been relatively successful in practice, there's no compelling
reason to believe that truncating the number of neurons is an optimal strategy.
In this context, this paper introduces CompactifAI, an innovative LLM
compression approach using quantum-inspired Tensor Networks that focuses on the
model's correlation space instead, allowing for a more controlled, refined and
interpretable model compression. Our method is versatile and can be implemented
with - or on top of - other compression techniques. As a benchmark, we
demonstrate that CompactifAI alone enables compression of the LlaMA-2 7B model
to only $30\%$ of its original size while recovering over $90\%$ of the
original accuracy after a brief distributed retraining.

<p>The majority of the research on the quantization of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) is focused on reducing the precision of tensors visible by high-level
frameworks (e.g., weights, activations, and gradients). However, current
hardware still relies on high-accuracy core operations. Most significant is the
operation of accumulating products. This high-precision accumulation operation
is gradually becoming the main computational bottleneck. This is because, so
far, the usage of low-precision accumulators led to a significant degradation
in performance. In this work, we present a simple method to train and fine-tune
high-end DNNs, to allow, for the first time, utilization of cheaper, $12$-bits
accumulators, with no significant degradation in accuracy. Lastly, we show that
as we decrease the accumulation precision further, using fine-grained gradient
approximations can improve the DNN accuracy.

<p>Six-bit quantization (FP6) can effectively reduce the size of large language
models (LLMs) and preserve the model quality consistently across varied
applications. However, existing systems do not provide Tensor Core support for
FP6 quantization and struggle to achieve practical performance improvements
during LLM inference. It is challenging to support FP6 quantization on GPUs due
to (1) unfriendly memory access of model weights with irregular bit-width and
(2) high runtime overhead of weight de-quantization. To address these problems,
we propose TC-FPx, the first full-stack GPU kernel design scheme with unified
Tensor Core support of float-point weights for various quantization bit-width.
We integrate TC-FPx kernel into an existing inference system, providing new
end-to-end support (called FP6-LLM) for quantized LLM inference, where better
trade-offs between inference cost and model quality are achieved. Experiments
show that FP6-LLM enables the inference of LLaMA-70b using only a single GPU,
achieving 1.69x-2.65x higher normalized inference throughput than the FP16
baseline. The source code will be publicly available soon.

their modelling capabilities for symmetric data. First, we consider the action
of a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$ and establish the equivalence
between equivariance of vector fields, symmetries of the corresponding Cauchy
problems, and equivariance of the associated NODEs. We also propose a novel
formulation of the equivariant NODEs in terms of the differential invariants of
the action of $G$ on $M$, based on Lie theory for symmetries of differential
equations, which provides an efficient parameterisation of the space of
equivariant vector fields in a way that is agnostic to both the manifold $M$
and the symmetry group $G$. Second, we construct augmented manifold NODEs,
through embeddings into equivariant flows, and show that they are universal
approximators of equivariant diffeomorphisms on any path-connected $M$.
Furthermore, we show that the augmented NODEs can be incorporated in the
geometric framework and parameterised using higher order differential
invariants. Finally, we consider the induced action of $G$ on different fields
on $M$ and show how it can be used to generalise previous work, on, e.g.,
continuous normalizing flows, to equivariant models in any geometry.

<p>Existing methods, such as concept bottleneck models (CBMs), have been
successful in providing concept-based interpretations for black-box deep
learning models. They typically work by predicting concepts given the input and
then predicting the final class label given the predicted concepts. However,
(1) they often fail to capture the high-order, nonlinear interaction between
concepts, e.g., correcting a predicted concept (e.g., "yellow breast") does not
help correct highly correlated concepts (e.g., "yellow belly"), leading to
suboptimal final accuracy; (2) they cannot naturally quantify the complex
conditional dependencies between different concepts and class labels (e.g., for
an image with the class label "Kentucky Warbler" and a concept "black bill",
what is the probability that the model correctly predicts another concept
"black crown"), therefore failing to provide deeper insight into how a
black-box model works. In response to these limitations, we propose
Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Our ECBMs use a set of neural
networks to define the joint energy of candidate (input, concept, class)
tuples. With such a unified interface, prediction, concept correction, and
conditional dependency quantification are then represented as conditional
probabilities, which are generated by composing different energy functions. Our
ECBMs address both limitations of existing CBMs, providing higher accuracy and
richer concept interpretations. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.

<p>Despite the impressive performance across numerous tasks, large language
models (LLMs) often fail in solving simple decision-making tasks due to the
misalignment of the knowledge in LLMs with environments. On the contrary,
reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn policies from scratch, which makes
them always align with environments but difficult to incorporate prior
knowledge for efficient explorations. To narrow the gap, we propose TWOSOME, a
novel general online framework that deploys LLMs as decision-making agents to
efficiently interact and align with embodied environments via RL without
requiring any prepared datasets or prior knowledge of the environments.
Firstly, we query the joint probabilities of each valid action with LLMs to
form behavior policies. Then, to enhance the stability and robustness of the
policies, we propose two normalization methods and summarize four prompt design
principles. Finally, we design a novel parameter-efficient training
architecture where the actor and critic share one frozen LLM equipped with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) updated by PPO. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate TWOSOME. i) TWOSOME exhibits significantly better sample efficiency
and performance compared to the conventional RL method, PPO, and prompt tuning
method, SayCan, in both classical decision-making environment, Overcooked, and
simulated household environment, VirtualHome. ii) Benefiting from LLMs'
open-vocabulary feature, TWOSOME shows superior generalization ability to
unseen tasks. iii) Under our framework, there is no significant loss of the
LLMs' original ability during online PPO finetuning.

<p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a challenging binary classification problem
due to its different structural distribution between anomalies and normal nodes
-- abnormal nodes are a minority, therefore holding high heterophily and low
homophily compared to normal nodes. Furthermore, due to various time factors
and the annotation preferences of human experts, the heterophily and homophily
can change across training and testing data, which is called structural
distribution shift (SDS) in this paper. The mainstream methods are built on
graph neural networks (GNNs), benefiting the classification of normals from
aggregating homophilous neighbors, yet ignoring the SDS issue for anomalies and
suffering from poor generalization.
</p>
<p>This work solves the problem from a feature view. We observe that the degree
of SDS varies between anomalies and normal nodes. Hence to address the issue,
the key lies in resisting high heterophily for anomalies meanwhile benefiting
the learning of normals from homophily. We tease out the anomaly features on
which we constrain to mitigate the effect of heterophilous neighbors and make
them invariant. We term our proposed framework as Graph Decomposition Network
(GDN). Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and the
proposed framework achieves a remarkable performance boost in GAD, especially
in an SDS environment where anomalies have largely different structural
distribution across training and testing environments. Codes are open-sourced

<p>This paper introduces a novel approach called "friendly attack" aimed at
enhancing the performance of error correction channel codes. Inspired by the
concept of adversarial attacks, our method leverages the idea of introducing
slight perturbations to the neural network input, resulting in a substantial
impact on the network's performance. By introducing small perturbations to
fixed-point modulated codewords before transmission, we effectively improve the
decoder's performance without violating the input power constraint. The
perturbation design is accomplished by a modified iterative fast gradient
method. This study investigates various decoder architectures suitable for
computing gradients to obtain the desired perturbations. Specifically, we
consider belief propagation (BP) for LDPC codes; the error correcting code
transformer, BP and neural BP (NBP) for polar codes, and neural BCJR for
convolutional codes. We demonstrate that the proposed friendly attack method
can improve the reliability across different channels, modulations, codes, and
decoders. This method allows us to increase the reliability of communication
with a legacy receiver by simply modifying the transmitted codeword
appropriately.

<p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language
processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal
forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and
complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue,
this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for
spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1)
STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph
data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2)
STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and
decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension.
By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the
semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original
natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on
diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully
unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our
approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.

integral to quantitative finance and is apt for advanced deep-learning
techniques. A pivotal challenge in pair trading is discerning temporal
correlations among entities, necessitating the integration of diverse data

<p>The most adopted definition of landslide hazard combines spatial information
about landslide location (susceptibility), threat (intensity), and frequency
(return period). Only the first two elements are usually considered and
estimated when working over vast areas. Even then, separate models constitute
the standard, with frequency being rarely investigated. Frequency and intensity
are intertwined and depend on each other because larger events occur less
frequently and vice versa. However, due to the lack of multi-temporal
inventories and joint statistical models, modelling such properties via a
unified hazard model has always been challenging and has yet to be attempted.
Here, we develop a unified model to estimate landslide hazard at the slope unit
level to address such gaps. We employed deep learning, combined with a model
motivated by extreme-value theory to analyse an inventory of 30 years of
observed rainfall-triggered landslides in Nepal and assess landslide hazard for
multiple return periods. We also use our model to further explore landslide
hazard for the same return periods under different climate change scenarios up
to the end of the century. Our results show that the proposed model performs
excellently and can be used to model landslide hazard in a unified manner.
Geomorphologically, we find that under both climate change scenarios (SSP245
and SSP885), landslide hazard is likely to increase up to two times on average
in the lower Himalayan regions while remaining the same in the middle Himalayan
region whilst decreasing slightly in the upper Himalayan region areas.

<p>Federated Learning (FL) is a promising technique for the collaborative
training of deep neural networks across multiple devices while preserving data
privacy. Despite its potential benefits, FL is hindered by excessive
communication costs due to repeated server-client communication during
training. To address this challenge, model compression techniques, such as
sparsification and weight clustering are applied, which often require modifying
the underlying model aggregation schemes or involve cumbersome hyperparameter
tuning, with the latter not only adjusts the model's compression rate but also
limits model's potential for continuous improvement over growing data. In this
paper, we propose FedCompress, a novel approach that combines dynamic weight
clustering and server-side knowledge distillation to reduce communication costs
while learning highly generalizable models. Through a comprehensive evaluation
on diverse public datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
compared to baselines in terms of communication costs and inference speed. We
will make our implementation public upon acceptance.

<p>Improving sample efficiency is central to Reinforcement Learning (RL),
especially in environments where the rewards are sparse. Some recent approaches
have proposed to specify reward functions as manually designed or learned
reward structures whose integrations in the RL algorithms are claimed to
significantly improve the learning efficiency. Manually designed reward
structures can suffer from inaccuracy and existing automatically learning
methods are often computationally intractable for complex tasks. The
integration of inaccurate or partial reward structures in RL algorithms fail to
learn optimal policies. In this work, we propose an RL algorithm that can
automatically structure the reward function for sample efficiency, given a set
of labels that signify subtasks. Given such minimal knowledge about the task,
we train a high-level policy that selects optimal sub-tasks in each state
together with a low-level policy that efficiently learns to complete each
sub-task. We evaluate our algorithm in a variety of sparse-reward environments.
The experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-art baselines as the difficulty of the task increases.

<p>As the cost of training ever larger language models has grown, so has the
interest in reusing previously learnt knowledge. Transfer learning methods have
shown how reusing non-task-specific knowledge can help in subsequent
task-specific learning. In this paper, we investigate the inverse: porting
whole functional modules that encode task-specific knowledge from one model to
another. We designed a study comprising 1,440 training/testing runs to test the
portability of modules trained by parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
techniques, using sentiment analysis as an example task. We test portability in
a wide range of scenarios, involving different PEFT techniques and different
pretrained host models, among other dimensions. We compare the performance of
ported modules with that of equivalent modules trained (i) from scratch, and
(ii) from parameters sampled from the same distribution as the ported module.
We find that the ported modules far outperform the two alternatives tested, but
that there are interesting performance differences between the four PEFT
techniques. We conclude that task-specific knowledge in the form of
structurally modular sets of parameters as produced by PEFT techniques is
highly portable, but that degree of success depends on type of PEFT and on
differences between originating and receiving pretrained models.

<p>This study developed a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based defense
method for traffic sign classification in an autonomous vehicle (AV), referred
to as the attack-resilient GAN (AR-GAN). The novelty of the AR-GAN lies in (i)
assuming zero knowledge of adversarial attack models and samples and (ii)
providing consistently high traffic sign classification performance under
various adversarial attack types. The AR-GAN classification system consists of
a generator that denoises an image by reconstruction, and a classifier that
classifies the reconstructed image. The authors have tested the AR-GAN under
no-attack and under various adversarial attacks, such as Fast Gradient Sign
Method (FGSM), DeepFool, Carlini and Wagner (C&amp;W), and Projected Gradient
Descent (PGD). The authors considered two forms of these attacks, i.e., (i)
black-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess no prior knowledge of the
classifier), and (ii) white-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess full
knowledge of the classifier). The classification performance of the AR-GAN was
compared with several benchmark adversarial defense methods. The results showed
that both the AR-GAN and the benchmark defense methods are resilient against
black-box attacks and could achieve similar classification performance to that
of the unperturbed images. However, for all the white-box attacks considered in
this study, the AR-GAN method outperformed the benchmark defense methods. In
addition, the AR-GAN was able to maintain its high classification performance
under varied white-box adversarial perturbation magnitudes, whereas the
performance of the other defense methods dropped abruptly at increased

conditions to control. Experts can detect its severity early using the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire, administer appropriate medication to
patients, and impede its progression. Due to the fear of potential
stigmatization, many patients turn to social media platforms like Reddit for

<p>Medical imaging diagnosis increasingly relies on Machine Learning (ML)
models. This is a task that is often hampered by severely imbalanced datasets,
where positive cases can be quite rare. Their use is further compromised by
their limited interpretability, which is becoming increasingly important. While
post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with
some success on so-called black box models, the use of inherently
understandable models makes such endeavors more fruitful. This paper addresses
these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation
technique, STEM, can be used to produce data to train models produced by
Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a
recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling
Technique (SMOTE), Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN), and Mixup; it has previously
been successfully used to tackle both between class and within class imbalance
issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography
(DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets and compare Area Under
the Curve (AUC) results with an ensemble of the top three performing
classifiers from a set of eight standard ML classifiers with varying degrees of
interpretability. We demonstrate that the GE-derived models present the best
AUC while still maintaining interpretable solutions.

<p>Modern plankton high-throughput monitoring relies on deep learning
classifiers for species recognition in water ecosystems. Despite satisfactory
nominal performances, a significant challenge arises from Dataset Shift, which
causes performances to drop during deployment. In our study, we integrate the
ZooLake dataset with manually-annotated images from 10 independent days of
deployment, serving as test cells to benchmark Out-Of-Dataset (OOD)
performances. Our analysis reveals instances where classifiers, initially
performing well in In-Dataset conditions, encounter notable failures in
practical scenarios. For example, a MobileNet with a 92% nominal test accuracy
shows a 77% OOD accuracy. We systematically investigate conditions leading to
OOD performance drops and propose a preemptive assessment method to identify
potential pitfalls when classifying new data, and pinpoint features in OOD
images that adversely impact classification. We present a three-step pipeline:
(i) identifying OOD degradation compared to nominal test performance, (ii)
conducting a diagnostic analysis of degradation causes, and (iii) providing
solutions. We find that ensembles of BEiT vision transformers, with targeted
augmentations addressing OOD robustness, geometric ensembling, and
rotation-based test-time augmentation, constitute the most robust model, which
we call BEsT model. It achieves an 83% OOD accuracy, with errors concentrated
on container classes. Moreover, it exhibits lower sensitivity to dataset shift,
and reproduces well the plankton abundances. Our proposed pipeline is
applicable to generic plankton classifiers, contingent on the availability of
suitable test cells. By identifying critical shortcomings and offering
practical procedures to fortify models against dataset shift, our study
contributes to the development of more reliable plankton classification
technologies.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14283">Information Leakage Detection through Approximate Bayes-optimal Prediction. (arXiv:2401.14283v1 [stat.ML])</a></h1>

<p>In today's data-driven world, the proliferation of publicly available
information intensifies the challenge of information leakage (IL), raising
security concerns. IL involves unintentionally exposing secret (sensitive)
information to unauthorized parties via systems' observable information.
Conventional statistical approaches, which estimate mutual information (MI)
between observable and secret information for detecting IL, face challenges
such as the curse of dimensionality, convergence, computational complexity, and
MI misestimation. Furthermore, emerging supervised machine learning (ML)
methods, though effective, are limited to binary system-sensitive information
and lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. To address these limitations,
we establish a theoretical framework using statistical learning theory and
information theory to accurately quantify and detect IL. We demonstrate that MI
can be accurately estimated by approximating the log-loss and accuracy of the
Bayes predictor. As the Bayes predictor is typically unknown in practice, we
propose to approximate it with the help of automated machine learning (AutoML).
First, we compare our MI estimation approaches against current baselines, using
synthetic data sets generated using the multivariate normal (MVN) distribution
with known MI. Second, we introduce a cut-off technique using one-sided
statistical tests to detect IL, employing the Holm-Bonferroni correction to
increase confidence in detection decisions. Our study evaluates IL detection
performance on real-world data sets, highlighting the effectiveness of the
Bayes predictor's log-loss estimation, and finds our proposed method to
effectively estimate MI on synthetic data sets and thus detect ILs accurately.

<p>Speech foundation models (SFMs) have been benchmarked on many speech
processing tasks, often achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal
adaptation. However, the SFM paradigm has been significantly less explored for
applications of interest to the speech perception community. In this paper we
present a systematic evaluation of 10 SFMs on one such application: Speech
intelligibility prediction. We focus on the non-intrusive setup of the Clarity
Prediction Challenge 2 (CPC2), where the task is to predict the percentage of
words correctly perceived by hearing-impaired listeners from speech-in-noise
recordings. We propose a simple method that learns a lightweight specialized
prediction head on top of frozen SFMs to approach the problem. Our results
reveal statistically significant differences in performance across SFMs. Our
method resulted in the winning submission in the CPC2, demonstrating its
promise for speech perception applications.

<p>The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant
progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language
models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these,
prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm,
with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts,
in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As
illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the
LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical
reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of
this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a
general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this,
we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying
and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of
structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental
classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these
structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We
refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation
becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our
study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy,
discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance
and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between
prompting and others parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and
the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt
engineering techniques.

<p>In the age of digital music streaming, playlists on platforms like Spotify
have become an integral part of individuals' musical experiences. People create
and publicly share their own playlists to express their musical tastes, promote
the discovery of their favorite artists, and foster social connections. These
publicly accessible playlists transcend the boundaries of mere musical
preferences: they serve as sources of rich insights into users' attributes and
identities. For example, the musical preferences of elderly individuals may
lean more towards Frank Sinatra, while Billie Eilish remains a favored choice
among teenagers. These playlists thus become windows into the diverse and
evolving facets of one's musical identity.
</p>
<p>In this work, we investigate the relationship between Spotify users'
attributes and their public playlists. In particular, we focus on identifying
recurring musical characteristics associated with users' individual attributes,
such as demographics, habits, or personality traits. To this end, we conducted
an online survey involving 739 Spotify users, yielding a dataset of 10,286
publicly shared playlists encompassing over 200,000 unique songs and 55,000
artists. Through extensive statistical analyses, we first assess a deep
connection between a user's Spotify playlists and their real-life attributes.
For instance, we found individuals high in openness often create playlists
featuring a diverse array of artists, while female users prefer Pop and K-pop
music genres. Building upon these observed associations, we create accurate
predictive models for users' attributes, presenting a novel DeepSet application
that outperforms baselines in most of these users' attributes.

<p>With an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices present in
homes, there is a rise in the number of potential information leakage channels
and their associated security threats and privacy risks. Despite a long history
of attacks on IoT devices in unprotected home networks, the problem of
accurate, rapid detection and prevention of such attacks remains open. Many
existing IoT protection solutions are cloud-based, sometimes ineffective, and
might share consumer data with unknown third parties. This paper investigates
the potential for effective IoT threat detection locally, on a home router,
using AI tools combined with classic rule-based traffic-filtering algorithms.
Our results show that with a slight rise of router hardware resources caused by
machine learning and traffic filtering logic, a typical home router
instrumented with our solution is able to effectively detect risks and protect
a typical home IoT network, equaling or outperforming existing popular
solutions, without any effects on benign IoT functionality, and without relying
on cloud services and third parties.

<p>We propose a novel algorithm for the support estimation of partially known
Gaussian graphical models that incorporates prior information about the
underlying graph. In contrast to classical approaches that provide a point
estimate based on a maximum likelihood or a maximum a posteriori criterion
using (simple) priors on the precision matrix, we consider a prior on the graph
and rely on annealed Langevin diffusion to generate samples from the posterior
distribution. Since the Langevin sampler requires access to the score function
of the underlying graph prior, we use graph neural networks to effectively
estimate the score from a graph dataset (either available beforehand or
generated from a known distribution). Numerical experiments demonstrate the
benefits of our approach.

<p>Modern classification problems exhibit heterogeneities across individual
classes: Each class may have unique attributes, such as sample size, label
quality, or predictability (easy vs difficult), and variable importance at
test-time. Without care, these heterogeneities impede the learning process,
most notably, when optimizing fairness objectives. Confirming this, under a
gaussian mixture setting, we show that the optimal SVM classifier for balanced
accuracy needs to be adaptive to the class attributes. This motivates us to
propose CAP: An effective and general method that generates a class-specific
learning strategy (e.g. hyperparameter) based on the attributes of that class.
This way, optimization process better adapts to heterogeneities. CAP leads to
substantial improvements over the naive approach of assigning separate
hyperparameters to each class. We instantiate CAP for loss function design and
post-hoc logit adjustment, with emphasis on label-imbalanced problems. We show
that CAP is competitive with prior art and its flexibility unlocks clear
benefits for fairness objectives beyond balanced accuracy. Finally, we evaluate
CAP on problems with label noise as well as weighted test objectives to
showcase how CAP can jointly adapt to different heterogeneities.

<p>This paper presents ServerlessLLM, a locality-enhanced serverless inference
system for Large Language Models (LLMs). ServerlessLLM exploits the substantial
capacity and bandwidth of storage and memory devices available on GPU servers,
thereby reducing costly remote checkpoint downloads and achieving efficient
checkpoint loading. ServerlessLLM achieves this through three main
contributions: (i) fast LLM checkpoint loading via a novel loading-optimized
checkpoint format design, coupled with an efficient multi-tier checkpoint
loading system; (ii) locality-driven LLM inference with live migration, which
allows ServerlessLLM to effectively achieve locality-driven server allocation
while preserving the low latency of ongoing LLM inference; and (iii)
locality-aware server allocation, enabling ServerlessLLM to evaluate the status
of each server in a cluster and effectively schedule model startup time to
capitalize on local checkpoint placement. Our comprehensive experiments, which
include microbenchmarks and real-world traces, show that ServerlessLLM
surpasses state-of-the-art systems by 10 - 200X in latency performance when
running various LLM inference workloads.

In a human evaluation, our generated data was found to be natural and of high

<p>In contemporary design practices, the integration of computer vision and
generative artificial intelligence (genAI) represents a transformative shift
towards more interactive and inclusive processes. These technologies offer new
dimensions of image analysis and generation, which are particularly relevant in
the context of urban landscape reconstruction. This paper presents a novel
workflow encapsulated within a prototype application, designed to leverage the
synergies between advanced image segmentation and diffusion models for a
comprehensive approach to urban design. Our methodology encompasses the
OneFormer model for detailed image segmentation and the Stable Diffusion XL
(SDXL) diffusion model, implemented through ControlNet, for generating images
from textual descriptions. Validation results indicated a high degree of
performance by the prototype application, showcasing significant accuracy in
both object detection and text-to-image generation. This was evidenced by
superior Intersection over Union (IoU) and CLIP scores across iterative
evaluations for various categories of urban landscape features. Preliminary
testing included utilising UrbanGenAI as an educational tool enhancing the
learning experience in design pedagogy, and as a participatory instrument
facilitating community-driven urban planning. Early results suggested that
UrbanGenAI not only advances the technical frontiers of urban landscape
reconstruction but also provides significant pedagogical and participatory
planning benefits. The ongoing development of UrbanGenAI aims to further
validate its effectiveness across broader contexts and integrate additional
features such as real-time feedback mechanisms and 3D modelling capabilities.

equation, we construct a diffusion layer that can be applied to an arbitrary

our general setting. Both layers are equivariant with respect to node
permutations and isometries of the feature manifold. These properties have been
shown to lead to a beneficial inductive bias in many deep learning tasks.

<p>The most popular classification algorithms are designed to maximize
classification accuracy during training. However, this strategy may fail in the
presence of class imbalance since it is possible to train models with high
accuracy by overfitting to the majority class. On the other hand, the Area
Under the Curve (AUC) is a widely used metric to compare classification
performance of different algorithms when there is a class imbalance, and
various approaches focusing on the direct optimization of this metric during
training have been proposed. Among them, SVM-based formulations are especially
popular as this formulation allows incorporating different regularization
strategies easily. In this work, we develop a prototype learning approach that
relies on cutting-plane method, similar to Ranking SVM, to maximize AUC. Our
algorithm learns simpler models by iteratively introducing cutting planes, thus
overfitting is prevented in an unconventional way. Furthermore, it penalizes
the changes in the weights at each iteration to avoid large jumps that might be
observed in the test performance, thus facilitating a smooth learning process.
Based on the experiments conducted on 73 binary classification datasets, our
method yields the best test AUC in 25 datasets among its relevant competitors.

<p>We introduce pix2gestalt, a framework for zero-shot amodal segmentation,
which learns to estimate the shape and appearance of whole objects that are
only partially visible behind occlusions. By capitalizing on large-scale
diffusion models and transferring their representations to this task, we learn
a conditional diffusion model for reconstructing whole objects in challenging
zero-shot cases, including examples that break natural and physical priors,
such as art. As training data, we use a synthetically curated dataset
containing occluded objects paired with their whole counterparts. Experiments
show that our approach outperforms supervised baselines on established
benchmarks. Our model can furthermore be used to significantly improve the
performance of existing object recognition and 3D reconstruction methods in the

<p>Deploying robots in open-ended unstructured environments such as homes has
been a long-standing research problem. However, robots are often studied only
in closed-off lab settings, and prior mobile manipulation work is restricted to
pick-move-place, which is arguably just the tip of the iceberg in this area. In
this paper, we introduce Open-World Mobile Manipulation System, a full-stack
approach to tackle realistic articulated object operation, e.g. real-world
doors, cabinets, drawers, and refrigerators in open-ended unstructured
environments. The robot utilizes an adaptive learning framework to initially
learns from a small set of data through behavior cloning, followed by learning
from online practice on novel objects that fall outside the training
distribution. We also develop a low-cost mobile manipulation hardware platform
capable of safe and autonomous online adaptation in unstructured environments
with a cost of around 20,000 USD. In our experiments we utilize 20 articulate
objects across 4 buildings in the CMU campus. With less than an hour of online
learning for each object, the system is able to increase success rate from 50%
of BC pre-training to 95% using online adaptation. Video results at

<p>In this study, we examine the representation learning abilities of Denoising
Diffusion Models (DDM) that were originally purposed for image generation. Our
philosophy is to deconstruct a DDM, gradually transforming it into a classical
Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). This deconstructive procedure allows us to explore
how various components of modern DDMs influence self-supervised representation
learning. We observe that only a very few modern components are critical for
learning good representations, while many others are nonessential. Our study
ultimately arrives at an approach that is highly simplified and to a large
extent resembles a classical DAE. We hope our study will rekindle interest in a
family of classical methods within the realm of modern self-supervised

<p>We propose to improve transformers of a specific modality with irrelevant
data from other modalities, e.g., improve an ImageNet model with audio or point
cloud datasets. We would like to highlight that the data samples of the target
modality are irrelevant to the other modalities, which distinguishes our method
from other works utilizing paired (e.g., CLIP) or interleaved data of different
modalities. We propose a methodology named Multimodal Pathway - given a target
modality and a transformer designed for it, we use an auxiliary transformer
trained with data of another modality and construct pathways to connect
components of the two models so that data of the target modality can be
processed by both models. In this way, we utilize the universal
sequence-to-sequence modeling abilities of transformers obtained from two
modalities. As a concrete implementation, we use a modality-specific tokenizer
and task-specific head as usual but utilize the transformer blocks of the
auxiliary model via a proposed method named Cross-Modal Re-parameterization,
which exploits the auxiliary weights without any inference costs. On the image,
point cloud, video, and audio recognition tasks, we observe significant and
consistent performance improvements with irrelevant data from other modalities.

<p>This paper studies stochastic control problems with the action space taken to
be probability measures, with the objective penalised by the relative entropy.
We identify suitable metric space on which we construct a gradient flow for the
measure-valued control process, in the set of admissible controls, along which
the cost functional is guaranteed to decrease. It is shown that any invariant
measure of this gradient flow satisfies the Pontryagin optimality principle. If
the problem we work with is sufficiently convex, the gradient flow converges
exponentially fast. Furthermore, the optimal measure-valued control process
admits a Bayesian interpretation which means that one can incorporate prior
knowledge when solving such stochastic control problems. This work is motivated
by a desire to extend the theoretical underpinning for the convergence of
stochastic gradient type algorithms widely employed in the reinforcement
learning community to solve control problems.

<p>A real-world graph has a complex topological structure, which is often formed
by the interaction of different latent factors. However, most existing methods
lack consideration of the intrinsic differences in relations between nodes
caused by factor entanglement. In this paper, we propose an
\underline{\textbf{A}}dversarial \underline{\textbf{D}}isentangled
\underline{\textbf{G}}raph \underline{\textbf{C}}onvolutional
\underline{\textbf{N}}etwork (ADGCN) for disentangled graph representation
learning. To begin with, we point out two aspects of graph disentanglement that
need to be considered, i.e., micro-disentanglement and macro-disentanglement.
For them, a component-specific aggregation approach is proposed to achieve
micro-disentanglement by inferring latent components that cause the links
between nodes. On the basis of micro-disentanglement, we further propose a
macro-disentanglement adversarial regularizer to improve the separability among
component distributions, thus restricting the interdependence among components.
Additionally, to reveal the topological graph structure, a diversity-preserving
node sampling approach is proposed, by which the graph structure can be
progressively refined in a way of local structure awareness. The experimental
results on various real-world graph data verify that our ADGCN obtains more
favorable performance over currently available alternatives. The source codes

<p>How many different binary classification problems a single learning algorithm
can solve on a fixed data with exactly zero or at most a given number of
cross-validation errors? While the number in the former case is known to be
limited by the no-free-lunch theorem, we show that the exact answers are given
by the theory of error detecting codes. As a case study, we focus on the AUC
performance measure and leave-pair-out cross-validation (LPOCV), in which every
possible pair of data with different class labels is held out at a time. We
shown that the maximal number of classification problems with fixed class
proportion, for which a learning algorithm can achieve zero LPOCV error, equals
the maximal number of code words in a constant weight code (CWC), with certain
technical properties. We then generalize CWCs by introducing light CWCs and
prove an analogous result for nonzero LPOCV errors and light CWCs. Moreover, we
prove both upper and lower bounds on the maximal numbers of code words in light
CWCs. Finally, as an immediate practical application, we develop new LPOCV
based randomization tests for learning algorithms that generalize the classical
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test.

and the number of function value estimation is bounded by

<p>Over the last decade, researchers have extensively explored the
vulnerabilities of Android malware detectors to adversarial examples through
the development of evasion attacks; however, the practicality of these attacks
in real-world scenarios remains arguable. The majority of studies have assumed
attackers know the details of the target classifiers used for malware
detection, while in reality, malicious actors have limited access to the target
classifiers. This paper introduces EvadeDroid, a problem-space adversarial
attack designed to effectively evade black-box Android malware detectors in
real-world scenarios. EvadeDroid constructs a collection of problem-space
transformations derived from benign donors that share opcode-level similarity
with malware apps by leveraging an n-gram-based approach. These transformations
are then used to morph malware instances into benign ones via an iterative and
incremental manipulation strategy. The proposed manipulation technique is a
query-efficient optimization algorithm that can find and inject optimal
sequences of transformations into malware apps. Our empirical evaluations,
carried out on 1K malware apps, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in generating real-world adversarial examples in both soft- and hard-label
settings. Our findings reveal that EvadeDroid can effectively deceive diverse
malware detectors that utilize different features with various feature types.
Specifically, EvadeDroid achieves evasion rates of 80%-95% against DREBIN,
Sec-SVM, ADE-MA, MaMaDroid, and Opcode-SVM with only 1-9 queries. Furthermore,
we show that the proposed problem-space adversarial attack is able to preserve
its stealthiness against five popular commercial antiviruses with an average of
79% evasion rate, thus demonstrating its feasibility in the real world.

<p>We introduce MCCE: Monte Carlo sampling of valid and realistic Counterfactual
Explanations for tabular data, a novel counterfactual explanation method that
generates on-manifold, actionable and valid counterfactuals by modeling the
joint distribution of the mutable features given the immutable features and the
decision. Unlike other on-manifold methods that tend to rely on variational
autoencoders and have strict prediction model and data requirements, MCCE
handles any type of prediction model and categorical features with more than
two levels. MCCE first models the joint distribution of the features and the
decision with an autoregressive generative model where the conditionals are
estimated using decision trees. Then, it samples a large set of observations
from this model, and finally, it removes the samples that do not obey certain
criteria. We compare MCCE with a range of state-of-the-art on-manifold
counterfactual methods using four well-known data sets and show that MCCE
outperforms these methods on all common performance metrics and speed. In
particular, including the decision in the modeling process improves the
efficiency of the method substantially.

theory as a mathematical foundation for machine learning. We systematically
examine a powerful and rich class of alternative aggregation functionals, known
variously as spectral risk measures, Choquet integrals or Lorentz norms. We
present a range of characterization results, and demonstrate what makes this
spectral family so special. In doing so we arrive at a natural stratification

<p>Recently, deep auto-encoders have been used for the task of anomaly detection
in the visual domain. By optimising for the reconstruction error using
anomaly-free examples, the common belief is that a corresponding network should
fail to accurately reconstruct anomalous regions in the application phase. This
goal is typically addressed by controlling the capacity of the network, either
by reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or by enforcing sparsity
constraints on its activations. However, neither of these techniques does
explicitly penalise reconstruction of anomalous signals often resulting in poor
detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a self-supervised learning regime
that allows the use of discriminative information during training but focuses
on the data manifold of normal examples. Precisely, we investigate two
different training objectives inspired by the task of neural image inpainting.
Our main objective regularises the model to produce locally consistent
reconstructions, while replacing irregularities, therefore, acting as a filter
that removes anomalous patterns. Our formal analysis shows that under mild
conditions the corresponding model resembles a non-linear orthogonal projection
of partially corrupted images onto the manifold of uncorrupted (defect-free)
examples. This insight makes the reconstruction error a natural choice for
defining the anomaly score of a sample according to its distance from a
corresponding projection on the data manifold. We emphasise that inference with
our approach is very efficient during training and prediction requiring a
single forward pass for each input image. Our experiments on the MVTec AD
dataset demonstrate high detection and localisation performance. On the
texture-subset, in particular, our approach consistently outperforms recent
anomaly detection methods by a significant margin.

<p>In this paper, we consider topological featurizations of data defined over
simplicial complexes, like images and labeled graphs, obtained by convolving
this data with various filters before computing persistence. Viewing a
convolution filter as a local motif, the persistence diagram of the resulting
convolution describes the way the motif is distributed across the simplicial
complex. This pipeline, which we call convolutional persistence, extends the
capacity of topology to observe patterns in such data. Moreover, we prove that
(generically speaking) for any two labeled complexes one can find some filter
for which they produce different persistence diagrams, so that the collection
of all possible convolutional persistence diagrams is an injective invariant.
This is proven by showing convolutional persistence to be a special case of
another topological invariant, the Persistent Homology Transform. Other
advantages of convolutional persistence are improved stability, greater
flexibility for data-dependent vectorizations, and reduced computational
complexity for certain data types. Additionally, we have a suite of experiments
showing that convolutions greatly improve the predictive power of persistence
on a host of classification tasks, even if one uses random filters and
vectorizes the resulting diagrams by recording only their total persistences.

<p>We study the regret guarantee for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning
(RSRL) via distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. In particular,
we consider finite episodic Markov decision processes whose objective is the
entropic risk measure (EntRM) of return. By leveraging a key property of the
EntRM, the independence property, we establish the risk-sensitive
distributional dynamic programming framework. We then propose two novel DRL
algorithms that implement optimism through two different schemes, including a
model-free one and a model-based one.
</p>
<p>We prove that they both attain $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\exp(|\beta|

represent the number of states, actions, episodes, and the time horizon,

novel distributional analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
regret analysis that bridges DRL and RSRL in terms of sample complexity.

<p>Estimates of individual treatment effects from networked observational data
are attracting increasing attention these days. One major challenge in network
scenarios is the violation of the stable unit treatment value assumption
(SUTVA), which assumes that the treatment assignment of a unit does not
influence others' outcomes. In network data, due to interference, the outcome
of a unit is influenced not only by its treatment (i.e., direct effects) but
also by others' treatments (i.e., spillover effects). Furthermore, the
influences from other units are always heterogeneous (e.g., friends with
similar interests affect a person differently than friends with different
interests). In this paper, we focus on the problem of estimating individual
treatment effects (both direct and spillover effects) under heterogeneous
interference. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Weighting
Regression (DWR) algorithm by simultaneously learning attention weights that
capture the heterogeneous interference and sample weights to eliminate the
complex confounding bias in networks. We formulate the entire learning process
as a bi-level optimization problem. In theory, we present generalization error
bounds for individual treatment effect estimation. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DWR algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for estimating individual treatment effects under
heterogeneous interference.

<p>Implicit neural representations (INRs) are a rapidly growing research field,
which provides alternative ways to represent multimedia signals. Recent
applications of INRs include image super-resolution, compression of
high-dimensional signals, or 3D rendering. However, these solutions usually
focus on visual data, and adapting them to the audio domain is not trivial.
Moreover, it requires a separately trained model for every data sample. To
address this limitation, we propose HyperSound, a meta-learning method
leveraging hypernetworks to produce INRs for audio signals unseen at training
time. We show that our approach can reconstruct sound waves with quality
comparable to other state-of-the-art models.

<p>Motivated by a range of applications, we study in this paper the problem of
transfer learning for nonparametric contextual multi-armed bandits under the
covariate shift model, where we have data collected on source bandits before
the start of the target bandit learning. The minimax rate of convergence for
the cumulative regret is established and a novel transfer learning algorithm
that attains the minimax regret is proposed. The results quantify the
contribution of the data from the source domains for learning in the target
domain in the context of nonparametric contextual multi-armed bandits.
</p>
<p>In view of the general impossibility of adaptation to unknown smoothness, we
develop a data-driven algorithm that achieves near-optimal statistical
guarantees (up to a logarithmic factor) while automatically adapting to the
unknown parameters over a large collection of parameter spaces under an
additional self-similarity assumption. A simulation study is carried out to
illustrate the benefits of utilizing the data from the auxiliary source domains
for learning in the target domain.

<p>Today's software is bloated with both code and features that are not used by
most users. This bloat is prevalent across the entire software stack, from
operating systems and applications to containers. Containers are lightweight
virtualization technologies used to package code and dependencies, providing
portable, reproducible and isolated environments. For their ease of use, data
scientists often utilize machine learning containers to simplify their
workflow. However, this convenience comes at a cost: containers are often
bloated with unnecessary code and dependencies, resulting in very large sizes.
In this paper, we analyze and quantify bloat in machine learning containers. We
develop MMLB, a framework for analyzing bloat in software systems, focusing on
machine learning containers. MMLB measures the amount of bloat at both the
container and package levels, quantifying the sources of bloat. In addition,
MMLB integrates with vulnerability analysis tools and performs package
dependency analysis to evaluate the impact of bloat on container
vulnerabilities. Through experimentation with 15 machine learning containers
from TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Nvidia, we show that bloat accounts for up to 80%
of machine learning container sizes, increasing container provisioning times by
up to 370% and exacerbating vulnerabilities by up to 99%.

<p>Passenger request prediction is essential for operations planning, control,
and management in ride-sharing platforms. While the demand prediction problem
has been studied extensively, the Origin-Destination (OD) flow prediction of
passengers has received less attention from the research community. This paper
develops a Graph Neural Network framework along with the Attention Mechanism to
predict the OD flow of passengers. The proposed framework exploits various
linear and non-linear dependencies that arise among requests originating from
different locations and captures the repetition pattern and the contextual data
of that place. Moreover, the optimal size of the grid cell that covers the road
network and preserves the complexity and accuracy of the model is determined.
Extensive simulations are conducted to examine the characteristics of our
proposed approach and its various components. The results show the superior
performance of our proposed model compared to the existing baselines.

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly used in the medical
domain. However, as medical data is highly sensitive, special precautions to
ensure its protection are required. The gold standard for privacy preservation
is the introduction of differential privacy (DP) to model training. Prior work
indicates that DP has negative implications on model accuracy and fairness,
which are unacceptable in medicine and represent a main barrier to the
widespread use of privacy-preserving techniques. In this work, we evaluated the
effect of privacy-preserving training of AI models regarding accuracy and
fairness compared to non-private training. For this, we used two datasets: (1)
A large dataset (N=193,311) of high quality clinical chest radiographs, and (2)
a dataset (N=1,625) of 3D abdominal computed tomography (CT) images, with the
task of classifying the presence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Both were retrospectively collected and manually labeled by experienced
radiologists. We then compared non-private deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and privacy-preserving (DP) models with respect to privacy-utility
trade-offs measured as area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve
(AUROC), and privacy-fairness trade-offs, measured as Pearson's r or
Statistical Parity Difference. We found that, while the privacy-preserving
trainings yielded lower accuracy, they did largely not amplify discrimination
against age, sex or co-morbidity. Our study shows that -- under the challenging
realistic circumstances of a real-life clinical dataset -- the
privacy-preserving training of diagnostic deep learning models is possible with
excellent diagnostic accuracy and fairness.

<p>Randomized smoothing is a leading approach for constructing classifiers that
are certifiably robust against adversarial examples. Existing work on
randomized smoothing has focused on classifiers with continuous inputs, such as
images, where $\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries are commonly studied. However,
there has been limited work for classifiers with discrete or variable-size
inputs, such as for source code, which require different threat models and
smoothing mechanisms. In this work, we adapt randomized smoothing for discrete
sequence classifiers to provide certified robustness against edit
distance-bounded adversaries. Our proposed smoothing mechanism randomized
deletion (RS-Del) applies random deletion edits, which are (perhaps
surprisingly) sufficient to confer robustness against adversarial deletion,
insertion and substitution edits. Our proof of certification deviates from the
established Neyman-Pearson approach, which is intractable in our setting, and
is instead organized around longest common subsequences. We present a case
study on malware detection--a binary classification problem on byte sequences
where classifier evasion is a well-established threat model. When applied to
the popular MalConv malware detection model, our smoothing mechanism RS-Del
achieves a certified accuracy of 91% at an edit distance radius of 128 bytes.

<p>Within medical imaging segmentation, the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff-based
metrics are standard measures of success for deep learning models. However,
modern loss functions for medical image segmentation often only consider the
Dice coefficient or similar region-based metrics during training. As a result,
segmentation architectures trained over such loss functions run the risk of
achieving high accuracy for the Dice coefficient but low accuracy for
Hausdorff-based metrics. Low accuracy on Hausdorff-based metrics can be
problematic for applications such as tumor segmentation, where such benchmarks
are crucial. For example, high Dice scores accompanied by significant Hausdorff
errors could indicate that the predictions fail to detect small tumors. We
propose the Generalized Surface Loss function, a novel loss function to
minimize Hausdorff-based metrics with more desirable numerical properties than
current methods and with weighting terms for class imbalance. Our loss function
outperforms other losses when tested on the LiTS and BraTS datasets using the
state-of-the-art nnUNet architecture. These results suggest we can improve
medical imaging segmentation accuracy with our novel loss function.

<p>The $K$-armed dueling bandits problem, where the feedback is in the form of
noisy pairwise preferences, has been widely studied due its applications in
information retrieval, recommendation systems, etc. Motivated by concerns that
user preferences/tastes can evolve over time, we consider the problem of
dueling bandits with distribution shifts. Specifically, we study the recent
notion of significant shifts (Suk and Kpotufe, 2022), and ask whether one can
design an adaptive algorithm for the dueling problem with
$O(\sqrt{K\tilde{L}T})$ dynamic regret, where $\tilde{L}$ is the (unknown)
number of significant shifts in preferences. We show that the answer to this
question depends on the properties of underlying preference distributions.
</p>
<p>Firstly, we give an impossibility result that rules out any algorithm with
$O(\sqrt{K\tilde{L}T})$ dynamic regret under the well-studied Condorcet and SST
classes of preference distributions. Secondly, we show that $\text{SST} \cap
\text{STI}$ is the largest amongst popular classes of preference distributions
where it is possible to design such an algorithm. Overall, our results provides
an almost complete resolution of the above question for the hierarchy of
distribution classes.

flexibility in the type of feedback that a user/annotator can provide,

<p>Post-training Neural Network (NN) model compression is an attractive approach
for deploying large, memory-consuming models on devices with limited memory
resources. In this study, we investigate the rate-distortion tradeoff for NN
model compression. First, we suggest a Rotation-Invariant Quantization (RIQ)
technique that utilizes a single parameter to quantize the entire NN model,
yielding a different rate at each layer, i.e., mixed-precision quantization.
Then, we prove that our rotation-invariant approach is optimal in terms of
compression. We rigorously evaluate RIQ and demonstrate its capabilities on
various models and tasks. For example, RIQ facilitates $\times 19.4$ and
$\times 52.9$ compression ratios on pre-trained VGG dense and pruned models,
respectively, with $&lt;0.4\%$ accuracy degradation. Code is available in

<p>Soft robots are gaining popularity thanks to their intrinsic safety to
contacts and adaptability. However, the potentially infinite number of Degrees
of Freedom makes their modeling a daunting task, and in many cases only an
approximated description is available. This challenge makes reinforcement
learning (RL) based approaches inefficient when deployed on a realistic
scenario, due to the large domain gap between models and the real platform. In
this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, how Domain Randomization (DR)
can solve this problem by enhancing RL policies for soft robots with: i)
robustness w.r.t. unknown dynamics parameters; ii) reduced training times by
exploiting drastically simpler dynamic models for learning; iii) better
environment exploration, which can lead to exploitation of environmental
constraints for optimal performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithmic
extension to previous adaptive domain randomization methods for the automatic
inference of dynamics parameters for deformable objects. We provide an
extensive evaluation in simulation on four different tasks and two soft robot
designs, opening interesting perspectives for future research on Reinforcement
Learning for closed-loop soft robot control.

<p>This paper revisits the standard pretrain-then-finetune paradigm used in
computer vision for visual recognition tasks. Typically, state-of-the-art
foundation models are pretrained using large scale (weakly) supervised datasets
with billions of images. We introduce an additional pre-pretraining stage that
is simple and uses the self-supervised MAE technique to initialize the model.
While MAE has only been shown to scale with the size of models, we find that it
scales with the size of the training dataset as well. Thus, our MAE-based
pre-pretraining scales with both model and data size making it applicable for
training foundation models. Pre-pretraining consistently improves both the
model convergence and the downstream transfer performance across a range of
model scales (millions to billions of parameters), and dataset sizes (millions
to billions of images). We measure the effectiveness of pre-pretraining on 10
different visual recognition tasks spanning image classification, video
recognition, object detection, low-shot classification and zero-shot
recognition. Our largest model achieves new state-of-the-art results on
iNaturalist-18 (91.7%), ImageNet-ReaL (91.1%), 1-shot ImageNet-1k (63.6%), and
zero-shot transfer on Food-101 (96.2%). Our study reveals that model
initialization plays a significant role, even for web-scale pretraining with

relations among individuals, such that better positioned members in a social
network benefit from faster access to diverse information and higher influence
on information dissemination. A variety of methods have been proposed in the
literature to measure social capital at an individual level. However, there is
a lack of methods to quantify social capital at a group level, which is
particularly important when the groups are defined on the grounds of protected
attributes. Furthermore, state-of-the-art approaches fail to model the role of
long-range interactions between nodes in the network and their contributions to
social capital. To fill this gap, we propose to measure the social capital of a
group of nodes by means of their information flow and emphasize the importance
of considering the whole network topology. Grounded in spectral graph theory,
we introduce three effective resistance-based measures of group social capital,
namely group isolation, group diameter and group control. We denote the social
capital disparity among different groups in a network as structural group
unfairness, and propose to mitigate it by means of a budgeted edge augmentation
heuristic that systematically increases the social capital of the most
disadvantaged group. In experiments on real networks, we uncover significant
levels of structural group unfairness when using gender as the protected
attribute, with females being the most disadvantaged group in comparison to
males. We also illustrate how our proposed edge augmentation approach is able
to not only effectively mitigate the structural group unfairness but also
increase the social capital of all groups in the network.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10818">Diffusion Language Models Generation Can Be Halted Early. (arXiv:2305.10818v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Diffusion Language models (DLMs) are a promising avenue for text generation
due to their practical properties on tractable controllable generation. They
also have the advantage of not having to predict text autoregressively.
However, despite these notable features, DLMs have not yet reached the
performance levels of their autoregressive counterparts. One of the ways to
reduce the performance gap between these two types of language models is to
speed up the generation of DLMs. Therefore, we propose a novel methodology to
address this issue in this work. It enables the execution of more generation
steps within a given time frame, leading to higher-quality outputs.
Specifically, our methods estimate DLMs completeness of text generation and
allow adaptive halting of the generation process. We evaluate our methods on
Plaid, SSD, and CDCD DLMs and create a cohesive perspective on their generation
workflows. Finally, we confirm that our methods allow halting these models and
decrease the generation time by $10$-$40$\% without a drop in the quality of
model samples.

<p>Label noise poses an important challenge in machine learning, especially in
deep learning, in which large models with high expressive power dominate the
field. Models of that kind are prone to memorizing incorrect labels, thereby
harming generalization performance. Many methods have been proposed to address
this problem, including robust loss functions and more complex label correction
approaches. Robust loss functions are appealing due to their simplicity, but
typically lack flexibility, while label correction usually adds substantial
complexity to the training setup. In this paper, we suggest to address the
shortcomings of both methodologies by "ambiguating" the target information,
adding additional, complementary candidate labels in case the learner is not
sufficiently convinced of the observed training label. More precisely, we
leverage the framework of so-called superset learning to construct set-valued
targets based on a confidence threshold, which deliver imprecise yet more
reliable beliefs about the ground-truth, effectively helping the learner to
suppress the memorization effect. In an extensive empirical evaluation, our
method demonstrates favorable learning behavior on synthetic and real-world
noise, confirming the effectiveness in detecting and correcting erroneous
training labels.

<p>We present Point2SSM, a novel unsupervised learning approach for constructing
correspondence-based statistical shape models (SSMs) directly from raw point
clouds. SSM is crucial in clinical research, enabling population-level analysis
of morphological variation in bones and organs. Traditional methods of SSM
construction have limitations, including the requirement of noise-free surface
meshes or binary volumes, reliance on assumptions or templates, and prolonged
inference times due to simultaneous optimization of the entire cohort.
Point2SSM overcomes these barriers by providing a data-driven solution that
infers SSMs directly from raw point clouds, reducing inference burdens and
increasing applicability as point clouds are more easily acquired. While deep
learning on 3D point clouds has seen success in unsupervised representation
learning and shape correspondence, its application to anatomical SSM
construction is largely unexplored. We conduct a benchmark of state-of-the-art
point cloud deep networks on the SSM task, revealing their limited robustness
to clinical challenges such as noisy, sparse, or incomplete input and limited
training data. Point2SSM addresses these issues through an attention-based
module, providing effective correspondence mappings from learned point
features. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms existing networks in terms of accurate surface sampling and
correspondence, better capturing population-level statistics.

<p>Exploration is essential in reinforcement learning, particularly in
environments where external rewards are sparse. Here we focus on exploration
with intrinsic rewards, where the agent transiently augments the external
rewards with self-generated intrinsic rewards. Although the study of intrinsic
rewards has a long history, existing methods focus on composing the intrinsic
reward based on measures of future prospects of states, ignoring the
information contained in the retrospective structure of transition sequences.
Here we argue that the agent can utilise retrospective information to generate
explorative behaviour with structure-awareness, facilitating efficient
exploration based on global instead of local information. We propose
Successor-Predecessor Intrinsic Exploration (SPIE), an exploration algorithm
based on a novel intrinsic reward combining prospective and retrospective
information. We show that SPIE yields more efficient and ethologically
plausible exploratory behaviour in environments with sparse rewards and
bottleneck states than competing methods. We also implement SPIE in deep
reinforcement learning agents, and show that the resulting agent achieves
stronger empirical performance than existing methods on sparse-reward Atari
games.

<p>"You never forget how to ride a bike", -- but how is that possible? The brain
is able to learn complex skills, stop the practice for years, learn other
skills in between, and still retrieve the original knowledge when necessary.
The mechanisms of this capability, referred to as lifelong learning (or
continual learning, CL), are unknown. We suggest a bio-plausible
meta-plasticity rule building on classical work in CL which we summarize in two
principles: (i) neurons are context selective, and (ii) a local availability
variable partially freezes the plasticity if the neuron was relevant for
previous tasks. In a new neuro-centric formalization of these principles, we
suggest that neuron selectivity and neuron-wide consolidation is a simple and
viable meta-plasticity hypothesis to enable CL in the brain. In simulation,
this simple model balances forgetting and consolidation leading to better
transfer learning than contemporary CL algorithms on image recognition and

<p>We address the problem of identifying the optimal policy with a fixed
confidence level in a multi-armed bandit setup, when \emph{the arms are subject
to linear constraints}. Unlike the standard best-arm identification problem
which is well studied, the optimal policy in this case may not be deterministic
and could mix between several arms. This changes the geometry of the problem
which we characterize via an information-theoretic lower bound. We introduce
two asymptotically optimal algorithms for this setting, one based on the
Track-and-Stop method and the other based on a game-theoretic approach. Both
these algorithms try to track an optimal allocation based on the lower bound
and computed by a weighted projection onto the boundary of a normal cone.
Finally, we provide empirical results that validate our bounds and visualize
how constraints change the hardness of the problem.

<p>We study the problem of sequential prediction in the stochastic setting with
an adversary that is allowed to inject clean-label adversarial (or
out-of-distribution) examples. Algorithms designed to handle purely stochastic
data tend to fail in the presence of such adversarial examples, often leading
to erroneous predictions. This is undesirable in many high-stakes applications
such as medical recommendations, where abstaining from predictions on
adversarial examples is preferable to misclassification. On the other hand,
assuming fully adversarial data leads to very pessimistic bounds that are often
vacuous in practice.
</p>
<p>To capture this motivation, we propose a new model of sequential prediction
that sits between the purely stochastic and fully adversarial settings by
allowing the learner to abstain from making a prediction at no cost on
adversarial examples. Assuming access to the marginal distribution on the
non-adversarial examples, we design a learner whose error scales with the VC
dimension (mirroring the stochastic setting) of the hypothesis class, as
opposed to the Littlestone dimension which characterizes the fully adversarial
setting. Furthermore, we design a learner for VC dimension~1 classes, which
works even in the absence of access to the marginal distribution. Our key
technical contribution is a novel measure for quantifying uncertainty for
learning VC classes, which may be of independent interest.

<p>With the widespread digitization of finance and the increasing popularity of
cryptocurrencies, the sophistication of fraud schemes devised by cybercriminals
is growing. Money laundering -- the movement of illicit funds to conceal their
origins -- can cross bank and national boundaries, producing complex
transaction patterns. The UN estimates 2-5\% of global GDP or \$0.8 - \$2.0
trillion dollars are laundered globally each year. Unfortunately, real data to
train machine learning models to detect laundering is generally not available,
and previous synthetic data generators have had significant shortcomings. A
realistic, standardized, publicly-available benchmark is needed for comparing
models and for the advancement of the area.
</p>
<p>To this end, this paper contributes a synthetic financial transaction dataset
generator and a set of synthetically generated AML (Anti-Money Laundering)
datasets. We have calibrated this agent-based generator to match real
transactions as closely as possible and made the datasets public. We describe
the generator in detail and demonstrate how the datasets generated can help
compare different machine learning models in terms of their AML abilities. In a
key way, using synthetic data in these comparisons can be even better than
using real data: the ground truth labels are complete, whilst many laundering
transactions in real data are never detected.

<p>Many self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) have been introduced over the last
few years, improving performance and data efficiency on various speech tasks.
However, these empirical successes alone do not give a complete picture of what
is learned during pre-training. Recent work has begun analyzing how S3Ms encode
certain properties, such as phonetic and speaker information, but we still lack
a proper understanding of knowledge encoded at the word level and beyond. In
this work, we use lightweight analysis methods to study segment-level
linguistic properties -- word identity, boundaries, pronunciation, syntactic
features, and semantic features -- encoded in S3Ms. We present a comparative
study of layer-wise representations from ten S3Ms and find that (i) the
frame-level representations within each word segment are not all equally
informative, and (ii) the pre-training objective and model size heavily
influence the accessibility and distribution of linguistic information across
layers. We also find that on several tasks -- word discrimination, word
segmentation, and semantic sentence similarity -- S3Ms trained with visual
grounding outperform their speech-only counterparts. Finally, our task-based
analyses demonstrate an improved performance on word segmentation and acoustic
word discrimination while using simpler methods than prior work.

<p>Hybrid variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising for solving
practical problems such as combinatorial optimization, quantum chemistry
simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum error correction on noisy
quantum computers. However, with typical random ansatz or quantum alternating
operator ansatz, derived variational quantum algorithms become a black box for
model interpretation. In this paper we construct a quantum regression algorithm
wherein the quantum state directly encodes the classical data table and the
variational parameters correspond directly to the regression coefficients which
are real numbers by construction, providing a high degree of model
interpretability and minimal cost to optimize with the right expressiveness.
Instead of assuming the state preparation is given by granted, we discuss the
state preparation with different encoders and their time complexity and overall
resource cost. We can take advantage of the encoded data structure to cut down
the algorithm time complexity. To the best of our knowledge, we show for the
first time explicitly how the linkage of the classical data structure can be
taken advantage of directly through quantum subroutines by construction. For
nonlinear regression, our algorithm can be extended by building nonlinear
features into the training data as demonstrated by numerical results. In
addition, we demonstrate that the model trainability is achievable only when
the number of features $M$ is much less than the number of records $L$ for the
encoded data structure to justify $L\gg M$ in our resource estimation.

<p>In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), condition monitoring sensor
signals from complex systems often exhibit nonlinear and stochastic
spatial-temporal dynamics under varying conditions. These complex dynamics make
fault detection particularly challenging. While previous methods effectively
model these dynamics, they often neglect the evolution of relationships between
sensor signals. Undetected shifts in these relationships can lead to
significant system failures. Furthermore, these methods frequently misidentify
novel operating conditions as faults. Addressing these limitations, we propose
DyEdgeGAT (Dynamic Edge via Graph Attention), a novel approach for early-stage
fault detection in IIoT systems. DyEdgeGAT's primary innovation lies in a novel
graph inference scheme for multivariate time series that tracks the evolution
of relationships between time series, enabled by dynamic edge construction.
Another key innovation of DyEdgeGAT is its ability to incorporate operating
condition contexts into node dynamics modeling, enhancing its accuracy and
robustness. We rigorously evaluated DyEdgeGAT using both a synthetic dataset,
simulating varying levels of fault severity, and a real-world industrial-scale
multiphase flow facility benchmark with diverse fault types under varying
operating conditions and detection complexities. The results show that
DyEdgeGAT significantly outperforms other baseline methods in fault detection,
particularly in the early stages with low severity, and exhibits robust
performance under novel operating conditions.

<p>The extraction of modular object-centric representations for downstream tasks
is an emerging area of research. Learning grounded representations of objects
that are guaranteed to be stable and invariant promises robust performance
across different tasks and environments. Slot Attention (SA) learns
object-centric representations by assigning objects to \textit{slots}, but
presupposes a \textit{single} distribution from which all slots are randomly
initialised. This results in an inability to learn \textit{specialized} slots
which bind to specific object types and remain invariant to identity-preserving
changes in object appearance. To address this, we present
\emph{\textsc{Co}nditional \textsc{S}lot \textsc{A}ttention} (\textsc{CoSA})

tooth meshes and point clouds. Additionally, we present a novel approach:
Variational FoldingNet (VF-Net), a fully probabilistic variational autoencoder

Instead, they rely on optimizing Chamfer distances, a metric that lacks a

distances with a suitable encoder, increasing computational efficiency while
simplifying the probabilistic extension. This allows for straightforward
application in various tasks, including mesh generation, shape completion, and

<p>Different conflicting optimization criteria arise naturally in various Deep
Learning scenarios. These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the
setting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss
minimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the
criteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we
present a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted
Chebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect
to several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can
identify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its
complexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems
are then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of
popular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,
while efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the
(economical and also ecological) sustainability issue of DNN models, with a
particular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with a
very large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks. Through
experiments conducted on two Machine Learning datasets, we demonstrate the
possibility of adaptively sparsifying the model during training without
significantly impacting its performance, if we are willing to apply

<p>Federated Learning (FL) allows several clients to construct a common global
machine-learning model without having to share their data. FL, however, faces
the challenge of statistical heterogeneity between the client's data, which
degrades performance and slows down the convergence toward the global model. In
this paper, we provide theoretical proof that minimizing heterogeneity between
clients facilitates the convergence of a global model for every single client.
This becomes particularly important under empirical concept shifts among
clients, rather than merely considering imbalanced classes, which have been
studied until now. Therefore, we propose a method for knowledge transfer
between clients where the server trains client-specific generators. Each
generator generates samples for the corresponding client to remove the conflict
with other clients' models. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real data,
along with a theoretical study, support the effectiveness of our method in
constructing a well-generalizable global model by reducing the conflict between
local models.

<p>Machine learning has been adapted to help solve NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems. One prevalent way is learning to construct solutions by
deep neural networks, which has been receiving more and more attention due to
the high efficiency and less requirement for expert knowledge. However, many
neural construction methods for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) focus on
synthetic problem instances with specified node distributions and limited
scales, leading to poor performance on real-world problems which usually
involve complex and unknown node distributions together with large scales. To
make neural VRP solvers more practical, we design an auxiliary policy that
learns from the local transferable topological features, named local policy,
and integrate it with a typical construction policy (which learns from the
global information of VRP instances) to form an ensemble policy. With joint
training, the aggregated policies perform cooperatively and complementarily to
boost generalization. The experimental results on two well-known benchmarks,
TSPLIB and CVRPLIB, of travelling salesman problem and capacitated VRP show
that the ensemble policy significantly improves both cross-distribution and
cross-scale generalization performance, and even performs well on real-world
problems with several thousand nodes.

<p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an extension of traditional Knowledge Graph
(KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial
task that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key
challenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical
subgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on
entity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge
representation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive
number of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it
challenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of
entities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a
significant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural
Network (TiPNN), which models historical information in an entity-independent
perspective. Specifically, TiPNN adopts a unified graph, namely history
temporal graph, to comprehensively capture and encapsulate information from
history. Subsequently, we utilize the defined query-aware temporal paths on a
history temporal graph to model historical path information related to queries
for reasoning. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed model not
only attains significant performance enhancements but also handles inductive
settings, while additionally facilitating the provision of reasoning evidence
through history temporal graphs.

<p>Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, while rich in information, often suffers
from sparsity, posing significant challenges in predictive modeling.
Traditional imputation methods inadequately distinguish between real and
imputed data, leading to potential inaccuracies in models. Addressing this, we
introduce PRISM, a novel approach that indirectly imputes data through
prototype representations of similar patients, thus ensuring denser and more
accurate embeddings. PRISM innovates further with a feature confidence learner
module, which evaluates the reliability of each feature in light of missing
data. Additionally, it incorporates a novel patient similarity metric that
accounts for feature confidence, avoiding overreliance on imprecise imputed
values. Our extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets
demonstrate PRISM's superior performance in predicting in-hospital mortality
and 30-day readmission tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in handling EHR data
sparsity. For the sake of reproducibility and further research, we have made
the code publicly available at https://github.com/yhzhu99/PRISM.

<p>We consider the problem of learning linear operators under squared loss
between two infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces in the online setting. We show
that the class of linear operators with uniformly bounded $p$-Schatten norm is
online learnable for any $p \in [1, \infty)$. On the other hand, we prove an
impossibility result by showing that the class of uniformly bounded linear
operators with respect to the operator norm is \textit{not} online learnable.
Moreover, we show a separation between sequential uniform convergence and
online learnability by identifying a class of bounded linear operators that is
online learnable but uniform convergence does not hold. Finally, we prove that
the impossibility result and the separation between uniform convergence and

<p>Label-free cell classification is advantageous for supplying pristine cells
for further use or examination, yet existing techniques frequently fall short
in terms of specificity and speed. In this study, we address these limitations
through the development of a novel machine learning framework, Multiplex Image
Machine Learning (MIML). This architecture uniquely combines label-free cell
images with biomechanical property data, harnessing the vast, often
underutilized morphological information intrinsic to each cell. By integrating
both types of data, our model offers a more holistic understanding of the
cellular properties, utilizing morphological information typically discarded in
traditional machine learning models. This approach has led to a remarkable
98.3\% accuracy in cell classification, a substantial improvement over models
that only consider a single data type. MIML has been proven effective in
classifying white blood cells and tumor cells, with potential for broader
application due to its inherent flexibility and transfer learning capability.
It's particularly effective for cells with similar morphology but distinct
biomechanical properties. This innovative approach has significant implications
across various fields, from advancing disease diagnostics to understanding
cellular behavior.

<p>Essential for an unfettered data market is the ability to discreetly select
and evaluate training data before finalizing a transaction between the data
owner and model owner. To safeguard the privacy of both data and model, this
process involves scrutinizing the target model through Multi-Party Computation
(MPC). While prior research has posited that the MPC-based evaluation of
Transformer models is excessively resource-intensive, this paper introduces an
innovative approach that renders data selection practical. The contributions of
this study encompass three pivotal elements: (1) a groundbreaking pipeline for
confidential data selection using MPC, (2) replicating intricate
high-dimensional operations with simplified low-dimensional MLPs trained on a
limited subset of pertinent data, and (3) implementing MPC in a concurrent,
multi-phase manner. The proposed method is assessed across an array of
Transformer models and NLP/CV benchmarks. In comparison to the direct MPC-based
evaluation of the target model, our approach substantially reduces the time

<p>Facial Action Unit (AU) detection often relies on highly-cost accurate
labeling or inaccurate pseudo labeling techniques in recent years. How to
introduce large amounts of unlabeled facial images in the wild into supervised
AU detection frameworks has become a challenging problem. Additionally, nearly
every type of AUs has the problem of unbalanced positive and negative samples.
Inspired by other multi-task learning frameworks, we first propose a multi-task
learning strategy boosting AU detection in the wild through jointing facial
landmark detection and AU domain separation and reconstruction. Our introduced
dual domains facial landmark detection framework can solve the lack of accurate
facial landmark coordinates during the AU domain separation and reconstruction
training process, while the parameters of homostructural facial extraction
modules from these two similar facial tasks are shared. Moreover, we propose a
pixel-level feature alignment scheme to maintain the consistency of features
obtained from two separation and reconstruction processes. Furthermore, a
weighted asymmetric loss is proposed to change the contribution of positive and
negative samples of each type of AUs to model parameters updating. Experimental
results on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate our superiority to most
state-of-the-art methods for AU detection.

<p>Due to the limited information about emerging diseases, symptoms are hard to
be noticed and recognized, so that the window for clinical intervention could
be ignored. An effective prognostic model is expected to assist doctors in
making right diagnosis and designing personalized treatment plan, so to
promptly prevent unfavorable outcomes. However, in the early stage of a
disease, limited data collection and clinical experiences, plus the concern out
of privacy and ethics, may result in restricted data availability for
reference, to the extent that even data labels are difficult to mark correctly.
In addition, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data of different diseases or of
different sources of the same disease can prove to be having serious
cross-dataset feature misalignment problems, greatly mutilating the efficiency
of deep learning models. This article introduces a domain-invariant
representation learning method to build a transition model from source dataset
to target dataset. By way of constraining the distribution shift of features
generated in disparate domains, domain-invariant features that are exclusively
relative to downstream tasks are captured, so to cultivate a unified

representation. Experimental results of several target tasks demonstrate that
our proposed model outperforms competing baseline methods and has higher rate

<p>Realistic physics engines play a crucial role for learning to manipulate
deformable objects such as garments in simulation. By doing so, researchers can
circumvent challenges such as sensing the deformation of the object in the
realworld. In spite of the extensive use of simulations for this task, few

real-world data. We present a benchmark dataset to evaluate the sim-to-real gap
in cloth manipulation. The dataset is collected by performing a dynamic as well
as a quasi-static cloth manipulation task involving contact with a rigid table.
We use the dataset to evaluate the reality gap, computational time, and

<p>In modern neuroscience, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been
a crucial and irreplaceable tool that provides a non-invasive window into the
dynamics of whole-brain activity. Nevertheless, fMRI is limited by hemodynamic
blurring as well as high cost, immobility, and incompatibility with metal
implants. Electroencephalography (EEG) is complementary to fMRI and can
directly record the cortical electrical activity at high temporal resolution,
but has more limited spatial resolution and is unable to recover information
about deep subcortical brain structures. The ability to obtain fMRI information
from EEG would enable cost-effective, imaging across a wider set of brain
regions. Further, beyond augmenting the capabilities of EEG, cross-modality
models would facilitate the interpretation of fMRI signals. However, as both
EEG and fMRI are high-dimensional and prone to artifacts, it is currently
challenging to model fMRI from EEG. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel architecture that can predict fMRI signals directly from multi-channel
EEG without explicit feature engineering. Our model achieves this by
implementing a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to learn frequency
information in brain dynamics from EEG, which serves as the input to a
subsequent encoder-decoder to effectively reconstruct the fMRI signal from a
specific brain region. We evaluate our model using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI
dataset with 8 subjects and investigate its potential for predicting
subcortical fMRI signals. The present results reveal that our model outperforms
a recent state-of-the-art model, and indicates the potential of leveraging
periodic activation functions in deep neural networks to model functional
neuroimaging data.

<p>While large language models (LLMs) have enabled learning knowledge from the
pre-training corpora, the acquired knowledge may be fundamentally incorrect or
outdated over time, which necessitates rectifying the knowledge of the language
model (LM) after the training. A promising approach involves employing a
hyper-network to generate parameter shift, whereas existing hyper-networks
suffer from inferior scalability in synchronous editing operation amount. To
mitigate the problem, we propose the MAssive Language Model Editing Network
(MALMEN), which formulates the parameter shift aggregation as the least square
problem, subsequently updating the LM parameters using the normal equation. To
accommodate editing multiple facts simultaneously with limited memory budgets,
we separate the computation on the hyper-network and LM, enabling arbitrary
batch size on both neural networks. Our method is evaluated by editing up to
thousands of facts on LMs with different architectures, i.e., BERT-base, GPT-2,
T5-XL (2.8B), and GPT-J (6B), across various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
i.e., closed book fact-checking and question answering. Remarkably, MALMEN is
capable of editing hundreds of times more facts than strong baselines with the
identical hyper-network architecture and outperforms editor specifically

<p>Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a promising modulation scheme for
wireless communication in high-mobility scenarios. Recently, a reservoir
computing (RC) based approach has been introduced for online subframe-based
symbol detection in the OTFS system, where only a limited number of
over-the-air (OTA) pilot symbols are utilized for training. However, this
approach does not leverage the domain knowledge specific to the OTFS system to
fully unlock the potential of RC. This paper introduces a novel two-dimensional
RC (2D-RC) method that incorporates the domain knowledge of the OTFS system
into the design for symbol detection in an online subframe-based manner.
Specifically, as the channel interaction in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain is a
two-dimensional (2D) circular operation, the 2D-RC is designed to have the 2D
circular padding procedure and the 2D filtering structure to embed this
knowledge. With the introduced architecture, 2D-RC can operate in the DD domain
with only a single neural network, instead of necessitating multiple RCs to
track channel variations in the time domain as in previous work. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the advantages of the 2D-RC approach over the previous
RC-based approach and compared model-based methods across different OTFS system
variants and modulation orders.

not effective in dynamic environments with unanticipated changes, while
long-term learning lacks scalability, resilience, and flexibility. To bridge
this gap, this paper introduces a new progressive approach that combines
short-term plan generation and selection based on distributed optimization with
a DRL-based long-term strategic scheduling of flying direction. Extensive
experimentation with datasets generated from realistic urban mobility
underscores an outstanding performance of the proposed solution compared to
state-of-the-art. We also provide compelling new insights about the role of
drones density in different sensing missions, the energy safety of drone
operations and how to prioritize investments for key locations of charging
infrastructure.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00024">Can LLMs Patch Security Issues?. (arXiv:2312.00024v2 [cs.CR] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency in code
generation. Nonetheless, similar to human developers, these models might
generate code that contains security vulnerabilities and flaws. Writing secure
code remains a substantial challenge, as vulnerabilities often arise during
interactions between programs and external systems or services, such as
databases and operating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach,
Feedback-Driven Solution Synthesis (FDSS), designed to explore the use of LLMs
in receiving feedback from Bandit, which is a static code analysis tool, and
then the LLMs generate potential solutions to resolve security vulnerabilities.
Each solution, along with the vulnerable code, is then sent back to the LLM for
code refinement. Our approach shows a significant improvement over the baseline
and outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset,
PythonSecurityEval, collected from real-world scenarios on Stack Overflow to
evaluate the LLMs' ability to generate secure code. Code and data are available

<p>Kernel methods are a popular class of nonlinear predictive models in machine
learning. Scalable algorithms for learning kernel models need to be iterative
in nature, but convergence can be slow due to poor conditioning. Spectral
preconditioning is an important tool to speed-up the convergence of such
iterative algorithms for training kernel models. However computing and storing
a spectral preconditioner can be expensive which can lead to large
computational and storage overheads, precluding the application of kernel
methods to problems with large datasets. A Nystrom approximation of the
spectral preconditioner is often cheaper to compute and store, and has
demonstrated success in practical applications. In this paper we analyze the
trade-offs of using such an approximated preconditioner. Specifically, we show
that a sample of logarithmic size (as a function of the size of the dataset)
enables the Nystrom-based approximated preconditioner to accelerate gradient
descent nearly as well as the exact preconditioner, while also reducing the
computational and storage overheads.

<p>Semantic segmentation enables robots to perceive and reason about their
environments beyond geometry. Most of such systems build upon deep learning
approaches. As autonomous robots are commonly deployed in initially unknown
environments, pre-training on static datasets cannot always capture the variety
of domains and limits the robot's perception performance during missions.
Recently, self-supervised and fully supervised active learning methods emerged
to improve a robot's vision. These approaches rely on large in-domain
pre-training datasets or require substantial human labelling effort. We propose
a planning method for semi-supervised active learning of semantic segmentation
that substantially reduces human labelling requirements compared to fully
supervised approaches. We leverage an adaptive map-based planner guided towards
the frontiers of unexplored space with high model uncertainty collecting
training data for human labelling. A key aspect of our approach is to combine
the sparse high-quality human labels with pseudo labels automatically extracted
from highly certain environment map areas. Experimental results show that our
method reaches segmentation performance close to fully supervised approaches
with drastically reduced human labelling effort while outperforming
self-supervised approaches.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate a vast amount of factual information
within their pre-trained weights, as evidenced by their ability to answer
diverse questions across different domains. However, this knowledge is
inherently limited, relying heavily on the characteristics of the training
data. Consequently, using external datasets to incorporate new information or
refine the capabilities of LLMs on previously seen information poses a
significant challenge. In this study, we compare two common approaches:
unsupervised fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate
both approaches on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks across different
topics. Our findings reveal that while unsupervised fine-tuning offers some
improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, both for existing knowledge
encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Moreover, we find that
LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised
fine-tuning, and that exposing them to numerous variations of the same fact
during training could alleviate this problem.

<p>Prompt-tuning has emerged as a highly effective approach for adapting a
pre-trained language model (PLM) to handle new natural language processing
tasks with limited input samples. However, the success of prompt-tuning has led
to adversaries attempting backdoor attacks against this technique. Previous
prompt-based backdoor attacks faced challenges when implemented through
few-shot prompt-tuning, requiring either full-model fine-tuning or a large
training dataset. We observe the difficulty in constructing a prompt-based
backdoor using few-shot prompt-tuning, which involves freezing the PLM and
tuning a soft prompt with a restricted set of input samples. This approach
introduces an imbalanced poisoned dataset, making it susceptible to overfitting
and lacking attention awareness. To address these challenges, we introduce
TrojFST for backdoor attacks within the framework of few-shot prompt-tuning.
TrojFST comprises three modules: balanced poison learning, selective token
poisoning, and trojan-trigger attention. In comparison to previous prompt-based
backdoor attacks, TrojFST demonstrates significant improvements, enhancing ASR
$&gt; 9\%$ and CDA by $&gt; 4\%$ across various PLMs and a diverse set of downstream
tasks.

<p>Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a
significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the
complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training
methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the
Flattening strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models
involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and
applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the
different workloads inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy
exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the
overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive
model placement framework that offers two flexible model placement strategies.
The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication
costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive
devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Separation strategy
improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and
inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models.
Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and allows for the
agile allocation of models across devices in a fine-grained manner for various
training scenarios, involving models of varying sizes and devices of different
scales. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our Interleaving and
Separation strategies can achieve notable improvements up to 11X, compared to
the current SOTA approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and
adaptability of our approaches in accelerating the training of distributed
RLHF.

<p>In this study, we explore an innovative approach for neural network

objective is to maintain high accuracy levels in pruned models, a critical

sampling in facilitating robust learning and enabling networks to retain
crucial information even after substantial reduction in their complexity. We
validate our approach across various datasets and neural architectures,
demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. The paper also delves
into the theoretical aspects, explaining how gradient sampling techniques
contribute to the robustness of models during pruning. Our results suggest a

<p>Deep learning for Hamiltonian regression of quantum systems in material
research necessitates satisfying the covariance laws, among which achieving
SO(3)-equivariance without sacrificing the expressiveness capability of
networks remains an elusive challenge due to the restriction to non-linear
mappings on guaranteeing theoretical equivariance. To alleviate the
covariance-expressiveness dilemma, we propose a hybrid framework with two
cascaded regression stages. The first stage, i.e., a theoretically-guaranteed
covariant neural network modeling symmetry properties of 3D atom systems,
predicts baseline Hamiltonians with theoretically covariant features extracted,
assisting the second stage in learning covariance. Meanwhile, the second stage,
powered by a non-linear 3D graph Transformer network we propose for structural
modeling of atomic systems, refines the first stage's output as a fine-grained
prediction of Hamiltonians with better expressiveness capability. The
combination of a theoretically covariant yet inevitably less expressive model
with a highly expressive non-linear network enables precise, generalizable
predictions while maintaining robust covariance under coordinate
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
Hamiltonian prediction for electronic structure calculations, confirmed through
experiments on six crystalline material databases. The codes and configuration
scripts are available in the supplementary material.

<p>Split Learning (SL) is a promising Distributed Learning approach in
electromyography (EMG) based prosthetic control, due to its applicability
within resource-constrained environments. Other learning approaches, such as
Deep Learning and Federated Learning (FL), provide suboptimal solutions, since
prosthetic devices are extremely limited in terms of processing power and
battery life. The viability of implementing SL in such scenarios is caused by
its inherent model partitioning, with clients executing the smaller model
segment. However, selecting an inadequate cut layer hinders the training
process in SL systems. This paper presents an algorithm for optimal cut layer
selection in terms of maximizing the convergence rate of the model. The
performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm substantially
accelerates the convergence in an EMG pattern recognition task for improving
prosthetic device control.

<p>A common explanation for negative user impacts of content recommender systems
is misalignment between the platform's objective and user welfare. In this
work, we show that misalignment in the platform's objective is not the only
potential cause of unintended impacts on users: even when the platform's
objective is fully aligned with user welfare, the platform's learning algorithm
can induce negative downstream impacts on users. The source of these user
impacts is that different pieces of content may generate observable user
reactions (feedback information) at different rates; these feedback rates may
correlate with content properties, such as controversiality or demographic
similarity of the creator, that affect the user experience. Since differences
in feedback rates can impact how often the learning algorithm engages with
different content, the learning algorithm may inadvertently promote content
with certain such properties. Using the multi-armed bandit framework with
probabilistic feedback, we examine the relationship between feedback rates and
a learning algorithm's engagement with individual arms for different no-regret
algorithms. We prove that no-regret algorithms can exhibit a wide range of
dependencies: if the feedback rate of an arm increases, some no-regret
algorithms engage with the arm more, some no-regret algorithms engage with the
arm less, and other no-regret algorithms engage with the arm approximately the
same number of times. From a platform design perspective, our results highlight
the importance of looking beyond regret when measuring an algorithm's
performance, and assessing the nature of a learning algorithm's engagement with
different types of content as well as their resulting downstream impacts.

issue. This paper studies the integration of a contrastive learning objective
for fine-tuning LLMs for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text

systems. Ideally, explanations should be expressed using human-interpretable
semantic concepts. Moreover, the causal relations between these concepts should
be captured by the explainer to allow for reasoning about the explanations.
Lastly, explanation methods should be efficient and not compromise the
performance of the predictive task. Despite the rapid advances in AI
explainability in recent years, as far as we know to date, no method fulfills
these three properties. Indeed, mainstream methods for local concept
explainability do not produce causal explanations and incur a trade-off between
explainability and prediction performance. We present DiConStruct, an
explanation method that is both concept-based and causal, with the goal of
creating more interpretable local explanations in the form of structural causal
models and concept attributions. Our explainer works as a distillation model to
any black-box machine learning model by approximating its predictions while
producing the respective explanations. Because of this, DiConStruct generates
explanations efficiently while not impacting the black-box prediction task. We
validate our method on an image dataset and a tabular dataset, showing that
DiConStruct approximates the black-box models with higher fidelity than other
concept explainability baselines, while providing explanations that include the
causal relations between the concepts.

<p>Speech-driven 3D facial animation is challenging due to the scarcity of
large-scale visual-audio datasets despite extensive research. Most prior works,
typically focused on learning regression models on a small dataset using the
method of least squares, encounter difficulties generating diverse lip
movements from speech and require substantial effort in refining the generated
outputs. To address these issues, we propose a speech-driven 3D facial
animation with a diffusion model (SAiD), a lightweight Transformer-based U-Net
with a cross-modality alignment bias between audio and visual to enhance lip
synchronization. Moreover, we introduce BlendVOCA, a benchmark dataset of pairs
of speech audio and parameters of a blendshape facial model, to address the
scarcity of public resources. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves comparable or superior performance in lip
synchronization to baselines, ensures more diverse lip movements, and
streamlines the animation editing process.

<p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a task that continually adapts a pre-trained
source model to the target domain during inference. One popular approach
involves fine-tuning model with cross-entropy loss according to estimated
pseudo-labels. However, its performance is significantly affected by noisy
pseudo-labels. This study reveals that minimizing the classification error of
each sample causes the cross-entropy loss's vulnerability to label noise. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Decoupled Prototype Learning (DPL)
method that features prototype-centric loss computation. First, we decouple the
optimization of class prototypes. For each class prototype, we reduce its
distance with positive samples and enlarge its distance with negative samples
in a contrastive manner. This strategy prevents the model from overfitting to
noisy pseudo-labels. Second, we propose a memory-based strategy to enhance
DPL's robustness for the small batch sizes often encountered in TTA. We update
each class's pseudo-feature from a memory in a momentum manner and insert an
additional DPL loss. Finally, we introduce a consistency regularization-based
approach to leverage samples with unconfident pseudo-labels. This approach
transfers feature styles of samples with unconfident pseudo-labels to those
with confident pseudo-labels. Thus, more reliable samples for TTA are created.
The experimental results demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance on domain generalization benchmarks, and reliably improve the
performance of self-training-based methods on image corruption benchmarks. The
code will be released.

<p>Serverless computing relieves developers from the burden of resource
management, thus providing ease-of-use to the users and the opportunity to
optimize resource utilization for the providers. However, today's serverless
systems lack performance guarantees for function invocations, thus limiting
support for performance-critical applications: we observed severe performance
variability (up to 6x). Providers lack visibility into user functions and hence
find it challenging to right-size them: we observed heavy resource
underutilization (up to 80%). To understand the causes behind the performance
variability and underutilization, we conducted a measurement study of commonly
deployed serverless functions and learned that the function performance and
resource utilization depend crucially on function semantics and inputs. Our key
insight is to delay making resource allocation decisions until after the
function inputs are available. We introduce Shabari, a resource management
framework for serverless systems that makes decisions as late as possible to
right-size each invocation to meet functions' performance objectives (SLOs) and
improve resource utilization. Shabari uses an online learning agent to
right-size each function invocation based on the features of the function input
and makes cold-start-aware scheduling decisions. For a range of serverless
functions and inputs, Shabari reduces SLO violations by 11-73% while not
wasting any vCPUs and reducing wasted memory by 64-94% in the median case,
compared to state-of-the-art systems, including Aquatope, Parrotfish, and
Cypress.

<p>The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning
(ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training
data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading
them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input
data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data
volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data
systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in
hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources -- or
worse -- underutilize expensive accelerators.
</p>
<p>To address these demands, we present cedar, a programming model and framework
that allows users to easily build, optimize, and execute input data pipelines.
cedar presents an easy-to-use programming interface, allowing users to define
input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML
frameworks and libraries. Meanwhile, cedar transparently applies a complex and
extensible set of optimization techniques (e.g., offloading, caching,
prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It then orchestrates processing across a
customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to
maximize processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. On
average across six diverse input data pipelines, cedar achieves a 2.49x, 1.87x,
2.18x, and 2.74x higher performance compared to tf.data, tf.data service, Ray
Data, and PyTorch's DataLoader, respectively.

<p>Intervertebral disc disease, a prevalent ailment, frequently leads to
intermittent or persistent low back pain, and diagnosing and assessing of this
disease rely on accurate measurement of vertebral bone and intervertebral disc
geometries from lumbar MR images. Deep neural network (DNN) models may assist
clinicians with more efficient image segmentation of individual instances
(disks and vertebrae) of the lumbar spine in an automated way, which is termed
as instance image segmentation. In this work, we proposed SymTC, an innovative
lumbar spine MR image segmentation model that combines the strengths of
Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, we designed a
parallel dual-path architecture to merge CNN layers and Transformer layers, and
we integrated a novel position embedding into the self-attention module of
Transformer, enhancing the utilization of positional information for more
accurate segmentation. To further improves model performance, we introduced a
new data augmentation technique to create synthetic yet realistic MR image
dataset, named SSMSpine, which is made publicly available. We evaluated our
SymTC and the other 15 existing image segmentation models on our private
in-house dataset and the public SSMSpine dataset, using two metrics, Dice
Similarity Coefficient and 95% Hausdorff Distance. The results show that our
SymTC has the best performance for segmenting vertebral bones and
intervertebral discs in lumbar spine MR images. The SymTC code and SSMSpine

<p>Exploration remains a critical issue in deep reinforcement learning for an
agent to attain high returns in unknown environments. Although the prevailing
exploration Random Network Distillation (RND) algorithm has been demonstrated
to be effective in numerous environments, it often needs more discriminative
power in bonus allocation. This paper highlights the ``bonus inconsistency''
issue within RND, pinpointing its primary limitation. To address this issue, we
introduce the Distributional RND (DRND), a derivative of the RND. DRND enhances
the exploration process by distilling a distribution of random networks and
implicitly incorporating pseudo counts to improve the precision of bonus
allocation. This refinement encourages agents to engage in more extensive
exploration. Our method effectively mitigates the inconsistency issue without
introducing significant computational overhead. Both theoretical analysis and
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the
original RND algorithm. Our method excels in challenging online exploration
scenarios and effectively serves as an anti-exploration mechanism in D4RL
offline tasks.

<p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in
handling a variety of visual-language tasks. However, current MLLM benchmarks
are predominantly designed to evaluate reasoning based on static information
about a single image, and the ability of modern MLLMs to extrapolate from image
sequences, which is essential for understanding our ever-changing world, has
been less investigated. To address this challenge, this paper introduces
Mementos, a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs' sequential image reasoning
abilities. Mementos features 4,761 diverse image sequences with varying
lengths. We also employ a GPT-4 assisted method to evaluate MLLM reasoning
performance. Through a careful evaluation of nine recent MLLMs on Mementos,
including GPT-4V and Gemini, we find that they struggle to accurately describe
dynamic information about given image sequences, often leading to
hallucinations/misrepresentations of objects and their corresponding behaviors.
Our quantitative analysis and case studies identify three key factors impacting
MLLMs' sequential image reasoning: the correlation between object and
behavioral hallucinations, the influence of cooccurring behaviors, and the
compounding impact of behavioral hallucinations. Our dataset is available at

<p>Recent work has shown that methods like SAM which either explicitly or
implicitly penalize second order information can improve generalization in deep
learning. Seemingly similar methods like weight noise and gradient penalties
often fail to provide such benefits. We show that these differences can be
explained by the structure of the Hessian of the loss. First, we show that a
common decomposition of the Hessian can be quantitatively interpreted as
separating the feature exploitation from feature exploration. The feature
exploration, which can be described by the Nonlinear Modeling Error matrix
(NME), is commonly neglected in the literature since it vanishes at
interpolation. Our work shows that the NME is in fact important as it can
explain why gradient penalties are sensitive to the choice of activation
function. Using this insight we design interventions to improve performance. We
also provide evidence that challenges the long held equivalence of weight noise
and gradient penalties. This equivalence relies on the assumption that the NME
can be ignored, which we find does not hold for modern networks since they
involve significant feature learning. We find that regularizing feature
exploitation but not feature exploration yields performance similar to gradient
penalties.

<p>This paper explores the integration of optimal transport (OT) theory with
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). This integration uses OT to handle
distributions and transportation problems to enhance the efficiency,
coordination, and adaptability of MARL. There are five key areas where OT can
impact MARL: (1) policy alignment, where OT's Wasserstein metric is used to
align divergent agent strategies towards unified goals; (2) distributed
resource management, employing OT to optimize resource allocation among agents;
(3) addressing non-stationarity, using OT to adapt to dynamic environmental
shifts; (4) scalable multi-agent learning, harnessing OT for decomposing
large-scale learning objectives into manageable tasks; and (5) enhancing energy
efficiency, applying OT principles to develop sustainable MARL systems. This

<p>Federated learning is a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm
that has gained strong momentum in recent years. In federated learning, a
central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the
models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data.
Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to
encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is
largely due to data heterogeneity. The slow convergence becomes particularly
problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be
strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting
methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side
such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be
impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel federated aggregation strategy,
TurboSVM-FL, that poses no additional computation burden on the client side and
can significantly accelerate convergence for federated classification task,
especially when clients are "lazy" and train their models solely for few epochs
for next global aggregation. TurboSVM-FL extensively utilizes support vector
machine to conduct selective aggregation and max-margin spread-out
regularization on class embeddings. We evaluate TurboSVM-FL on multiple
datasets including FEMNIST, CelebA, and Shakespeare using user-independent
validation with non-iid data distribution. Our results show that TurboSVM-FL
can significantly outperform existing popular algorithms on convergence rate
and reduce communication rounds while delivering better test metrics including
accuracy, F1 score, and MCC.

<p>Recent empirical and theoretical studies have established the generalization
capabilities of large machine learning models that are trained to
(approximately or exactly) fit noisy data. In this work, we prove a surprising
result that even if the ground truth itself is robust to adversarial examples,
and the benignly overfitted model is benign in terms of the ``standard''
out-of-sample risk objective, this benign overfitting process can be harmful
when out-of-sample data are subject to adversarial manipulation. More
specifically, our main results contain two parts: (i) the min-norm estimator in
overparameterized linear model always leads to adversarial vulnerability in the
``benign overfitting'' setting; (ii) we verify an asymptotic trade-off result
between the standard risk and the ``adversarial'' risk of every ridge
regression estimator, implying that under suitable conditions these two items
cannot both be small at the same time by any single choice of the ridge
regularization parameter. Furthermore, under the lazy training regime, we
demonstrate parallel results on two-layer neural tangent kernel (NTK) model,
which align with empirical observations in deep neural networks. Our finding
provides theoretical insights into the puzzling phenomenon observed in
practice, where the true target function (e.g., human) is robust against
adverasrial attack, while beginly overfitted neural networks lead to models
that are not robust.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) commonly employ autoregressive generation during
inference, leading to high memory bandwidth demand and consequently extended
latency. To mitigate this inefficiency, we present Bi-directional Tuning for
lossless Acceleration (BiTA), an innovative method expediting LLMs via
streamlined semi-autoregressive generation and draft verification. Inspired by
the concept of prompt tuning, we enhance LLMs with a parameter-efficient design
called bi-directional tuning for the capability in semi-autoregressive
generation. Employing efficient tree-based decoding, the models perform draft
candidate generation and verification in parallel, ensuring outputs identical
to their autoregressive counterparts under greedy sampling. BiTA serves as a
lightweight plug-in module, seamlessly boosting the inference efficiency of
existing LLMs without requiring additional assistance models or incurring
significant extra memory costs. Applying the proposed BiTA, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat
achieves a 2.7$\times$ speedup on the MT-Bench benchmark. Extensive experiments

world applications. The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) shows an
alternative to this traditional workflow, by forming a proximal prediction
pipeline of the testing performance without the presence of ground-truth
labels. Despite its recent successes, the AutoEval frameworks still suffer from
an overconfidence issue, substantial storage and computational cost. In that
regard, we propose a novel measure -- Meta-Distribution Energy (MDE) -- that
allows the AutoEval framework to be both more efficient and effective. The core
of the MDE is to establish a meta-distribution statistic, on the information
(energy) associated with individual samples, then offer a smoother
representation enabled by energy-based learning. We further provide our
theoretical insights by connecting the MDE with the classification loss. We
provide extensive experiments across modalities, datasets and different
architectural backbones to validate MDE's validity, together with its
superiority compared with prior approaches. We also prove MDE's versatility by
showing its seamless integration with large-scale models, and easy adaption to
learning scenarios with noisy- or imbalanced- labels. Code and data are

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12806">Binary structured physics-informed neural networks for solving equations with rapidly changing solutions. (arXiv:2401.12806v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Liu_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yanzhi Liu</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wu_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ruifan Wu</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Jiang_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ying Jiang</a></p>
<p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), rooted in deep learning, have
emerged as a promising approach for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs). By embedding the physical information described by PDEs into
feedforward neural networks, PINNs are trained as surrogate models to
approximate solutions without the need for label data. Nevertheless, even
though PINNs have shown remarkable performance, they can face difficulties,
especially when dealing with equations featuring rapidly changing solutions.
These difficulties encompass slow convergence, susceptibility to becoming
trapped in local minima, and reduced solution accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose a binary structured physics-informed neural network (BsPINN)
framework, which employs binary structured neural network (BsNN) as the neural
network component. By leveraging a binary structure that reduces inter-neuron
connections compared to fully connected neural networks, BsPINNs excel in
capturing the local features of solutions more effectively and efficiently.
These features are particularly crucial for learning the rapidly changing in
the nature of solutions. In a series of numerical experiments solving Burgers
equation, Euler equation, Helmholtz equation, and high-dimension Poisson
equation, BsPINNs exhibit superior convergence speed and heightened accuracy
compared to PINNs. From these experiments, we discover that BsPINNs resolve the
issues caused by increased hidden layers in PINNs resulting in over-smoothing,
and prevent the decline in accuracy due to non-smoothness of PDEs solutions.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13360">Debiased Sample Selection for Combating Noisy Labels. (arXiv:2401.13360v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Learning with noisy labels aims to ensure model generalization given a
label-corrupted training set. The sample selection strategy achieves promising
performance by selecting a label-reliable subset for model training. In this
paper, we empirically reveal that existing sample selection methods suffer from
both data and training bias that are represented as imbalanced selected sets
and accumulation errors in practice, respectively. However, only the training
bias was handled in previous studies. To address this limitation, we propose a
noIse-Tolerant Expert Model (ITEM) for debiased learning in sample selection.
Specifically, to mitigate the training bias, we design a robust network
architecture that integrates with multiple experts. Compared with the
prevailing double-branch network, our network exhibits better performance of
selection and prediction by ensembling these experts while training with fewer
parameters. Meanwhile, to mitigate the data bias, we propose a mixed sampling
strategy based on two weight-based data samplers. By training on the mixture of
two class-discriminative mini-batches, the model mitigates the effect of the
imbalanced training set while avoiding sparse representations that are easily
caused by sampling strategies. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate
the effectiveness of ITEM. Our code is available at this url

<p>Recently, optimization on the Riemannian manifold has provided new insights
to the optimization community. In this regard, the manifold taken as the
probability measure metric space equipped with the second-order Wasserstein
distance is of particular interest, since optimization on it can be linked to
practical sampling processes. In general, the oracle (continuous) optimization
method on Wasserstein space is Riemannian gradient flow (i.e., Langevin
dynamics when minimizing KL divergence). In this paper, we aim to enrich the
continuous optimization methods in the Wasserstein space by extending the
gradient flow into the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) flow and stochastic
variance reduction gradient (SVRG) flow. The two flows on Euclidean space are
standard stochastic optimization methods, while their Riemannian counterparts
are not explored yet. By leveraging the structures in Wasserstein space, we
construct a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to approximate the discrete
dynamics of desired stochastic methods in the corresponded random vector space.
Then, the flows of probability measures are naturally obtained by applying
Fokker-Planck equation to such SDE. Furthermore, the convergence rates of the
proposed Riemannian stochastic flows are proven, and they match the results in
Euclidean space.

<p>In this work we demonstrate that significant gains in performance and data

standard paradigm of sequential optimization or reconstruction and analysis
components. We conceptually connect HEP reconstruction and analysis to modern
machine learning workflows such as pretraining, finetuning, domain adaptation
and high-dimensional embedding spaces and quantify the gains in the example
usecase of searches of heavy resonances decaying via an intermediate di-Higgs

<p>We propose masked particle modeling (MPM) as a self-supervised method for
learning generic, transferable, and reusable representations on unordered sets
of inputs for use in high energy physics (HEP) scientific data. This work
provides a novel scheme to perform masked modeling based pre-training to learn
permutation invariant functions on sets. More generally, this work provides a
step towards building large foundation models for HEP that can be generically
pre-trained with self-supervised learning and later fine-tuned for a variety of
down-stream tasks. In MPM, particles in a set are masked and the training
objective is to recover their identity, as defined by a discretized token
representation of a pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoder. We
study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider
physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization,
permutation invariance, and ordering. We also study the fine-tuning capability
of the model, showing that it can be adapted to tasks such as supervised and
weakly supervised jet classification, and that the model can transfer
efficiently with small fine-tuning data sets to new classes and new data
domains.

<p>In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the discontinuity
interfaces of a discontinuous function. This approach leverages Graph-Informed
Neural Networks (GINNs) and sparse grids to address discontinuity detection
also in domains of dimension larger than 3. GINNs, trained to identify troubled

efficient and accurate discontinuity detection performances. We also introduce
a recursive algorithm for general sparse grid-based detectors, characterized by
convergence properties and easy applicability. Numerical experiments on
functions with dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 demonstrate the efficiency and robust
generalization of GINNs in detecting discontinuity interfaces. Notably, the
trained GINNs offer portability and versatility, allowing integration into

<p>Widespread adoption of AI for medical decision making is still hindered due
to ethical and safety-related concerns. For AI-based decision support systems
in healthcare settings it is paramount to be reliable and trustworthy. Common
deep learning approaches, however, have the tendency towards overconfidence
under data shift. Such inappropriate extrapolation beyond evidence-based
scenarios may have dire consequences. This highlights the importance of
reliable estimation of local uncertainty and its communication to the end user.
While stochastic neural networks have been heralded as a potential solution to
these issues, this study investigates their actual reliability in clinical
applications. We centered our analysis on the exemplary use case of mortality
prediction for ICU hospitalizations using EHR from MIMIC3 study. For
predictions on the EHR time series, Encoder-Only Transformer models were
employed. Stochasticity of model functions was achieved by incorporating common
methods such as Bayesian neural network layers and model ensembles. Our models
achieve state of the art performance in terms of discrimination performance
(AUC ROC: 0.868+-0.011, AUC PR: 0.554+-0.034) and calibration on the mortality
prediction benchmark. However, epistemic uncertainty is critically
underestimated by the selected stochastic deep learning methods. A heuristic
proof for the responsible collapse of the posterior distribution is provided.
Our findings reveal the inadequacy of commonly used stochastic deep learning
approaches to reliably recognize OoD samples. In both methods, unsubstantiated
model confidence is not prevented due to strongly biased functional posteriors,
rendering them inappropriate for reliable clinical decision support. This
highlights the need for approaches with more strictly enforced or inherent
distance-awareness to known data points, e.g., using kernel-based techniques.

<p>The exorbitant cost of training Large language models (LLMs) from scratch
makes it essential to fingerprint the models to protect intellectual property
via ownership authentication and to ensure downstream users and developers
comply with their license terms (e.g. restricting commercial use). In this
study, we present a pilot study on LLM fingerprinting as a form of very
lightweight instruction tuning. Model publisher specifies a confidential
private key and implants it as an instruction backdoor that causes the LLM to
generate specific text when the key is present. Results on 11 popularly-used
LLMs showed that this approach is lightweight and does not affect the normal
behavior of the model. It also prevents publisher overclaim, maintains
robustness against fingerprint guessing and parameter-efficient training, and
supports multi-stage fingerprinting akin to MIT License. Code is available in

<p>Robot co-design, where the morphology of a robot is optimized jointly with a
learned policy to solve a specific task, is an emerging area of research. It
holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel
manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators.
Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step
further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can
change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of
reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL)
problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in
the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum
that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of
the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark
for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to
accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine
algorithm on DittoGym and demonstrate robots that learn to change their
morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL
algorithm. More results are available at https://dittogym.github.io.
