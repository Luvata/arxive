<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Le, Jason Xie, William Liang, Hung-Ju Wang, Yue Yang, Yecheng Jason Ma, Kyle Vedder, Arjun Krishna, Dinesh Jayaraman, Eric Eaton</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive 3D simulated objects are crucial in AR/VR, animations, and robotics, driving immersive experiences and advanced automation. However, creating these articulated objects requires extensive human effort and expertise, limiting their broader applications. To overcome this challenge, we present Articulate-Anything, a system that automates the articulation of diverse, complex objects from many input modalities, including text, images, and videos. Articulate-Anything leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that can be compiled into an interactable digital twin for use in standard 3D simulators. Our system exploits existing 3D asset datasets via a mesh retrieval mechanism, along with an actor-critic system that iteratively proposes, evaluates, and refines solutions for articulating the objects, self-correcting errors to achieve a robust outcome. Qualitative evaluations demonstrate Articulate-Anything's capability to articulate complex and even ambiguous object affordances by leveraging rich grounded inputs. In extensive quantitative experiments on the standard PartNet-Mobility dataset, Articulate-Anything substantially outperforms prior work, increasing the success rate from 8.7-11.6% to 75% and setting a new bar for state-of-the-art performance. We further showcase the utility of our generated assets by using them to train robotic policies for fine-grained manipulation tasks that go beyond basic pick and place.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13883">Transformers Utilization in Chart Understanding: A Review of Recent Advances &amp; Future Trends</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirna Al-Shetairy, Hanan Hindy, Dina Khattab, Mostafa M. Aref</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, interest in vision-language tasks has grown, especially those involving chart interactions. These tasks are inherently multimodal, requiring models to process chart images, accompanying text, underlying data tables, and often user queries. Traditionally, Chart Understanding (CU) relied on heuristics and rule-based systems. However, recent advancements that have integrated transformer architectures significantly improved performance. This paper reviews prominent research in CU, focusing on State-of-The-Art (SoTA) frameworks that employ transformers within End-to-End (E2E) solutions. Relevant benchmarking datasets and evaluation techniques are analyzed. Additionally, this article identifies key challenges and outlines promising future directions for advancing CU solutions. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search is conducted across Google Scholar, focusing on publications from Jan'20 to Jun'24. After rigorous screening and quality assessment, 32 studies are selected for in-depth analysis. The CU tasks are categorized into a three-layered paradigm based on the cognitive task required. Recent advancements in the frameworks addressing various CU tasks are also reviewed. Frameworks are categorized into single-task or multi-task based on the number of tasks solvable by the E2E solution. Within multi-task frameworks, pre-trained and prompt-engineering-based techniques are explored. This review overviews leading architectures, datasets, and pre-training tasks. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in OCR dependency, handling low-resolution images, and enhancing visual reasoning. Future directions include addressing these challenges, developing robust benchmarks, and optimizing model efficiency. Additionally, integrating explainable AI techniques and exploring the balance between real and synthetic data are crucial for advancing CU research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Kwon, Hanbyul Joo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent generative models can synthesize high-quality images but often fail to generate humans interacting with objects using their hands. This arises mostly from the model's misunderstanding of such interactions, and the hardships of synthesizing intricate regions of the body. In this paper, we propose GraspDiffusion, a novel generative method that creates realistic scenes of human-object interaction. Given a 3D object mesh, GraspDiffusion first constructs life-like whole-body poses with control over the object's location relative to the human body. This is achieved by separately leveraging the generative priors for 3D body and hand poses, optimizing them into a joint grasping pose. The resulting pose guides the image synthesis to correctly reflect the intended interaction, allowing the creation of realistic and diverse human-object interaction scenes. We demonstrate that GraspDiffusion can successfully tackle the relatively uninvestigated problem of generating full-bodied human-object interactions while outperforming previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangda Ji, Silvan Weder, Francis Engelmann, Marc Pollefeys, Hermann Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of neural networks scales with both their size and the amount of data they have been trained on. This is shown in both language and image generation. However, this requires scaling-friendly network architectures as well as large-scale datasets. Even though scaling-friendly architectures like transformers have emerged for 3D vision tasks, the GPT-moment of 3D vision remains distant due to the lack of training data. In this paper, we introduce ARKit LabelMaker, the first large-scale, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations. Specifically, we complement ARKitScenes dataset with dense semantic annotations that are automatically generated at scale. To this end, we extend LabelMaker, a recent automatic annotation pipeline, to serve the needs of large-scale pre-training. This involves extending the pipeline with cutting-edge segmentation models as well as making it robust to the challenges of large-scale processing. Further, we push forward the state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and ScanNet200 dataset with prevalent 3D semantic segmentation models, demonstrating the efficacy of our generated dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Chen, Zaixi Shang, Jae Won Chung, David Lerner, Werner Robitza, Rakesh Rao Ramachandra Rao, Alexander Raake, Alan C. Bovik</p>
<p>Abstract: Demand for streaming services, including satellite, continues to exhibit unprecedented growth. Internet Service Providers find themselves at the crossroads of technological advancements and rising customer expectations. To stay relevant and competitive, these ISPs must ensure their networks deliver optimal video streaming quality, a key determinant of user satisfaction. Towards this end, it is important to have accurate Quality of Experience prediction models in place. However, achieving robust performance by these models requires extensive data sets labeled by subjective opinion scores on videos impaired by diverse playback disruptions. To bridge this data gap, we introduce the LIVE-Viasat Real-World Satellite QoE Database. This database consists of 179 videos recorded from real-world streaming services affected by various authentic distortion patterns. We also conducted a comprehensive subjective study involving 54 participants, who contributed both continuous-time opinion scores and endpoint (retrospective) QoE scores. Our analysis sheds light on various determinants influencing subjective QoE, such as stall events, spatial resolutions, bitrate, and certain network parameters. We demonstrate the usefulness of this unique new resource by evaluating the efficacy of prevalent QoE-prediction models on it. We also created a new model that maps the network parameters to predicted human perception scores, which can be used by ISPs to optimize the video streaming quality of their networks. Our proposed model, which we call SatQA, is able to accurately predict QoE using only network parameters, without any access to pixel data or video-specific metadata, estimated by Spearman's Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC), Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), indicating high accuracy and reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neale Ratzlaff, Matthew Lyle Olson, Musashi Hinck, Shao-Yen Tseng, Vasudev Lal, Phillip Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA have demonstrated impressive capabilities as general-purpose chatbots that can engage in conversations about a provided input image. However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a novel debiasing framework for LVLMs by directly ablating biased attributes during text generation to avoid generating text related to protected attributes, or even representing them internally. Our method requires no training and a relatively small amount of representative biased outputs (~1000 samples). Our experiments show that not only can we can minimize the propensity of LVLMs to generate text related to protected attributes, but we can even use synthetic data to inform the ablation while retaining captioning performance on real data such as COCO. Furthermore, we find the resulting generations from a debiased LVLM exhibit similar accuracy as a baseline biased model, showing that debiasing effects can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing reproducibility crisis in machine learning has brought forward a need for careful examination of research findings. This paper investigates the claims made by Lei et al. (2023) regarding their proposed method, LICO, for enhancing post-hoc interpretability techniques and improving image classification performance. LICO leverages natural language supervision from a vision-language model to enrich feature representations and guide the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study, employing (Wide) ResNets and established interpretability methods like Grad-CAM and RISE. We were mostly unable to reproduce the authors' results. In particular, we did not find that LICO consistently led to improved classification performance or improvements in quantitative and qualitative measures of interpretability. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous evaluation and transparent reporting in interpretability research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14017">Probabilistic U-Net with Kendall Shape Spaces for Geometry-Aware Segmentations of Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyoung Park, G\"unay Do\u{g}an</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in computer vision is image segmentation, the task of detecting distinct regions or objects in given images. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been shown to be very effective in segmenting challenging images, producing convincing segmentations. There is further need for probabilistic DNNs that can reflect the uncertainties from the input images and the models into the computed segmentations, in other words, new DNNs that can generate multiple plausible segmentations and their distributions depending on the input or the model uncertainties. While there are existing probabilistic segmentation models, many of them do not take into account the geometry or shape underlying the segmented regions. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic image segmentation model that can incorporate the geometry of a segmentation. Our proposed model builds on the Probabilistic U-Net of \cite{kohl2018probabilistic} to generate probabilistic segmentations, i.e.\! multiple likely segmentations for an input image. Our model also adopts the Kendall Shape Variational Auto-Encoder of \cite{vadgama2023kendall} to encode a Kendall shape space in the latent variable layers of the prior and posterior networks of the Probabilistic U-Net. Incorporating the shape space in this manner leads to a more robust segmentation with spatially coherent regions, respecting the underlying geometry in the input images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teerath Kumar, Alessandra Mileo, Malika Bendechache</p>
<p>Abstract: Geographical, gender and stereotypical biases in computer vision models pose significant challenges to their performance and fairness. {In this study, we present an approach named FaceSaliencyAug aimed at addressing the gender bias in} {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Leveraging the salient regions} { of faces detected by saliency, the propose approach mitigates geographical and stereotypical biases } {in the datasets. FaceSaliencyAug} randomly selects masks from a predefined search space and applies them to the salient region of face images, subsequently restoring the original image with masked salient region. {The proposed} augmentation strategy enhances data diversity, thereby improving model performance and debiasing effects. We quantify dataset diversity using Image Similarity Score (ISS) across five datasets, including Flickr Faces HQ (FFHQ), WIKI, IMDB, Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW), UTK Faces, and Diverse Dataset. The proposed approach demonstrates superior diversity metrics, as evaluated by ISS-intra and ISS-inter algorithms. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating gender bias on CEO, Engineer, Nurse, and School Teacher datasets. We use the Image-Image Association Score (IIAS) to measure gender bias in these occupations. Our experiments reveal a reduction in gender bias for both CNNs and ViTs, indicating the efficacy of our method in promoting fairness and inclusivity in computer vision models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14072">Efficient Vision-Language Models by Summarizing Visual Tokens into Compact Registers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Wen, Qingqing Cao, Qichen Fu, Sachin Mehta, Mahyar Najibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded their potential for real-world applications, enabling these models to perform complex reasoning on images. In the widely used fully autoregressive transformer-based models like LLaVA, projected visual tokens are prepended to textual tokens. Oftentimes, visual tokens are significantly more than prompt tokens, resulting in increased computational overhead during both training and inference. In this paper, we propose Visual Compact Token Registers (Victor), a method that reduces the number of visual tokens by summarizing them into a smaller set of register tokens. Victor adds a few learnable register tokens after the visual tokens and summarizes the visual information into these registers using the first few layers in the language tower of VLMs. After these few layers, all visual tokens are discarded, significantly improving computational efficiency for both training and inference. Notably, our method is easy to implement and requires a small number of new trainable parameters with minimal impact on model performance. In our experiment, with merely 8 visual registers--about 1% of the original tokens--Victor shows less than a 4% accuracy drop while reducing the total training time by 43% and boosting the inference throughput by 3.3X.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Huang, Tingfa Xu, Ziyi Shen, Shaheer Ullah Saeed, Wen Yan, Dean Barratt, Yipeng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes a new spatial correspondence representation based on paired regions-of-interest (ROIs), for medical image registration. The distinct properties of the proposed ROI-based correspondence are discussed, in the context of potential benefits in clinical applications following image registration, compared with alternative correspondence-representing approaches, such as those based on sampled displacements and spatial transformation functions. These benefits include a clear connection between learning-based image registration and segmentation, which in turn motivates two cases of image registration approaches using (pre-)trained segmentation networks. Based on the segment anything model (SAM), a vision foundation model for segmentation, we develop a new registration algorithm SAMReg, which does not require any training (or training data), gradient-based fine-tuning or prompt engineering. The proposed SAMReg models are evaluated across five real-world applications, including intra-subject registration tasks with cardiac MR and lung CT, challenging inter-subject registration scenarios with prostate MR and retinal imaging, and an additional evaluation with a non-clinical example with aerial image registration. The proposed methods outperform both intensity-based iterative algorithms and DDF-predicting learning-based networks across tested metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, and further demonstrates competitive performance compared to weakly-supervised registration approaches that rely on fully-segmented training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxin Liu, Zhongliang Guo, Siyuan Huang, Chun Pong Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they remain susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which pose significant risks in safety-critical applications. With the rise of multimodality, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools not only for generative tasks but also for various applications such as image editing, inpainting, and super-resolution. However, these models still lack robustness due to limited research on attacking them to enhance their resilience. Traditional attack techniques, such as gradient-based adversarial attacks and diffusion model-based methods, are hindered by computational inefficiencies and scalability issues due to their iterative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework that leverages the distilled backbone of diffusion models and incorporates a precision-optimized noise predictor to enhance the effectiveness of our attack framework. This approach not only enhances the attack's potency but also significantly reduces computational costs. Our framework provides a cutting-edge solution for multi-modal adversarial attacks, ensuring reduced latency and the generation of high-fidelity adversarial examples with superior success rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework achieves outstanding transferability and robustness against purification defenses, outperforming existing gradient-based attack models in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kosuke Tatsumura, Yohei Hamakawa, Masaya Yamasaki, Koji Oya, Hiroshi Fujimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: A cognitive function of tracking multiple objects, needed in autonomous mobile vehicles, comprises object detection and their temporal association. While great progress owing to machine learning has been recently seen for elaborating the similarity matrix between the objects that have been recognized and the objects detected in a current video frame, less for the assignment problem that finally determines the temporal association, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. Here we show an in-vehicle multiple object tracking system with a flexible assignment function for tracking through multiple long-term occlusion events. To solve the flexible assignment problem formulated as a nondeterministic polynomial time-hard problem, the system relies on an embeddable Ising machine based on a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation. Using a vehicle-mountable computing platform, we demonstrate a realtime system-wide throughput (23 frames per second on average) with the enhanced functionality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14103">Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting using Multi-Task Latent Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Chaorong, Ling Xudong, Yang Qiang, Qin Fengqing, Huang Yuanyuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have made remarkable strides in precipitation prediction, yet they continue to struggle with capturing the spatial details of the features of radar images, particularly over high precipitation intensity areas. This shortcoming is evident in the form of low forecast accuracy in the spatial positioning of radar echo images across varying precipitation intensity regions. To address this challenge, we introduce the multi-task latent diffusion model(MTLDM), a novel approach for precipitation prediction. The basic concept of the MTLDM is based on the understanding that the radar image representing precipitation is the result of multiple factors. Therefore, we adopt a divide-and-conquer approach, that is, we decompose the radar image using decomposition technology and then predict the decomposed sub-images separately. We conceptualize the precipitation image as a composition of various components corresponding to different precipitation intensities. The MTLDM decomposes the precipitation image into these distinct components and employs a dedicated task to predict each one. This method enables spatiotemporally consistent prediction of real-world precipitation areas up to 5-80 min in advance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nghia Hieu Nguyen, Tho Thanh Quan, Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based VQA is a challenging task that requires machines to use scene texts in given images to yield the most appropriate answer for the given question. The main challenge of text-based VQA is exploiting the meaning and information from scene texts. Recent studies tackled this challenge by considering the spatial information of scene texts in images via embedding 2D coordinates of their bounding boxes. In this study, we follow the definition of meaning from linguistics to introduce a novel method that effectively exploits the information from scene texts written in Vietnamese. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtains state-of-the-art results on two large-scale Vietnamese Text-based VQA datasets. The implementation can be found at this link.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingqi Zhou, Sheng Wang, Jingwei Dong, Lei Li, Jiahui Gao, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited multi-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing multi-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the assistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15% on MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhe Ding, Jianlong Wu, Xue Dong, Xiaojie Li, Pengda Qin, Tian Gan, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a mainstream algorithm in model compression by transferring knowledge from the larger model (teacher) to the smaller model (student) to improve the performance of student. Despite many efforts, existing methods mainly investigate the consistency between instance-level feature representation or prediction, which neglects the category-level information and the difficulty of each sample, leading to undesirable performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel preview-based category contrastive learning method for knowledge distillation (PCKD). It first distills the structural knowledge of both instance-level feature correspondence and the relation between instance features and category centers in a contrastive learning fashion, which can explicitly optimize the category representation and explore the distinct correlation between representations of instances and categories, contributing to discriminative category centers and better classification results. Besides, we introduce a novel preview strategy to dynamically determine how much the student should learn from each sample according to their difficulty. Different from existing methods that treat all samples equally and curriculum learning that simply filters out hard samples, our method assigns a small weight for hard instances as a preview to better guide the student training. Extensive experiments on several challenging datasets, including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, demonstrate the superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhang Cui, An Zhang, Yiyang Zhou, Zhaorun Chen, Gelei Deng, Huaxiu Yao, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained vision models have accelerated the development of vision-language large models (VLLMs), enhancing the interaction between visual and linguistic modalities. Despite their notable success across various domains, VLLMs face challenges in modality alignment, which can lead to issues like hallucinations and unsafe content generation. Current alignment techniques often rely on coarse feedback and external datasets, limiting scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose FiSAO (Fine-Grained Self-Alignment Optimization), a novel self-alignment method that utilizes the model's own visual encoder as a fine-grained verifier to improve vision-language alignment without the need for additional data. By leveraging token-level feedback from the vision encoder, FiSAO significantly improves vision-language alignment, even surpassing traditional preference tuning methods that require additional data. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that FiSAO effectively addresses the misalignment problem in VLLMs, marking the first instance of token-level rewards being applied to such models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H\'ector Laria, Alex Gomez-Villa, Imad Eddine Marouf, Kai Wang, Bogdan Raducanu, Joost van de Weijer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced image generation capabilities. However, customizing these models with new classes often leads to unintended consequences that compromise their reliability. We introduce the concept of open-world forgetting to emphasize the vast scope of these unintended alterations, contrasting it with the well-studied closed-world forgetting, which is measurable by evaluating performance on a limited set of classes or skills. Our research presents the first comprehensive investigation into open-world forgetting in diffusion models, focusing on semantic and appearance drift of representations. We utilize zero-shot classification to analyze semantic drift, revealing that even minor model adaptations lead to unpredictable shifts affecting areas far beyond newly introduced concepts, with dramatic drops in zero-shot classification of up to 60%. Additionally, we observe significant changes in texture and color of generated content when analyzing appearance drift. To address these issues, we propose a mitigation strategy based on functional regularization, designed to preserve original capabilities while accommodating new concepts. Our study aims to raise awareness of unintended changes due to model customization and advocates for the analysis of open-world forgetting in future research on model customization and finetuning methods. Furthermore, we provide insights for developing more robust adaptation methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renguang Chen, Guolong Zheng, Xu Yang, Zhide Chen, Jiwu Shu, Wencheng Yang, Kexin Zhu, Chen Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing popularity of online sports and exercise necessitates effective methods for evaluating the quality of online exercise executions. Previous action quality assessment methods, which relied on labeled scores from motion videos, exhibited slightly lower accuracy and discriminability. This limitation hindered their rapid application to newly added exercises. To address this problem, this paper presents an unlabeled Multi-Dimensional Exercise Distance Adaptive Constrained Dynamic Time Warping (MED-ACDTW) method for action quality assessment. Our approach uses an athletic version of DTW to compare features from template and test videos, eliminating the need for score labels during training. The result shows that utilizing both 2D and 3D spatial dimensions, along with multiple human body features, improves the accuracy by 2-3% compared to using either 2D or 3D pose estimation alone. Additionally, employing MED for score calculation enhances the precision of frame distance matching, which significantly boosts overall discriminability. The adaptive constraint scheme enhances the discriminability of action quality assessment by approximately 30%. Furthermore, to address the absence of a standardized perspective in sports class evaluations, we introduce a new dataset called BGym.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ange Lou, Benjamin Planche, Zhongpai Gao, Yamin Li, Tianyu Luan, Hao Ding, Meng Zheng, Terrence Chen, Ziyan Wu, Jack Noble</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous recent approaches to modeling and re-rendering dynamic scenes leverage plane-based explicit representations, addressing slow training times associated with models like neural radiance fields (NeRF) and Gaussian splatting (GS). However, merely decomposing 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations is insufficient for high-fidelity re-rendering of scenes with complex motions. In response, we present DaRePlane, a novel direction-aware representation approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. Within NeRF pipelines, DaRePlane computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes, then passed to a tiny MLP for color regression. When applied to Gaussian splatting, DaRePlane computes the features of Gaussian points, followed by a tiny multi-head MLP for spatial-time deformation prediction. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. To demonstrate the generality and efficiency of DaRePlane, we test it on both regular and surgical dynamic scenes, for both NeRF and GS systems. Extensive experiments show that DaRePlane yields state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for various complex dynamic scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younggeol Cho, Youngrae Kim, Junho Yoon, Seunghoon Hong, Dongman Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) allows a model to be adapted to an unseen domain without accessing the source data. Due to the nature of practical environments, TTA has a limited amount of data for adaptation. Recent TTA methods further restrict this by filtering input data for reliability, making the effective data size even smaller and limiting adaptation potential. To address this issue, We propose Feature Augmentation based Test-time Adaptation (FATA), a simple method that fully utilizes the limited amount of input data through feature augmentation. FATA employs Normalization Perturbation to augment features and adapts the model using the FATA loss, which makes the outputs of the augmented and original features similar. FATA is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing models without altering the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FATA on various models and scenarios on ImageNet-C and Office-Home, validating its superiority in diverse real-world conditions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14189">Neural Signed Distance Function Inference through Splatting 3D Gaussians Pulled on Zero-Level Set</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Zhang, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: It is vital to infer a signed distance function (SDF) in multi-view based surface reconstruction. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) provides a novel perspective for volume rendering, and shows advantages in rendering efficiency and quality. Although 3DGS provides a promising neural rendering option, it is still hard to infer SDFs for surface reconstruction with 3DGS due to the discreteness, the sparseness, and the off-surface drift of 3D Gaussians. To resolve these issues, we propose a method that seamlessly merge 3DGS with the learning of neural SDFs. Our key idea is to more effectively constrain the SDF inference with the multi-view consistency. To this end, we dynamically align 3D Gaussians on the zero-level set of the neural SDF using neural pulling, and then render the aligned 3D Gaussians through the differentiable rasterization. Meanwhile, we update the neural SDF by pulling neighboring space to the pulled 3D Gaussians, which progressively refine the signed distance field near the surface. With both differentiable pulling and splatting, we jointly optimize 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF with both RGB and geometry constraints, which recovers more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with more geometry details. Our numerical and visual comparisons show our superiority over the state-of-the-art results on the widely used benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honglin Li, Yunlong Zhang, Pingyi Chen, Zhongyi Shui, Chenglu Zhu, Lin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard for clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop computer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level labels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise interactions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority. Our code will be available at github.com/invoker-LL/Long-MIL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Annotating 3D medical images demands expert knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have gained significant interest in 3D medical image segmentation. The significant size differences among various organs in the human body lead to imbalanced class distribution, which is a major challenge in the real-world application of these SSL approaches. To address this issue, we develop a novel Shape Transformation driven by Active Contour (STAC), that enlarges smaller organs to alleviate imbalanced class distribution across different organs. Inspired by curve evolution theory in active contour methods, STAC employs a signed distance function (SDF) as the level set function, to implicitly represent the shape of organs, and deforms voxels in the direction of the steepest descent of SDF (i.e., the normal vector). To ensure that the voxels far from expansion organs remain unchanged, we design an SDF-based weight function to control the degree of deformation for each voxel. We then use STAC as a data-augmentation process during the training stage. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghao Pan, Haijin Zeng, Jiezhang Cao, Yongyong Chen, Kai Zhang, Yong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Color video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) employs computational imaging techniques to capture multiple sequential video frames in a single Bayer-patterned measurement. With the increasing popularity of quad-Bayer pattern in mainstream smartphone cameras for capturing high-resolution videos, mobile photography has become more accessible to a wider audience. However, existing color video SCI reconstruction algorithms are designed based on the traditional Bayer pattern. When applied to videos captured by quad-Bayer cameras, these algorithms often result in color distortion and ineffective demosaicing, rendering them impractical for primary equipment. To address this challenge, we propose the MambaSCI method, which leverages the Mamba and UNet architectures for efficient reconstruction of quad-Bayer patterned color video SCI. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first algorithm for quad-Bayer patterned SCI reconstruction, and also the initial application of the Mamba model to this task. Specifically, we customize Residual-Mamba-Blocks, which residually connect the Spatial-Temporal Mamba (STMamba), Edge-Detail-Reconstruction (EDR) module, and Channel Attention (CA) module. Respectively, STMamba is used to model long-range spatial-temporal dependencies with linear complexity, EDR is for better edge-detail reconstruction, and CA is used to compensate for the missing channel information interaction in Mamba model. Experiments demonstrate that MambaSCI surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower computational and memory costs. PyTorch style pseudo-code for the core modules is provided in the supplementary materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enqi Liu, Liyuan Pan, Yan Yang, Yiran Zhong, Zhijing Wu, Xinxiao Wu, Liu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained video action recognition can be conceptualized as a video-text matching problem. Previous approaches often rely on global video semantics to consolidate video embeddings, which can lead to misalignment in video-text pairs due to a lack of understanding of action semantics at an atomic granularity level. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-granularity framework based on two observations: (i) videos with different global semantics may share similar atomic actions or appearances, and (ii) atomic actions within a video can be momentary, slow, or even non-directly related to the global video semantics. Inspired by the concept of storyboarding, which disassembles a script into individual shots, we enhance global video semantics by generating fine-grained descriptions using a pre-trained large language model. These detailed descriptions capture common atomic actions depicted in videos. A filtering metric is proposed to select the descriptions that correspond to the atomic actions present in both the videos and the descriptions. By employing global semantics and fine-grained descriptions, we can identify key frames in videos and utilize them to aggregate embeddings, thereby making the embedding more accurate. Extensive experiments on various video action recognition datasets demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Zia-ur-Rehman, Arif Mahmood, Wenxiong Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning systems have gained significant attention in recent years by leveraging clustering-based pseudo-labels to provide supervision without the need for human annotations. However, the noise in these pseudo-labels caused by the clustering methods poses a challenge to the learning process leading to degraded performance. In this work, we propose a pseudo-label refinement (SLR) algorithm to address this issue. The cluster labels from the previous epoch are projected to the current epoch cluster-labels space and a linear combination of the new label and the projected label is computed as a soft refined label containing the information from the previous epoch clusters as well as from the current epoch. In contrast to the common practice of using the maximum value as a cluster/class indicator, we employ hierarchical clustering on these soft pseudo-labels to generate refined hard-labels. This approach better utilizes the information embedded in the soft labels, outperforming the simple maximum value approach for hard label generation. The effectiveness of the proposed SLR algorithm is evaluated in the context of person re-identification (Re-ID) using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Experimental results demonstrate that the modified Re-ID baseline, incorporating the SLR algorithm, achieves significantly improved mean Average Precision (mAP) performance in various UDA tasks, including real-to-synthetic, synthetic-to-real, and different real-to-real scenarios. These findings highlight the efficacy of the SLR algorithm in enhancing the performance of self-supervised learning systems.</p>

Through an innovative training procedure with increasing difficulty, it is able to learn to recognize suitable parts relying only on shape context. Thanks to its low parameter size and computational requirements, it can be used to sort through a warehouse of potentially tens of thousand of spare parts in just a few seconds. We also establish an alternative baseline approach to compare against, and extensively document the unique challenges associated with this task, as well as identify the design choices to solve them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jimin Dai, Yingzhen Zhang, Shuo Chen, Jian Yang, Lei Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have been successfully applied to real image editing. These models typically invert images into latent noise vectors used to reconstruct the original images (known as inversion), and then edit them during the inference process. However, recent popular DMs often rely on the assumption of local linearization, where the noise injected during the inversion process is expected to approximate the noise removed during the inference process. While DM efficiently generates images under this assumption, it can also accumulate errors during the diffusion process due to the assumption, ultimately negatively impacting the quality of real image reconstruction and editing. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, referred to as ERDDCI (Exact Reversible Diffusion via Dual-Chain Inversion). ERDDCI uses the new Dual-Chain Inversion (DCI) for joint inference to derive an exact reversible diffusion process. By using DCI, our method effectively avoids the cumbersome optimization process in existing inversion approaches and achieves high-quality image editing. Additionally, to accommodate image operations under high guidance scales, we introduce a dynamic control strategy that enables more refined image reconstruction and editing. Our experiments demonstrate that ERDDCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a 50-step diffusion process. It achieves rapid and precise image reconstruction with an SSIM of 0.999 and an LPIPS of 0.001, and also delivers competitive results in image editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Wenguan Wang, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to execute actions following human instructions. Existing VLN models are optimized through expert demonstrations by supervised behavioural cloning or incorporating manual reward engineering. While straightforward, these efforts overlook the accumulation of errors in the Markov decision process, and struggle to match the distribution of the expert policy. Going beyond this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (ENP) to model the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model. At each step, low energy values correspond to the state-action pairs that the expert is most likely to perform, and vice versa. Theoretically, the optimization objective is equivalent to minimizing the forward divergence between the occupancy measure of the expert and ours. Consequently, ENP learns to globally align with the expert policy by maximizing the likelihood of the actions and modeling the dynamics of the navigation states in a collaborative manner. With a variety of VLN architectures, ENP achieves promising performances on R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and R2R-CE, unleashing the power of existing VLN models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, personalized diffusion-based text-to-image generative tasks have been a hot topic in computer vision studies. A robust diffusion model is determined by its ability to perform near-perfect reconstruction of certain product outcomes given few related input samples. Unfortunately, the current prominent diffusion-based finetuning technique falls short in maintaining the foreground object consistency while being constrained to produce diverse backgrounds in the image outcome. In the worst scenario, the overfitting issue may occur, meaning that the foreground object is less controllable due to the condition above, for example, the input prompt information is transferred ambiguously to both foreground and background regions, instead of the supposed background region only. To tackle the issues above, we proposed Hypnos, a highly precise foreground-focused diffusion finetuning technique. On the image level, this strategy works best for inanimate object generation tasks, and to do so, Hypnos implements two main approaches, namely: (i) a content-centric prompting strategy and (ii) the utilization of our additional foreground-focused discriminative module. The utilized module is connected with the diffusion model and finetuned with our proposed set of supervision mechanism. Combining the strategies above yielded to the foreground-background disentanglement capability of the diffusion model. Our experimental results showed that the proposed strategy gave a more robust performance and visually pleasing results compared to the former technique.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wan, Peng-Tao Jiang, Qibin Hou, Hao Zhang, Jinwei Chen, Ming-Ming Cheng, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ClearSR, a new method that can better take advantage of latent low-resolution image (LR) embeddings for diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR). Previous Real-ISR models mostly focus on how to activate more generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models to make the output high-resolution (HR) images look better. However, since these methods rely too much on the generative priors, the content of the output images is often inconsistent with the input LR ones. To mitigate the above issue, in this work, we explore using latent LR embeddings to constrain the control signals from ControlNet, and extract LR information at both detail and structure levels. We show that the proper use of latent LR embeddings can produce higher-quality control signals, which enables the super-resolution results to be more consistent with the LR image and leads to clearer visual results. In addition, we also show that latent LR embeddings can be used to control the inference stage, allowing for the improvement of fidelity and generation ability simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance across multiple metrics on several test sets and generate more consistent SR results with LR images than existing methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Yamani, Nehal Al-Otaiby, Haifa Al-Shemmeri, Imane Boudellioua</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient identification of the root causes of drill bit failure is crucial due to potential impacts such as operational losses, safety threats, and delays. Early recognition of these failures enables proactive maintenance, reducing risks and financial losses associated with unforeseen breakdowns and prolonged downtime. Thus, our study investigates various causes of drill bit failure using images of different blades. The process involves annotating cutters with their respective locations and damage types, followed by the development of two YOLO Location and Damage Cutter Detection models, as well as multi-class multi-label Decision Tree and Random Forests models to identify the causes of failure by assessing the cutters' location and damage type. Additionally, RRFCI is proposed for the classification of failure causes. Notably, the cutter location detection model achieved a high score of 0.97 mPA, and the cutter damage detection model yielded a 0.49 mPA. The rule-based approach over-performed both DT and RF in failure cause identification, achieving a macro-average F1-score of 0.94 across all damage causes. The integration of the complete automated pipeline successfully identified 100\% of the 24 failure causes when tested on independent sets of ten drill bits, showcasing its potential to efficiently assist experts in identifying the root causes of drill bit damages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Lin, Yanzhen Yu, Jianhao Ye, Ruitao Lv, Yuguang Yang, Ruoye Xie, Pan Yu, Hongbin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing audio-driven facial animation methods face critical challenges, including expression leakage, ineffective subtle expression transfer, and imprecise audio-driven synchronization. We discovered that these issues stem from limitations in motion representation and the lack of fine-grained control over facial expressions. To address these problems, we present Takin-ADA, a novel two-stage approach for real-time audio-driven portrait animation. In the first stage, we introduce a specialized loss function that enhances subtle expression transfer while reducing unwanted expression leakage. The second stage utilizes an advanced audio processing technique to improve lip-sync accuracy. Our method not only generates precise lip movements but also allows flexible control over facial expressions and head motions. Takin-ADA achieves high-resolution (512x512) facial animations at up to 42 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU, outperforming existing commercial solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly surpasses previous methods in video quality, facial dynamics realism, and natural head movements, setting a new benchmark in the field of audio-driven facial animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yugandhar Reddy Gogireddy, Jithendra Reddy Gogireddy</p>
<p>Abstract: The difficulties of underwater image degradation due to light scattering, absorption, and fog-like particles which lead to low resolution and poor visibility are discussed in this study report. We suggest a sophisticated hybrid strategy that combines Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) defogging methods with Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) to address these problems. The Retinex algorithm mimics human visual perception to reduce uneven lighting and fogging, while the SRCNN component improves the spatial resolution of underwater photos.Through the combination of these methods, we are able to enhance the clarity, contrast, and colour restoration of underwater images, offering a reliable way to improve image quality in difficult underwater conditions. The research conducts extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets to further illustrate the efficacy of the suggested approach. In terms of sharpness, visibility, and feature retention, quantitative evaluation which use metrics like the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) demonstrates notable advances over conventional techniques.In real-time underwater applications like marine exploration, underwater robotics, and autonomous underwater vehicles, where clear and high-resolution imaging is crucial for operational success, the combination of deep learning and conventional image processing techniques offers a computationally efficient framework with superior results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of layout-to-image generation involves synthesizing images based on the captions of objects and their spatial positions. Existing methods still struggle in complex layout generation, where common bad cases include object missing, inconsistent lighting, conflicting view angles, etc. To effectively address these issues, we propose a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Co}ntrollable (HiCo) diffusion model for layout-to-image generation, featuring object seperable conditioning branch structure. Our key insight is to achieve spatial disentanglement through hierarchical modeling of layouts. We use a multi branch structure to represent hierarchy and aggregate them in fusion module. To evaluate the performance of multi-objective controllable layout generation in natural scenes, we introduce the HiCo-7K benchmark, derived from the GRIT-20M dataset and manually cleaned. https://github.com/360CVGroup/HiCo_T2I.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Xie, Kaicheng Yang, Ninghua Yang, Weimo Deng, Xiangzi Dai, Tiancheng Gu, Yumeng Wang, Xiang An, Yongle Zhao, Ziyong Feng, Jiankang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing research primarily focuses on tuning language and image instructions, ignoring the critical pretraining phase where models learn to process textual and visual modalities jointly. In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for LMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically learnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part of the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens. Then, we conceptualize visual tokens as analogous to a "foreign language" for the LLMs and propose a mixed attention mechanism with bidirectional visual attention and unidirectional textual attention to comprehensively enhance the understanding of visual tokens. Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task, leveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual semantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible data, we present a new foundation model called Croc. Experimental results demonstrate that Croc achieves new state-of-the-art performance on massive vision-language benchmarks. To support reproducibility and facilitate further research, we release the training code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/deepglint/Croc.</p>

<p>Abstract: Animation data is often obtained through optical motion capture systems, which utilize a multitude of cameras to establish the position of optical markers. However, system errors or occlusions can result in missing markers, the manual cleaning of which can be time-consuming. This has sparked interest in machine learning-based solutions for missing marker reconstruction in the academic community. Most academic papers utilize a simplistic mean square error as the main metric. In this paper, we show that this metric does not correlate with subjective perception of the fill quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josiah Aklilu, Xiaohan Wang, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise action localization in untrimmed video is vital for fields such as professional sports and minimally invasive surgery, where the delineation of particular motions in recordings can dramatically enhance analysis. But in many cases, large scale datasets with video-label pairs for localization are unavailable, limiting the opportunity to fine-tune video-understanding models. Recent developments in large vision-language models (LVLM) address this need with impressive zero-shot capabilities in a variety of video understanding tasks. However, the adaptation of image-based LVLMs, with their powerful visual question answering capabilities, to action localization in long-form video is still relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce a true ZEro-shot Action Localization method (ZEAL). Specifically, we leverage the built-in action knowledge of a large language model (LLM) to inflate actions into highly-detailed descriptions of the archetypal start and end of the action. These descriptions serve as queries to LVLM for generating frame-level confidence scores which can be aggregated to produce localization outputs. The simplicity and flexibility of our method lends it amenable to more capable LVLMs as they are developed, and we demonstrate remarkable results in zero-shot action localization on a challenging benchmark, without any training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmentation and classification of large numbers of instances, such as cell nuclei, are crucial tasks in digital pathology for accurate diagnosis. However, the availability of high-quality datasets for deep learning methods is often limited due to the complexity of the annotation process. In this work, we investigate the impact of noisy annotations on the training and performance of a state-of-the-art CNN model for the combined task of detecting, segmenting and classifying nuclei in histopathology images. In this context, we investigate the conditions for determining an appropriate number of training epochs to prevent overfitting to annotation noise during training. Our results indicate that the utilisation of a small, correctly annotated validation set is instrumental in avoiding overfitting and maintaining model performance to a large extent. Additionally, our findings underscore the beneficial role of pre-training.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14379">AnomalyNCD: Towards Novel Anomaly Class Discovery in Industrial Scenarios</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Huang, Xurui Li, Haotian Liu, Feng Xue, Yuzhe Wang, Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In the industrial scenario, anomaly detection could locate but cannot classify anomalies. To complete their capability, we study to automatically discover and recognize visual classes of industrial anomalies. In terms of multi-class anomaly classification, previous methods cluster anomalies represented by frozen pre-trained models but often fail due to poor discrimination. Novel class discovery (NCD) has the potential to tackle this. However, it struggles with non-prominent and semantically weak anomalies that challenge network learning focus. To address these, we introduce AnomalyNCD, a multi-class anomaly classification framework compatible with existing anomaly detection methods. This framework learns anomaly-specific features and classifies anomalies in a self-supervised manner. Initially, a technique called Main Element Binarization (MEBin) is first designed, which segments primary anomaly regions into masks to alleviate the impact of incorrect detections on learning. Subsequently, we employ mask-guided contrastive representation learning to improve feature discrimination, which focuses network attention on isolated anomalous regions and reduces the confusion of erroneous inputs through re-corrected pseudo labels. Finally, to enable flexible classification at both region and image levels during inference, we develop a region merging strategy that determines the overall image category based on the classified anomaly regions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works on the MVTec AD and MTD datasets. Compared with the current methods, AnomalyNCD combined with zero-shot anomaly detection method achieves a 10.8% $F_1$ gain, 8.8% NMI gain, and 9.5% ARI gain on MVTec AD, 12.8% $F_1$ gain, 5.7% NMI gain, and 10.8% ARI gain on MTD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Koulischer, Johannes Deleu, Gabriel Raya, Thomas Demeester, Luca Ambrogioni</p>
<p>Abstract: Negative Prompting (NP) is widely utilized in diffusion models, particularly in text-to-image applications, to prevent the generation of undesired features. In this paper, we show that conventional NP is limited by the assumption of a constant guidance scale, which may lead to highly suboptimal results, or even complete failure, due to the non-stationarity and state-dependence of the reverse process. Based on this analysis, we derive a principled technique called Dynamic Negative Guidance, which relies on a near-optimal time and state dependent modulation of the guidance without requiring additional training. Unlike NP, negative guidance requires estimating the posterior class probability during the denoising process, which is achieved with limited additional computational overhead by tracking the discrete Markov Chain during the generative process. We evaluate the performance of DNG class-removal on MNIST and CIFAR10, where we show that DNG leads to higher safety, preservation of class balance and image quality when compared with baseline methods. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to use DNG with Stable Diffusion to obtain more accurate and less invasive guidance than NP.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14400">Variable Aperture Bokeh Rendering via Customized Focal Plane Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Chen, Shijun Yan, Aiwen Jiang, Han Li, Zhifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bokeh rendering is one of the most popular techniques in photography. It can make photographs visually appealing, forcing users to focus their attentions on particular area of image. However, achieving satisfactory bokeh effect usually presents significant challenge, since mobile cameras with restricted optical systems are constrained, while expensive high-end DSLR lens with large aperture should be needed. Therefore, many deep learning-based computational photography methods have been developed to mimic the bokeh effect in recent years. Nevertheless, most of these methods were limited to rendering bokeh effect in certain single aperture. There lacks user-friendly bokeh rendering method that can provide precise focal plane control and customised bokeh generation. There as well lacks authentic realistic bokeh dataset that can potentially promote bokeh learning on variable apertures. To address these two issues, in this paper, we have proposed an effective controllable bokeh rendering method, and contributed a Variable Aperture Bokeh Dataset (VABD). In the proposed method, user can customize focal plane to accurately locate concerned subjects and select target aperture information for bokeh rendering. Experimental results on public EBB! benchmark dataset and our constructed dataset VABD have demonstrated that the customized focal plane together aperture prompt can bootstrap model to simulate realistic bokeh effect. The proposed method has achieved competitive state-of-the-art performance with only 4.4M parameters, which is much lighter than mainstream computational bokeh models. The contributed dataset and source codes will be released on github https://github.com/MoTong-AI-studio/VABM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling and producing lifelike clothed human images has attracted researchers' attention from different areas for decades, with the complexity from highly articulated and structured content. Rendering algorithms decompose and simulate the imaging process of a camera, while are limited by the accuracy of modeled variables and the efficiency of computation. Generative models can produce impressively vivid human images, however still lacking in controllability and editability. This paper studies photorealism enhancement of rendered images, leveraging generative power from diffusion models on the controlled basis of rendering. We introduce a novel framework to translate rendered images into their realistic counterparts, which consists of two stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic Image Generation (RIG). In DKI, we adopt positive (real) domain finetuning and negative (rendered) domain embedding to inject knowledge into a pretrained Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. In RIG, we generate the realistic image corresponding to the input rendered image, with a Texture-preserving Attention Control (TAC) to preserve fine-grained clothing textures, exploiting the decoupled features encoded in the UNet structure. Additionally, we introduce SynFashion dataset, featuring high-quality digital clothing images with diverse textures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method in rendered-to-real image translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangtao Kong, Kexin Huang, Ping Li, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual brain decoding aims to decode visual information from human brain activities. Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current brain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen subjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals based on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain activities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized to unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first consolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and fMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain decoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a learning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead of employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in previous methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore the generalization capability across different subjects. A series of experiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the network exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of training subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular network architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization performance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal the inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the emerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a brain decoding foundation model in the future.Codes and models can be found at https://github.com/Xiangtaokong/TGBD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Gavrikov, Shashank Agnihotri, Margret Keuper, Janis Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: Not all learnable parameters (e.g., weights) contribute equally to a neural network's decision function. In fact, entire layers' parameters can sometimes be reset to random values with little to no impact on the model's decisions. We revisit earlier studies that examined how architecture and task complexity influence this phenomenon and ask: is this phenomenon also affected by how we train the model? We conducted experimental evaluations on a diverse set of ImageNet-1k classification models to explore this, keeping the architecture and training data constant but varying the training pipeline. Our findings reveal that the training method strongly influences which layers become critical to the decision function for a given task. For example, improved training regimes and self-supervised training increase the importance of early layers while significantly under-utilizing deeper layers. In contrast, methods such as adversarial training display an opposite trend. Our preliminary results extend previous findings, offering a more nuanced understanding of the inner mechanics of neural networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyamin Mehmandar, Reza Talakoob, Charalambos Poullis</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, there are no learning-free or neural techniques for real-time recalibration of infrared multi-camera systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of real-time, highly-accurate calibration of multi-camera infrared systems, a critical task for time-sensitive applications. Unlike traditional calibration techniques that lack adaptability and struggle with on-the-fly recalibrations, we propose a neural network-based method capable of dynamic real-time calibration. The proposed method integrates a differentiable projection model that directly correlates 3D geometries with their 2D image projections and facilitates the direct optimization of both intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Key to our approach is the dynamic camera pose synthesis with perturbations in camera parameters, emulating realistic operational challenges to enhance model robustness. We introduce two model variants: one designed for multi-camera systems with onboard processing of 2D points, utilizing the direct 2D projections of 3D fiducials, and another for image-based systems, employing color-coded projected points for implicitly establishing correspondence. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate our method is more accurate than traditional calibration techniques with or without perturbations while also being real-time, marking a significant leap in the field of real-time multi-camera system calibration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nefeli Andreou, Xi Wang, Victoria Fern\'andez Abrevaya, Marie-Paule Cani, Yiorgos Chrysanthou, Vicky Kalogeiton</p>
<p>Abstract: Our goal is to generate realistic human motion from natural language. Modern methods often face a trade-off between model expressiveness and text-to-motion alignment. Some align text and motion latent spaces but sacrifice expressiveness; others rely on diffusion models producing impressive motions, but lacking semantic meaning in their latent space. This may compromise realism, diversity, and applicability. Here, we address this by combining latent diffusion with a realignment mechanism, producing a novel, semantically structured space that encodes the semantics of language. Leveraging this capability, we introduce the task of textual motion inversion to capture novel motion concepts from a few examples. For motion synthesis, we evaluate LEAD on HumanML3D and KIT-ML and show comparable performance to the state-of-the-art in terms of realism, diversity, and text-motion consistency. Our qualitative analysis and user study reveal that our synthesized motions are sharper, more human-like and comply better with the text compared to modern methods. For motion textual inversion, our method demonstrates improved capacity in capturing out-of-distribution characteristics in comparison to traditional VAEs.</p>

Traditionally, this task has been tackled by processing either audio signals or visual data, or by combining both modalities through fusion or joint learning. In our study, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in visual-language models, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models. The CLIP visual encoder analyzes video segments composed of the upper body of an individual, while the text encoder handles textual descriptions automatically generated through prompt engineering. Subsequently, embeddings from these encoders are fused through a deep neural network to perform VAD. Our experimental analysis across three VAD benchmarks showcases the superior performance of our method compared to existing visual VAD approaches. Notably, our approach outperforms several audio-visual methods despite its simplicity, and without requiring pre-training on extensive audio-visual datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calvin-Khang Ta, Arindam Dutta, Rohit Kundu, Rohit Lal, Hannah Dela Cruz, Dripta S. Raychaudhuri, Amit Roy-Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: The Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model plays a crucial role in 3D human pose estimation, providing a streamlined yet effective representation of the human body. However, ensuring the validity of SMPL configurations during tasks such as human mesh regression remains a significant challenge , highlighting the necessity for a robust human pose prior capable of discerning realistic human poses. To address this, we introduce MOPED: \underline{M}ulti-m\underline{O}dal \underline{P}os\underline{E} \underline{D}iffuser. MOPED is the first method to leverage a novel multi-modal conditional diffusion model as a prior for SMPL pose parameters. Our method offers powerful unconditional pose generation with the ability to condition on multi-modal inputs such as images and text. This capability enhances the applicability of our approach by incorporating additional context often overlooked in traditional pose priors. Extensive experiments across three distinct tasks-pose estimation, pose denoising, and pose completion-demonstrate that our multi-modal diffusion model-based prior significantly outperforms existing methods. These results indicate that our model captures a broader spectrum of plausible human poses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gao Yu Lee, Tanmoy Dam, Md Meftahul Ferdaus, Daniel Puiu Poenar, Vu Duong</p>
<p>Abstract: Image dehazing is crucial for clarifying images obscured by haze or fog, but current learning-based approaches is dependent on large volumes of training data and hence consumed significant computational power. Additionally, their performance is often inadequate under non-uniform or heavy haze. To address these challenges, we developed the Detail Recovery And Contrastive DehazeNet, which facilitates efficient and effective dehazing via a dense dilated inverted residual block and an attention-based detail recovery network that tailors enhancements to specific dehazed scene contexts. A major innovation is its ability to train effectively with limited data, achieved through a novel quadruplet loss-based contrastive dehazing paradigm. This approach distinctly separates hazy and clear image features while also distinguish lower-quality and higher-quality dehazed images obtained from each sub-modules of our network, thereby refining the dehazing process to a larger extent. Extensive tests on a variety of benchmarked haze datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach. The code repository for this work will be available soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-throughput image analysis in the biomedical domain has gained significant attention in recent years, driving advancements in drug discovery, disease prediction, and personalized medicine. Organoids, specifically, are an active area of research, providing excellent models for human organs and their functions. Automating the quantification of organoids in microscopy images would provide an effective solution to overcome substantial manual quantification bottlenecks, particularly in high-throughput image analysis. However, there is a notable lack of open biomedical datasets, in contrast to other domains, such as autonomous driving, and, notably, only few of them have attempted to quantify annotation uncertainty. In this work, we present MultiOrg a comprehensive organoid dataset tailored for object detection tasks with uncertainty quantification. This dataset comprises over 400 high-resolution 2d microscopy images and curated annotations of more than 60,000 organoids. Most importantly, it includes three label sets for the test data, independently annotated by two experts at distinct time points. We additionally provide a benchmark for organoid detection, and make the best model available through an easily installable, interactive plugin for the popular image visualization tool Napari, to perform organoid quantification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Lu, Shengcao Cao, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance on numerous downstream tasks. However, due to their inherent representation biases originating from different training paradigms, VFMs exhibit advantages and disadvantages across distinct vision tasks. Although amalgamating the strengths of multiple VFMs for downstream tasks is an intuitive strategy, effectively exploiting these biases remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and versatile "Swiss Army Knife" (SAK) solution, which adaptively distills knowledge from a committee of VFMs to enhance multi-task learning. Unlike existing methods that use a single backbone for knowledge transfer, our approach preserves the unique representation bias of each teacher by collaborating the lightweight Teacher-Specific Adapter Path modules with the Teacher-Agnostic Stem. Through dynamic selection and combination of representations with Mixture-of-Representations Routers, our SAK is capable of synergizing the complementary strengths of multiple VFMs. Extensive experiments show that our SAK remarkably outperforms prior state of the arts in multi-task learning by 10% on the NYUD-v2 benchmark, while also providing a flexible and robust framework that can readily accommodate more advanced model designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandeep Nagar, Girish Varma</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use Inverse Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse convolution layer resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baiqi Li, Zhiqiu Lin, Wenxuan Peng, Jean de Dieu Nyandwi, Daniel Jiang, Zixian Ma, Simran Khanuja, Ranjay Krishna, Graham Neubig, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complex visio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? In this work, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also find it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a $\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaozhe Hao, Xuantong Liu, Xianbiao Qi, Shihao Zhao, Bojia Zi, Rong Xiao, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce BiGR, a novel conditional image generation model using compact binary latent codes for generative training, focusing on enhancing both generation and representation capabilities. BiGR is the first conditional generative model that unifies generation and discrimination within the same framework. BiGR features a binary tokenizer, a masked modeling mechanism, and a binary transcoder for binary code prediction. Additionally, we introduce a novel entropy-ordered sampling method to enable efficient image generation. Extensive experiments validate BiGR's superior performance in generation quality, as measured by FID-50k, and representation capabilities, as evidenced by linear-probe accuracy. Moreover, BiGR showcases zero-shot generalization across various vision tasks, enabling applications such as image inpainting, outpainting, editing, interpolation, and enrichment, without the need for structural modifications. Our findings suggest that BiGR unifies generative and discriminative tasks effectively, paving the way for further advancements in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> unyang Wu, Fangfang Xie, Jiayuan Sun, Yun Gu, Guang-Zhong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation, which bridges the distributions across different modalities, plays a crucial role in multimodal medical image analysis. In endoscopic imaging, combining pre-operative data with intra-operative imaging is important for surgical planning and navigation. However, existing domain adaptation methods are hampered by distribution shift caused by in vivo artifacts, necessitating robust techniques for aligning noisy and artifact abundant patient endoscopic videos with clean virtual images reconstructed from pre-operative tomographic data for pose estimation during intraoperative guidance. This paper presents an artifact-resilient image translation method and an associated benchmark for this purpose. The method incorporates a novel ``local-global'' translation framework and a noise-resilient feature extraction strategy. For the former, it decouples the image translation process into a local step for feature denoising, and a global step for global style transfer. For feature extraction, a new contrastive learning strategy is proposed, which can extract noise-resilient features for establishing robust correspondence across domains. Detailed validation on both public and in-house clinical datasets has been conducted, demonstrating significantly improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Mulvany, Daniel Griffiths-King, Jan Novak, Heather Rose</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) and Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) brain tumors in pediatric patients is key for assessment of treatment response. Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) guidelines recommend the volumetric measurement of these tumors using MRI. Segmentation challenges, such as the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge, promote development of automated approaches which are replicable, generalizable and accurate, to aid in these tasks. The current study presents a novel adaptation of existing nnU-Net approaches for pediatric brain tumor segmentation, submitted to the BraTS-PEDs 2024 challenge. We apply an adapted nnU-Net with hierarchical cascades to the segmentation task of the BraTS-PEDs 2024 challenge. The residual encoder variant of nnU-Net, used as our baseline model, already provides high quality segmentations. We incorporate multiple changes to the implementation of nnU-Net and devise a novel two-stage cascaded nnU-Net to segment the substructures of brain tumors from coarse to fine. Using outputs from the nnU-Net Residual Encoder (trained to segment CC, ED, ET and NET tumor labels from T1w, T1w-CE, T2w and T2-FLAIR MRI), these are passed to two additional models one classifying ET versus NET and a second classifying CC vs ED using cascade learning. We use radiological guidelines to steer which multi parametric MRI (mpMRI) to use in these cascading models. Compared to a default nnU-Net and an ensembled nnU-net as baseline approaches, our novel method provides robust segmentations for the BraTS-PEDs 2024 challenge, achieving mean Dice scores of 0.657, 0.904, 0.703, and 0.967, and HD95 of 76.2, 10.1, 111.0, and 12.3 for the ET, NET, CC and ED, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding uncertainty plays a critical role in achieving common ground (Clark et al.,1983). This is especially important for multimodal AI systems that collaborate with users to solve a problem or guide the user through a challenging concept. In this work, for the first time, we present a dataset annotated in collaboration with developmental and cognitive psychologists for the purpose of studying nonverbal cues of uncertainty. We then present an analysis of the data, studying different roles of uncertainty and its relationship with task difficulty and performance. Lastly, we present a multimodal machine learning model that can predict uncertainty given a real-time video clip of a participant, which we find improves upon a baseline multimodal transformer model. This work informs research on cognitive coordination between human-human and human-AI and has broad implications for gesture understanding and generation. The anonymized version of our data and code will be publicly available upon the completion of the required consent forms and data sheets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hariprasath Govindarajan, Per Sid\'en, Jacob Roll, Fredrik Lindsten</p>
<p>Abstract: A prominent self-supervised learning paradigm is to model the representations as clusters, or more generally as a mixture model. Learning to map the data samples to compact representations and fitting the mixture model simultaneously leads to the representation collapse problem. Regularizing the distribution of data points over the clusters is the prevalent strategy to avoid this issue. While this is sufficient to prevent full representation collapse, we show that a partial prototype collapse problem still exists in the DINO family of methods, that leads to significant redundancies in the prototypes. Such prototype redundancies serve as shortcuts for the method to achieve a marginal latent class distribution that matches the prescribed prior. We show that by encouraging the model to use diverse prototypes, the partial prototype collapse can be mitigated. Effective utilization of the prototypes enables the methods to learn more fine-grained clusters, encouraging more informative representations. We demonstrate that this is especially beneficial when pre-training on a long-tailed fine-grained dataset.</p>

  In order to solve these problems we propose a simpler self-supervised robotic setup, that will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The robot will label and collect the data during the training process. The idea is to make a robot that is less costly, small and easily maintainable in a lab setup. The robot will be trained on a large data set for several hundred hours and then the trained Neural Network can be mapped onto a larger grasping robot.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of learning end to end perception to control for ground vehicles solely from aerial imagery. Photogrammetric simulators allow the synthesis of novel views through the transformation of pre-generated assets into novel views.However, they have a large setup cost, require careful collection of data and often human effort to create usable simulators. We use a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as an intermediate representation to synthesize novel views from the point of view of a ground vehicle. These novel viewpoints can then be used for several downstream autonomous navigation applications. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of novel view synthesis though the application of training a policy for end to end learning from images and depth data. In a traditional real to sim to real framework, the collected data would be transformed into a visual simulator which could then be used to generate novel views. In contrast, using a NeRF allows a compact representation and the ability to optimize over the parameters of the visual simulator as more data is gathered in the environment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a custom built mini-city environment through the deployment of imitation policies on robotic cars. We additionally consider the task of place localization and demonstrate that our method is able to relocalize the car in the real world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities across various tasks, including visual question answering and chart comprehension, yet existing benchmarks for chart-related tasks fall short in capturing the complexity of real-world multi-chart scenarios. Current benchmarks primarily focus on single-chart tasks, neglecting the multi-hop reasoning required to extract and integrate information from multiple charts, which is essential in practical applications. To fill this gap, we introduce MultiChartQA, a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' capabilities in four key areas: direct question answering, parallel question answering, comparative reasoning, and sequential reasoning. Our evaluation of a wide range of MLLMs reveals significant performance gaps compared to humans. These results highlight the challenges in multi-chart comprehension and the potential of MultiChartQA to drive advancements in this field.

<p>Abstract: The development of 3D medical vision-language models holds significant potential for disease diagnosis and patient treatment. However, compared to 2D medical images, 3D medical images, such as CT scans, face challenges related to limited training data and high dimension, which severely restrict the progress of 3D medical vision-language models. To address these issues, we collect a large amount of unlabeled 3D CT data and utilize self-supervised learning to construct a 3D visual foundation model for extracting 3D visual features. Then, we apply 3D spatial convolutions to aggregate and project high-level image features, reducing computational complexity while preserving spatial information. We also construct two instruction-tuning datasets based on BIMCV-R and CT-RATE to fine-tune the 3D vision-language model. Our model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in report generation, visual question answering, and disease diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Yamani, Malak Baslyman</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image generative systems are progressing rapidly to be a source of advertisement and media and could soon serve as image searches or artists. However, there is a significant concern about the representativity bias these models embody and how these biases can propagate in the social fabric after fine-tuning them. Therefore, continuously monitoring and evaluating these models for fairness is important. To address this issue, we propose Text-to-Image (TTI) Representativity Fairness Evaluation Framework. In this framework, we evaluate three aspects of a TTI system; diversity, inclusion, and quality. For each aspect, human-based and model-based approaches are proposed and evaluated for their ability to capture the bias and whether they can substitute each other. The framework starts by suggesting the prompts for generating the images for the evaluation based on the context and the sensitive attributes under study. Then the three aspects are evaluated using the proposed approaches. Based on the evaluation, a decision is made regarding the representativity bias within the TTI system. The evaluation of our framework on Stable Diffusion shows that the framework can effectively capture the bias in TTI systems. The results also confirm that our proposed model based-approaches can substitute human-based approaches in three out of four components with high correlation, which could potentially reduce costs and automate the process. The study suggests that continual learning of the model on more inclusive data across disadvantaged minorities such as Indians and Middle Easterners is essential to mitigate current stereotyping and lack of inclusiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Nielsen</p>
<p>Abstract: The symmetric Kullback-Leibler centroid also called the Jeffreys centroid of a set of mutually absolutely continuous probability distributions on a measure space provides a notion of centrality which has proven useful in many tasks including information retrieval, information fusion, and clustering in image, video and sound processing. However, the Jeffreys centroid is not available in closed-form for sets of categorical or normal distributions, two widely used statistical models, and thus need to be approximated numerically in practice. In this paper, we first propose the new Jeffreys-Fisher-Rao center defined as the Fisher-Rao midpoint of the sided Kullback-Leibler centroids as a plug-in replacement of the Jeffreys centroid. This Jeffreys-Fisher-Rao center admits a generic formula for uni-parameter exponential family distributions, and closed-form formula for categorical and normal distributions, matches exactly the Jeffreys centroid for same-mean normal distributions, and is experimentally observed in practice to be close to the Jeffreys centroid. Second, we define a new type of inductive centers generalizing the principle of Gauss arithmetic-geometric double sequence mean for pairs of densities of any given exponential family. This center is shown experimentally to approximate very well the Jeffreys centroid and is suggested to use when the Jeffreys-Fisher-Rao center is not available in closed form. Moreover, this Gauss-Bregman inductive center always converges and matches the Jeffreys centroid for sets of same-mean normal distributions. We report on our experiments demonstrating the use of the Jeffreys-Fisher-Rao and Gauss-Bregman centers instead of the Jeffreys centroid. Finally, we conclude this work by reinterpreting these fast proxy centers of Jeffreys centroids under the lens of dually flat spaces in information geometry.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent developments in the registration of histology and micro-computed tomography ({\mu}CT) have broadened the perspective of pathological applications such as virtual histology based on {\mu}CT. This topic remains challenging because of the low image quality of soft tissue CT. Additionally, soft tissue samples usually deform during the histology slide preparation, making it difficult to correlate the structures between histology slide and {\mu}CT. In this work, we propose a novel 2D-3D multi-modal deformable image registration method. The method uses a machine learning (ML) based initialization followed by the registration. The registration is finalized by an analytical out-of-plane deformation refinement. The method is evaluated on datasets acquired from tonsil and tumor tissues. {\mu}CTs of both phase-contrast and conventional absorption modalities are investigated. The registration results from the proposed method are compared with those from intensity- and keypoint-based methods. The comparison is conducted using both visual and fiducial-based evaluations. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to the other two methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enneng Yang, Li Shen, Zhenyi Wang, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang, Xiaocun Cao, Jie Zhang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging-based multitask learning (MTL) offers a promising approach for performing MTL by merging multiple expert models without requiring access to raw training data. However, in this paper, we examine the merged model's representation distribution and uncover a critical issue of "representation bias". This bias arises from a significant distribution gap between the representations of the merged and expert models, leading to the suboptimal performance of the merged MTL model. To address this challenge, we first propose a representation surgery solution called Surgery. Surgery is a lightweight, task-specific module that aligns the final layer representations of the merged model with those of the expert models, effectively alleviating bias and improving the merged model's performance. Despite these improvements, a performance gap remains compared to the traditional MTL method. Further analysis reveals that representation bias phenomena exist at each layer of the merged model, and aligning representations only in the last layer is insufficient for fully reducing systemic bias because biases introduced at each layer can accumulate and interact in complex ways. To tackle this, we then propose a more comprehensive solution, deep representation surgery (also called SurgeryV2), which mitigates representation bias across all layers, and thus bridges the performance gap between model merging-based MTL and traditional MTL. Finally, we design an unsupervised optimization objective to optimize both the Surgery and SurgeryV2 modules. Our experimental results show that incorporating these modules into state-of-the-art (SOTA) model merging schemes leads to significant performance gains. Notably, our SurgeryV2 scheme reaches almost the same level as individual expert models or the traditional MTL model. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/SurgeryV2}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cynthia Maldonado-Garcia, Arezoo Zakeri, Alejandro F Frangi, Nishant Ravikumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Early identification of patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is crucial for effective preventive care, reducing healthcare burden, and improving patients' quality of life. This study demonstrates the potential of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging combined with fundus photographs for identifying future adverse cardiac events. We used data from 977 patients who experienced CVD within a 5-year interval post-image acquisition, alongside 1,877 control participants without CVD, totaling 2,854 subjects. We propose a novel binary classification network based on a Multi-channel Variational Autoencoder (MCVAE), which learns a latent embedding of patients' fundus and OCT images to classify individuals into two groups: those likely to develop CVD in the future and those who are not. Our model, trained on both imaging modalities, achieved promising results (AUROC 0.78 +/- 0.02, accuracy 0.68 +/- 0.002, precision 0.74 +/- 0.02, sensitivity 0.73 +/- 0.02, and specificity 0.68 +/- 0.01), demonstrating its efficacy in identifying patients at risk of future CVD events based on their retinal images. This study highlights the potential of retinal OCT imaging and fundus photographs as cost-effective, non-invasive alternatives for predicting cardiovascular disease risk. The widespread availability of these imaging techniques in optometry practices and hospitals further enhances their potential for large-scale CVD risk screening. Our findings contribute to the development of standardized, accessible methods for early CVD risk identification, potentially improving preventive care strategies and patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Skin cancer is a serious and potentially fatal disease caused by DNA damage. Early detection significantly increases survival rates, making accurate diagnosis crucial. In this groundbreaking study, we present a hybrid framework based on Deep Learning (DL) that achieves precise classification of benign and malignant skin lesions. Our approach begins with dataset preprocessing to enhance classification accuracy, followed by training two separate pre-trained DL models, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121. By fusing the results of each model using the weighted sum rule, our system achieves exceptional accuracy rates. Specifically, we achieve a 92.27% detection accuracy rate, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.22% specificity, 90.81% precision, and 91.57% F1-score, outperforming existing models and demonstrating the robustness and trustworthiness of our hybrid approach. Our study represents a significant advance in skin cancer diagnosis and provides a promising foundation for further research in the field. With the potential to save countless lives through earlier detection, our hybrid deep-learning approach is a game-changer in the fight against skin cancer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Wolf, Tristan Payer, Catharina Silvia Lisson, Christoph Gerhard Lisson, Meinrad Beer, Michael G\"otz, Timo Ropinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training of deep learning models with contrastive learning is a widely used technique in image analysis. Current findings indicate a strong potential for contrastive pre-training on medical images. However, further research is necessary to incorporate the particular characteristics of these images. We hypothesize that the similarity of medical images hinders the success of contrastive learning in the medical imaging domain. To this end, we investigate different strategies based on deep embedding, information theory, and hashing in order to identify and reduce redundancy in medical pre-training datasets. The effect of these different reduction strategies on contrastive learning is evaluated on two pre-training datasets and several downstream classification tasks. In all of our experiments, dataset reduction leads to a considerable performance gain in downstream tasks, e.g., an AUC score improvement from 0.78 to 0.83 for the COVID CT Classification Grand Challenge, 0.97 to 0.98 for the OrganSMNIST Classification Challenge and 0.73 to 0.83 for a brain hemorrhage classification task. Furthermore, pre-training is up to nine times faster due to the dataset reduction. In conclusion, the proposed approach highlights the importance of dataset quality and provides a transferable approach to improve contrastive pre-training for classification downstream tasks on medical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksuda Akter, Rabea Khatun, Md Manowarul Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most malignant form of leukemia and the most common cancer in adults and children. Traditionally, leukemia is diagnosed by analyzing blood and bone marrow smears under a microscope, with additional cytochemical tests for confirmation. However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and highly dependent on expert knowledge. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has provided advanced methods for classifying microscopic smear images, aiding in the detection of leukemic cells. These approaches are quick, cost effective, and not subject to human bias. However, most methods lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, which could lead to critical misdiagnoses. In this research, hybrid deep learning models (InceptionV3-GRU, EfficientNetB3-GRU, MobileNetV2-GRU) were implemented to classify ALL. Bayesian optimization was used to fine tune the model's hyperparameters and improve its performance. Additionally, Deep Ensemble uncertainty quantification was applied to address uncertainty during leukemia image classification. The proposed models were trained on the publicly available datasets ALL-IDB1 and ALL-IDB2. Their results were then aggregated at the score level using the sum rule. The parallel architecture used in these models offers a high level of confidence in differentiating between ALL and non-ALL cases. The proposed method achieved a remarkable detection accuracy rate of 100% on the ALL-IDB1 dataset, 98.07% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset, and 98.64% on the combined dataset, demonstrating its potential for accurate and reliable leukemia diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel S. Y. Teo, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become the key to unlocking unparalleled scalability in deep learning. SMoE has the potential to exponentially increase parameter count while maintaining the efficiency of the model by only activating a small subset of these parameters for a given sample. However, it has been observed that SMoE suffers from unstable training and has difficulty adapting to new distributions, leading to the model's lack of robustness to data contamination. To overcome these limitations, we first establish a connection between the dynamics of the expert representations in SMoEs and gradient descent on a multi-objective optimization problem. Leveraging our framework, we then integrate momentum into SMoE and propose a new family of SMoEs named MomentumSMoE. We theoretically prove and numerically demonstrate that MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE. In particular, we verify the advantages of MomentumSMoE over SMoE on a variety of practical tasks including ImageNet-1K object recognition and WikiText-103 language modeling. We demonstrate the applicability of MomentumSMoE to many types of SMoE models, including those in the Sparse MoE model for vision (V-MoE) and the Generalist Language Model (GLaM). We also show that other advanced momentum-based optimization methods, such as Adam, can be easily incorporated into the MomentumSMoE framework for designing new SMoE models with even better performance, almost negligible additional computation cost, and simple implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglai Li, Chang Tang, Xinwang Liu, Xingchen Hu, Xianju Li, Ning Li, Changdong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection (CD) is essential for various real-world applications, such as urban management and disaster assessment. Numerous CD methods have been proposed, and considerable results have been achieved recently. However, detecting changes in hard regions, i.e., the change boundary and irrelevant pseudo changes caused by background clutters, remains difficult for these methods, since they pose equal attention for all regions in bi-temporal images. This paper proposes a novel change detection network, termed as HRANet, which provides accurate change maps via hard region mining. Specifically, an online hard region estimation branch is constructed to model the pixel-wise hard samples, supervised by the error between predicted change maps and corresponding ground truth during the training process. A cross-layer knowledge review module is introduced to distill temporal change information from low-level to high-level features, thereby enhancing the feature representation capabilities. Finally, the hard region aware features extracted from the online hard region estimation branch and multi-level temporal difference features are aggregated into a unified feature representation to improve the accuracy of CD. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HRANet in the CD task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiao Shen, John Dudley, Per Ola Kristensson</p>
<p>Abstract: We depend on our own memory to encode, store, and retrieve our experiences. However, memory lapses can occur. One promising avenue for achieving memory augmentation is through the use of augmented reality head-mounted displays to capture and preserve egocentric videos, a practice commonly referred to as lifelogging. However, a significant challenge arises from the sheer volume of video data generated through lifelogging, as the current technology lacks the capability to encode and store such large amounts of data efficiently. Further, retrieving specific information from extensive video archives requires substantial computational power, further complicating the task of quickly accessing desired content. To address these challenges, we propose a memory augmentation agent that involves leveraging natural language encoding for video data and storing them in a vector database. This approach harnesses the power of large vision language models to perform the language encoding process. Additionally, we propose using large language models to facilitate natural language querying. Our agent underwent extensive evaluation using the QA-Ego4D dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results with a BLEU score of 8.3, outperforming conventional machine learning models that scored between 3.4 and 5.8. Additionally, we conducted a user study in which participants interacted with the human memory augmentation agent through episodic memory and open-ended questions. The results of this study show that the agent results in significantly better recall performance on episodic memory tasks compared to human participants. The results also highlight the agent's practical applicability and user acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangxian Xie, Jiancheng Yang, Donglai Wei, Ziqiao Weng, Pascal Fua</p>
<p>Abstract: Pulmonary diseases rank prominently among the principal causes of death worldwide. Curing them will require, among other things, a better understanding of the complex 3D tree-shaped structures within the pulmonary system, such as airways, arteries, and veins. Traditional approaches using high-resolution image stacks and standard CNNs on dense voxel grids face challenges in computational efficiency, limited resolution, local context, and inadequate preservation of shape topology. Our method addresses these issues by shifting from dense voxel to sparse point representation, offering better memory efficiency and global context utilization. However, the inherent sparsity in point representation can lead to a loss of crucial connectivity in tree-shaped structures. To mitigate this, we introduce graph learning on skeletonized structures, incorporating differentiable feature fusion for improved topology and long-distance context capture. Furthermore, we employ an implicit function for efficient conversion of sparse representations into dense reconstructions end-to-end. The proposed method not only delivers state-of-the-art performance in labeling accuracy, both overall and at key locations, but also enables efficient inference and the generation of closed surface shapes. Addressing data scarcity in this field, we have also curated a comprehensive dataset to validate our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Assaf Ben-Kish, Moran Yanuka, Morris Alper, Raja Giryes, Hadar Averbuch-Elor</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent years have seen rapid progress in image-conditioned text generation, image captioning still suffers from the fundamental issue of hallucinations, namely, the generation of spurious details that cannot be inferred from the given image. Existing methods largely use closed-vocabulary object lists to mitigate or evaluate hallucinations in image captioning, ignoring the long-tailed nature of hallucinations that occur in practice. To this end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image captioning in the open-vocabulary setting. Our framework includes a new benchmark, OpenCHAIR, that leverages generative foundation models to evaluate open-vocabulary object hallucinations for image captioning, surpassing the popular and similarly-sized CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy. Furthermore, to mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations without using a closed object list, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in reinforcement learning. Our multi-objective reward function explicitly targets the trade-off between fidelity and adequacy in generations without requiring any strong supervision. MOCHa improves a large variety of image captioning models, as captured by our OpenCHAIR benchmark and other existing metrics.

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is vital to the success of super-resolution of depth maps. However, commonly used fusion strategies, such as addition and concatenation, fall short of effectively bridging the modal gap. As a result, guided image filtering methods have been introduced to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, it is observed that their filter kernels usually encounter significant texture interference and edge inaccuracy. To tackle these two challenges, we introduce a Scene Prior Filtering network, SPFNet, which utilizes the priors surface normal and semantic map from large-scale models. Specifically, we design an All-in-one Prior Propagation that computes the similarity between multi-modal scene priors, i.e., RGB, normal, semantic, and depth, to reduce the texture interference. In addition, we present a One-to-one Prior Embedding that continuously embeds each single-modal prior into depth using Mutual Guided Filtering, further alleviating the texture interference while enhancing edges. Our SPFNet has been extensively evaluated on both real and synthetic datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural network quantization is a critical technique for deploying models on resource-limited devices. Despite its widespread use, the impact of quantization on model perceptual fields, particularly in relation to class activation maps (CAMs), remains underexplored. This study investigates how quantization influences the spatial recognition abilities of vision models by examining the alignment between CAMs and visual salient objects maps across various architectures. Utilizing a dataset of 10,000 images from ImageNet, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of six diverse CNN architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet. Through the systematic application of quantization techniques, we identify subtle changes in CAMs and their alignment with Salient object maps. Our results demonstrate the differing sensitivities of these architectures to quantization and highlight its implications for model performance and interpretability in real-world applications. This work primarily contributes to a deeper understanding of neural network quantization, offering insights essential for deploying efficient and interpretable models in practical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimating the pose of objects from images is a crucial task of 3D scene understanding, and recent approaches have shown promising results on very large benchmarks. However, these methods experience a significant performance drop when dealing with unseen objects. We believe that it results from the limited generalizability of image features. To address this problem, we have an in-depth analysis on the features of diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion, which hold substantial potential for modeling unseen objects. Based on this analysis, we then innovatively introduce these diffusion features for object pose estimation. To achieve this, we propose three distinct architectures that can effectively capture and aggregate diffusion features of different granularity, greatly improving the generalizability of object pose estimation. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin on three popular benchmark datasets, LM, O-LM, and T-LESS. In particular, our method achieves higher accuracy than the previous best arts on unseen objects: 97.9% vs. 93.5% on Unseen LM, 85.9% vs. 76.3% on Unseen O-LM, showing the strong generalizability of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naichuan Zheng, Hailun Xia, Zeyu Liang, Yuanyuan Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, skeleton-based action recognition, leveraging multimodal Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), has achieved remarkable results. However, due to their deep structure and reliance on continuous floating-point operations, GCN-based methods are energy-intensive. We propose an innovative Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation (MK-SGN) to address this issue. By merging the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with the graph representation capability of GCN, the proposed MK-SGN reduces energy consumption while maintaining recognition accuracy. Firstly, we convert Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) into Spiking Graph Convolutional Networks (SGN) establishing a new benchmark and paving the way for future research exploration. During this process, we introduce a spiking attention mechanism and design a Spiking-Spatio Graph Convolution module with a Spatial Global Spiking Attention mechanism (SA-SGC), enhancing feature learning capability. Secondly, we propose a Spiking Multimodal Fusion module (SMF), leveraging mutual information to process multimodal data more efficiently. Lastly, we delve into knowledge distillation methods from multimodal GCN to SGN and propose a novel, integrated method that simultaneously focuses on both intermediate layer distillation and soft label distillation to improve the performance of SGN. MK-SGN outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-like frameworks on three challenging datasets for skeleton-based action recognition in reducing energy consumption. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in accuracy. Specifically, our method reduces energy consumption by more than 98% compared to typical GCN-based methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy on the NTU-RGB+D 60 cross-subject split using 4-time steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luxi Chen, Zhengyi Wang, Zihan Zhou, Tingting Gao, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Chongxuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization-based approaches, such as score distillation sampling (SDS), show promise in zero-shot 3D generation but suffer from low efficiency, primarily due to the high number of function evaluations (NFEs) required for each sample and the limitation of optimization confined to latent space. This paper introduces score-based iterative reconstruction (SIR), an efficient and general algorithm mimicking a differentiable 3D reconstruction process to reduce the NFEs and enable optimization in pixel space. Given a single set of images sampled from a multi-view score-based diffusion model, SIR repeatedly optimizes 3D parameters, unlike the single-step optimization in SDS. With other improvements in training, we present an efficient approach called MicroDreamer that generally applies to various 3D representations and 3D generation tasks. In particular, MicroDreamer is 5-20 times faster than SDS in generating neural radiance field while retaining a comparable performance and takes about 20 seconds to create meshes from 3D Gaussian splatting on a single A100 GPU, halving the time of the fastest optimization-based baseline DreamGaussian with significantly superior performance compared to the measurement standard deviation.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have significantly impacted various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks. One area that stands to benefit greatly is Earth observation, where these models can efficiently process large-scale, unlabeled geospatial data. In this work we extend the SwinMAE model to integrate temporal information for satellite time-series data. The architecture employs a hierarchical 3D Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks to effectively capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies in satellite imagery. To enhance transfer learning, we incorporate both encoder and decoder pretrained weights, along with skip connections to preserve scale-specific information. This forms an architecture similar to SwinUNet with an additional temporal component. Our approach shows significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art foundation models for all the evaluated downstream tasks: land cover segmentation, building density prediction, flood mapping, wildfire scar mapping and multi-temporal crop segmentation. Particularly, in the land cover segmentation task of the PhilEO Bench dataset, it outperforms other geospatial foundation models with a 10.4% higher accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trong-Thuan Nguyen, Pha Nguyen, Xin Li, Jackson Cothren, Alper Yilmaz, Khoa Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video scene graph generation (VidSGG) has emerged as a transformative approach to capturing and interpreting the intricate relationships among objects and their temporal dynamics in video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the new AeroEye dataset that focuses on multi-object relationship modeling in aerial videos. Our AeroEye dataset features various drone scenes and includes a visually comprehensive and precise collection of predicates that capture the intricate relationships and spatial arrangements among objects. To this end, we propose the novel Cyclic Graph Transformer (CYCLO) approach that allows the model to capture both direct and long-range temporal dependencies by continuously updating the history of interactions in a circular manner. The proposed approach also allows one to handle sequences with inherent cyclical patterns and process object relationships in the correct sequential order. Therefore, it can effectively capture periodic and overlapping relationships while minimizing information loss. The extensive experiments on the AeroEye dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CYCLO model, demonstrating its potential to perform scene understanding on drone videos. Finally, the CYCLO method consistently achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on two in-the-wild scene graph generation benchmarks, i.e., PVSG and ASPIRe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Jena, Pratik Chaudhari, James C. Gee</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning in Image Registration (DLIR) methods have been tremendously successful in image registration due to their speed and ability to incorporate weak label supervision at training time. However, DLIR methods forego many of the benefits of classical optimization-based methods. The functional nature of deep networks do not guarantee that the predicted transformation is a local minima of the registration objective, the representation of the transformation (displacement/velocity field/affine) is fixed, and the networks are not robust to domain shift. Our method aims to bridge this gap between classical and learning methods by incorporating optimization as a layer in a deep network. A deep network is trained to predict multi-scale dense feature images that are registered using a black box iterative optimization solver. This optimal warp is then used to minimize image and label alignment errors. By implicitly differentiating end-to-end through an iterative optimization solver, our learned features are registration and label-aware, and the warp functions are guaranteed to be local minima of the registration objective in the feature space. Our framework shows excellent performance on in-domain datasets, and is agnostic to domain shift such as anisotropy and varying intensity profiles. For the first time, our method allows switching between arbitrary transformation representations (free-form to diffeomorphic) at test time with zero retraining. End-to-end feature learning also facilitates interpretability of features, and out-of-the-box promptability using additional label-fidelity terms at inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Yuan, Hanling Zhang, Pu Lu, Xuefei Ning, Linfeng Zhang, Tianchen Zhao, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) excel at image and video generation but face computational challenges due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention operators. We propose DiTFastAttn, a post-training compression method to alleviate the computational bottleneck of DiT. We identify three key redundancies in the attention computation during DiT inference: (1) spatial redundancy, where many attention heads focus on local information; (2) temporal redundancy, with high similarity between the attention outputs of neighboring steps; (3) conditional redundancy, where conditional and unconditional inferences exhibit significant similarity. We propose three techniques to reduce these redundancies: (1) Window Attention with Residual Sharing to reduce spatial redundancy; (2) Attention Sharing across Timesteps to exploit the similarity between steps; (3) Attention Sharing across CFG to skip redundant computations during conditional generation. We apply DiTFastAttn to DiT, PixArt-Sigma for image generation tasks, and OpenSora for video generation tasks. Our results show that for image generation, our method reduces up to 76% of the attention FLOPs and achieves up to 1.8x end-to-end speedup at high-resolution (2k x 2k) generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Basim Azam, Naveed Akhtar</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) introduce a paradigm of neural modeling that implements learnable functions on the edges of the networks, diverging from the traditional node-centric activations in neural networks. This work assesses the applicability and efficacy of KANs in visual modeling, focusing on fundamental recognition and segmentation tasks. We mainly analyze the performance and efficiency of different network architectures built using KAN concepts along with conventional building blocks of convolutional and linear layers, enabling a comparative analysis with the conventional models. Our findings are aimed at contributing to understanding the potential of KANs in computer vision, highlighting both their strengths and areas for further research. Our evaluation point toward the fact that while KAN-based architectures perform in line with the original claims, it may often be important to employ more complex functions on the network edges to retain the performance advantage of KANs on more complex visual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han-Hung Lee, Yiming Zhang, Angel X. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Duoduo CLIP, a model for 3D representation learning that learns shape encodings from multi-view images instead of point-clouds. The choice of multi-view images allows us to leverage 2D priors from off-the-shelf CLIP models to facilitate fine-tuning with 3D data. Our approach not only shows better generalization compared to existing point cloud methods, but also reduces GPU requirements and training time. In addition, the model is modified with cross-view attention to leverage information across multiple frames of the object which further boosts performance. Notably, our model is permutation invariant to the order of multi-view images while being pose-free. Compared to the current SOTA point cloud method that requires 480 A100 hours to train 1 billion model parameters we only require 57 A5000 hours and 87 million parameters. Multi-view images also provide more flexibility including being able to encode objects with a variable number of images, and performance scales when more views are used. In contrast, point cloud based methods require an entire scan or model of the object. We showcase this flexibility with benchmarks from images of real-world objects. Our model also achieves better performance in more fine-grained text to shape retrieval, demonstrating better text-and-shape alignment than point cloud based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoxiao Chen, Junjie Meng, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh, Yonggang Zhang, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is crucial for various applications but often experiences performance degradation in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging cross-corruption scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation. The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Xu, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Language models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs with additional visual modality are also exhibited with similar ICL abilities when multiple image-text pairs are provided as demonstrations. However, relatively less work has been done to investigate the principles behind how and why multimodal ICL works. We conduct a systematic and principled evaluation of multimodal ICL for models of different scales on a broad spectrum of new yet critical tasks. Through perturbations over different modality information, we show that modalities matter differently across tasks in multimodal ICL. Guided by task-specific modality impact, we recommend modality-driven demonstration strategies to boost ICL performance. We also find that models may follow inductive biases from multimodal ICL even if they are rarely seen in or contradict semantic priors from pretraining data. Our principled analysis provides a comprehensive way of understanding the role of demonstrations in multimodal in-context learning, and sheds light on effectively improving multimodal ICL on a wide range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqiang Zu, Shenghao Xie, Qing Zhao, Guoqi Li, Lei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale data have been widely witnessed to achieve success in various natural imaging downstream tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator. And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaodong Sun, Xiaobai Li, Jukka Komulainen, Guoying Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naichuan Zheng, Hailun Xia, Dapeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In skeletal-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) based methods face limitations due to their complexity and high energy consumption. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained attention in recent years for their low energy consumption, but existing methods combining GCNs and SNNs fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of skeletal sequences, leading to increased storage and computational costs. To address this issue, we propose a Signal-SGN(Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which leverages the temporal dimension of skeletal sequences as the spiking timestep and treats features as discrete stochastic signals. The core of the network consists of a 1D Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (1D-SGN) and a Frequency Spiking Convolutional Network (FSN). The SGN performs graph convolution on single frames and incorporates spiking network characteristics to capture inter-frame temporal relationships, while the FSN uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and complex convolution to extract temporal-frequency features. We also introduce a multi-scale wavelet transform feature fusion module(MWTF) to capture spectral features of temporal signals, enhancing the model's classification capability. We propose a pluggable temporal-frequency spatial semantic feature extraction module(TFSM) to enhance the model's ability to distinguish features without increasing inference-phase consumption. Our numerous experiments on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate that the proposed models not only surpass existing SNN-based methods in accuracy but also reduce computational and storage costs during training. Furthermore, they achieve competitive accuracy compared to corresponding GCN-based methods, which is quite remarkable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naser Kazemi, Nedko Savov, Danda Paudel, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: World models are increasingly pivotal in interpreting and simulating the rules and actions of complex environments. Genie, a recent model, excels at learning from visually diverse environments but relies on costly human-collected data. We observe that their alternative method of using random agents is too limited to explore the environment. We propose to improve the model by employing reinforcement learning based agents for data generation. This approach produces diverse datasets that enhance the model's ability to adapt and perform well across various scenarios and realistic actions within the environment. In this paper, we first release the model GenieRedux - an implementation based on Genie. Additionally, we introduce GenieRedux-G, a variant that uses the agent's readily available actions to factor out action prediction uncertainty during validation. Our evaluation, including a replication of the Coinrun case study, shows that GenieRedux-G achieves superior visual fidelity and controllability using the trained agent exploration. The proposed approach is reproducable, scalable and adaptable to new types of environments. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/insait-institute/GenieRedux .</p>

<p>Abstract: Nighttime camera-based depth estimation is a highly challenging task, especially for autonomous driving applications, where accurate depth perception is essential for ensuring safe navigation. We aim to improve the reliability of perception systems at night time, where models trained on daytime data often fail in the absence of precise but costly LiDAR sensors. In this work, we introduce Light Enhanced Depth (LED), a novel cost-effective approach that significantly improves depth estimation in low-light environments by harnessing a pattern projected by high definition headlights available in modern vehicles. LED leads to significant performance boosts across multiple depth-estimation architectures (encoder-decoder, Adabins, DepthFormer) both on synthetic and real datasets. Furthermore, increased performances beyond illuminated areas reveal a holistic enhancement in scene understanding. Finally, we release the Nighttime Synthetic Drive Dataset, a new synthetic and photo-realistic nighttime dataset, which comprises 49,990 comprehensively annotated images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Shu, Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Minghao Qin, Junjie Zhou, Tiejun Huang, Bo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Although current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising results in video understanding, processing extremely long videos remains an ongoing challenge. Typically, MLLMs struggle with handling thousands of visual tokens that exceed the maximum context length, and they suffer from the information decay due to token aggregation. Another challenge is the high computational cost stemming from the large number of video tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose Video-XL, an extra-long vision language model designed for efficient hour-scale video understanding. Specifically, we argue that LLMs can be adapted as effective visual condensers and propose Visual Context Latent Summarization which condenses visual contexts into highly compact forms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising results on popular long video understanding benchmarks. For example, Video-XL outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on VNBench by nearly 10\% in accuracy. Moreover, Video-XL presents an impressive balance between efficiency and effectiveness, processing 2048 frames on a single 80GB GPU while achieving nearly 95% accuracy in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Kumar, Raghav Singhal, Pranamya Kulkarni, Deval Mehta, Kshitij Jadhav</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveraging contrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations across modalities. However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-label multi-view action recognition aims to recognize multiple concurrent or sequential actions from untrimmed videos captured by multiple cameras. Existing work has focused on multi-view action recognition in a narrow area with strong labels available, where the onset and offset of each action are labeled at the frame-level. This study focuses on real-world scenarios where cameras are distributed to capture a wide-range area with only weak labels available at the video-level. We propose the method named Multi-view Action Selection Learning (MultiASL), which leverages action selection learning to enhance view fusion by selecting the most useful information from different viewpoints. The proposed method includes a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal Transformer video encoder to extract spatial and temporal features from multi-viewpoint videos. Action Selection Learning is employed at the frame-level, using pseudo ground-truth obtained from weak labels at the video-level, to identify the most relevant frames for action recognition. Experiments in a real-world office environment using the MM-Office dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

To achieve this, our key insight is in representation: we propose spatial and temporal invariance criteria for improving model performance, from which we derive a head motion conditioning parameterization that improves estimation by up to 18%. We also show how the bodies estimated by our system can improve the hands: the resulting kinematic and temporal constraints result in over 40% lower hand estimation errors compared to noisy monocular estimates.

<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal predictive learning methods generally fall into two categories: recurrent-based approaches, which face challenges in parallelization and performance, and recurrent-free methods, which employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as encoder-decoder architectures. These methods benefit from strong inductive biases but often at the expense of scalability and generalization. This paper proposes PredFormer, a pure transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal predictive learning. Motivated by the Vision Transformers (ViT) design, PredFormer leverages carefully designed Gated Transformer blocks, following a comprehensive analysis of 3D attention mechanisms, including full-, factorized-, and interleaved-spatial-temporal attention. With its recurrent-free, transformer-based design, PredFormer is both simple and efficient, significantly outperforming previous methods by large margins. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PredFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. On Moving MNIST, PredFormer achieves a 51.3% reduction in MSE relative to SimVP. For TaxiBJ, the model decreases MSE by 33.1% and boosts FPS from 533 to 2364. Additionally, on WeatherBench, it reduces MSE by 11.1% while enhancing FPS from 196 to 404. These performance gains in both accuracy and efficiency demonstrate PredFormer's potential for real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaorui Sun, Jun Liu, Heng Tao Shen, Xiaofeng Zhu, Ping Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational model for image segmentation tasks, known for its strong generalization across diverse applications. However, its impressive performance comes with significant computational and resource demands, making it challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments such as edge devices. To address this, a variety of SAM variants have been proposed to enhance efficiency while keeping accuracy. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of these efficient SAM variants. We begin by exploring the motivations driving this research. We then present core techniques used in SAM and model acceleration. This is followed by a detailed exploration of SAM acceleration strategies, categorized by approach, and a discussion of several future research directions. Finally, we offer a unified and extensive evaluation of these methods across various hardware, assessing their efficiency and accuracy on representative benchmarks, and providing a clear comparison of their overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyi Pan, Wei Gao, Shan Liu, Ge Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite alleviating the dependence on dense annotations inherent to fully supervised methods, weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation suffers from inadequate supervision signals. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective that imparts auxiliary constraints by regulating the feature space under weak supervision. Our initial investigation identifies which distributions accurately characterize the feature space, subsequently leveraging this priori to guide the alignment of the weakly supervised embeddings. Specifically, we analyze the superiority of the mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions (moVMF) among several common distribution candidates. Accordingly, we develop a Distribution Guidance Network (DGNet), which comprises a weakly supervised learning branch and a distribution alignment branch. Leveraging reliable clustering initialization derived from the weakly supervised learning branch, the distribution alignment branch alternately updates the parameters of the moVMF and the network, ensuring alignment with the moVMF-defined latent space. Extensive experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of our distribution choice and network design. Consequently, DGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under multiple datasets and various weakly supervised settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Huang, Chengrui Dong, Peidong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representation and explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for novel view synthesis have achieved remarkable progress with frame-based camera (e.g. RGB and RGB-D cameras) recently. Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

<p>Abstract: As large vision-language models (LVLMs) evolve rapidly, the demand for high-quality and diverse data to align these models becomes increasingly crucial. However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of AI feedback for vision-language alignment, we train Silkie, an LVLM fine-tuned via direct preference optimization on VLFeedback. Silkie showcases exceptional performance regarding helpfulness, visual faithfulness, and safety metrics. It outperforms its base model by 6.9\% and 9.5\% in perception and cognition tasks, reduces hallucination issues on MMHal-Bench, and exhibits enhanced resilience against red-teaming attacks. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the advantage of AI feedback, particularly in fostering preference diversity to deliver more comprehensive improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyan Chen, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamin Wu, Kenkun Liu, Yukai Shi, Xiaoke Jiang, Yuan Yao, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present UniG, a view-consistent 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis model that generates a high-fidelity representation of 3D Gaussians from sparse images. Existing 3D Gaussians-based methods usually regress Gaussians per-pixel of each view, create 3D Gaussians per view separately, and merge them through point concatenation. Such a view-independent reconstruction approach often results in a view inconsistency issue, where the predicted positions of the same 3D point from different views may have discrepancies. To address this problem, we develop a DETR (DEtection TRansformer)-like framework, which treats 3D Gaussians as decoder queries and updates their parameters layer by layer by performing multi-view cross-attention (MVDFA) over multiple input images. In this way, multiple views naturally contribute to modeling a unitary representation of 3D Gaussians, thereby making 3D reconstruction more view-consistent. Moreover, as the number of 3D Gaussians used as decoder queries is irrespective of the number of input views, allow an arbitrary number of input images without causing memory explosion. Extensive experiments validate the advantages of our approach, showcasing superior performance over existing methods quantitatively (improving PSNR by 4.2 dB when trained on Objaverse and tested on the GSO benchmark) and qualitatively.

<p>Abstract: Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring retinal vascular issues but is limited by its invasive nature and restricted accessibility compared to color fundus (CF) imaging. Existing methods that convert CF images to FFA are confined to static image generation, missing the dynamic lesional changes. We introduce Fundus2Video, an autoregressive generative adversarial network (GAN) model that generates dynamic FFA videos from single CF images. Fundus2Video excels in video generation, achieving an FVD of 1497.12 and a PSNR of 11.77. Clinical experts have validated the fidelity of the generated videos. Additionally, the model's generator demonstrates remarkable downstream transferability across ten external public datasets, including blood vessel segmentation, retinal disease diagnosis, systemic disease prediction, and multimodal retrieval, showcasing impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. These findings position Fundus2Video as a powerful, non-invasive alternative to FFA exams and a versatile retinal generative foundation model that captures both static and temporal retinal features, enabling the representation of complex inter-modality relationships.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonhyeon Song, Seohwan Yun, Seongho Yoon, Joohyeok Kim, Sangmin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach beyond supervised learning for effective pathological image analysis, addressing the challenge of limited robust labeled data. Pathological diagnosis of diseases like cancer has conventionally relied on the evaluation of morphological features by physicians and pathologists. However, recent advancements in compute-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are gaining significant attention as diagnostic support tools. Although the advancement of deep learning has improved CAD significantly, segmentation models typically require large pixel-level annotated dataset, and such labeling is expensive. Existing studies not based on supervised approaches still struggle with limited generalization, and no practical approach has emerged yet. To address this issue, we present a weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) model by combining class activation map and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. For effective pretraining, we adopt the SAM-a foundation model that is pretrained on large datasets and operates in zero-shot configurations using only coarse prompts. The proposed approach transfer enhanced Attention Dropout Layer's knowledge to SAM, thereby generating pseudo-labels. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, experimental studies are conducted on histopathological breast cancer datasets. The proposed method outperformed other WSSS methods across three datasets, demonstrating its efficiency by achieving this with only 12GB of GPU memory during training.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13674">Diffusion Curriculum: Synthetic-to-Real Generative Curriculum Learning via Image-Guided Diffusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liang, Shweta Bhardwaj, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-rich visual understanding-the ability to process environments where dense textual content is integrated with visuals-is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interact effectively with structured environments. To enhance this capability, we propose synthesizing general multimodal instructions from webpage UIs using text-based large language models (LLMs). Despite lacking direct visual input, text-based LLMs are able to process structured text representations from webpage accessibility trees. These instructions are then paired with UI screenshots to train multimodal models. We introduce MultiUI, a dataset containing 7.3 million samples from 1 million websites, covering diverse multimodal tasks and UI layouts. Models trained on MultiUI not only excel in web UI tasks-achieving up to a 48% improvement on VisualWebBench and a 19.1% boost in element accuracy on a web agent dataset Mind2Web-but also generalize surprisingly well to non-web UI tasks and even to non-UI domains, such as document understanding, OCR, and chart interpretation. These results highlight the broad applicability of web UI data for advancing text-rich visual understanding across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Jianan Liu, Marianne Schell, Tao Huang, Arne Lauer, Katharina Schregel, Jessica Jesser, Dominik F Vollherbst, Martin Bendszus, Sabine Heiland, Tim Hilgenfeld</p>
<p>Abstract: Shortening acquisition time and reducing motion artifacts are the most critical challenges in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsu Kim, Hyung-Il Kim, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) aims to infer speech into text depending on lip movements alone. As it focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements, and this makes the VSR models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen speakers. In this paper, to remedy the performance degradation of the VSR model on unseen speakers, we propose prompt tuning methods of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for speaker-adaptive VSR. Specifically, motivated by recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we finetune prompts on adaptation data of target speakers instead of modifying the pre-trained model parameters. Different from the previous prompt tuning methods mainly limited to Transformer variant architecture, we explore different types of prompts, the addition, the padding, and the concatenation form prompts that can be applied to the VSR model which is composed of CNN and Transformer in general. With the proposed prompt tuning, we show that the performance of the pre-trained VSR model on unseen speakers can be largely improved by using a small amount of adaptation data (e.g., less than 5 minutes), even if the pre-trained model is already developed with large speaker variations. Moreover, by analyzing the performance and parameters of different types of prompts, we investigate when the prompt tuning is preferred over the finetuning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both word- and sentence-level VSR databases, LRW-ID and GRID.</p>

<p>Abstract: Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States and is estimated to affect one in five Americans. Recent advances have demonstrated strong performance on skin cancer detection, as exemplified by state of the art performance in the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge; however these solutions leverage ensembles of complex deep neural architectures requiring immense storage and compute costs, and therefore may not be tractable. A recent movement for TinyML applications is integrating Double-Condensing Attention Condensers (DC-AC) into a self-attention neural network backbone architecture to allow for faster and more efficient computation. This paper explores leveraging an efficient self-attention structure to detect skin cancer in skin lesion images and introduces a deep neural network design with DC-AC customized for skin cancer detection from skin lesion images. The final model is publicly available as a part of a global open-source initiative dedicated to accelerating advancement in machine learning to aid clinicians in the fight against cancer. Future work of this research includes iterating on the design of the selected network architecture and refining the approach to generalize to other forms of cancer.</p>

Meanwhile, developments in neural surface representation learning incorporate non-linear positional encoding, addressing issues like spectral bias; however, this poses challenges in applying mesh extraction techniques based on CPWA functions. Focusing on trilinear interpolating methods as positional encoding, we present theoretical insights and an analytical mesh extraction, showing the transformation of hypersurfaces to flat planes within the trilinear region under the eikonal constraint. Moreover, we introduce a method for approximating intersecting points among three hypersurfaces contributing to broader applications. We empirically validate correctness and parsimony through chamfer distance and efficiency, and angular distance, while examining the correlation between the eikonal loss and the planarity of the hypersurfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie Dohmen, Mark Klemens, Ivo Baltruschat, Tuan Truong, Matthias Lenga</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-image translation can create large impact in medical imaging, as images can be synthetically transformed to other modalities, sequence types, higher resolutions or lower noise levels. To ensure patient safety, these methods should be validated by human readers, which requires a considerable amount of time and costs. Quantitative metrics can effectively complement such studies and provide reproducible and objective assessment of synthetic images. If a reference is available, the similarity of MR images is frequently evaluated by SSIM and PSNR metrics, even though these metrics are not or too sensitive regarding specific distortions. When reference images to compare with are not available, non-reference quality metrics can reliably detect specific distortions, such as blurriness. To provide an overview on distortion sensitivity, we quantitatively analyze 11 similarity (reference) and 12 quality (non-reference) metrics for assessing synthetic images. We additionally include a metric on a downstream segmentation task. We investigate the sensitivity regarding 11 kinds of distortions and typical MR artifacts, and analyze the influence of different normalization methods on each metric and distortion. Finally, we derive recommendations for effective usage of the analyzed similarity and quality metrics for evaluation of image-to-image translation models.</p>

We provide an additional network for the vertebra segments 22 individual vertebra types. Results: We achieved an average Dice score of 0.89 +- 0.07 overall 71 segmentation labels. We scored > 0.90 Dice-score on the abdominal organs except for the pancreas with a Dice of 0.70. Conclusion: Our work offers a detailed and refined publicly available full torso segmentation on VIBE images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Tang, Shohreh Deldari, Hao Xue, Celso De Melo, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Video language continual learning involves continuously adapting to information from video and text inputs, enhancing a model's ability to handle new tasks while retaining prior knowledge. This field is a relatively under-explored area, and establishing appropriate datasets is crucial for facilitating communication and research in this field. In this study, we present the first dedicated benchmark, ViLCo-Bench, designed to evaluate continual learning models across a range of video-text tasks. The dataset comprises ten-minute-long videos and corresponding language queries collected from publicly available datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-efficient framework that incorporates self-supervised learning and mimics long-term and short-term memory effects. This framework addresses challenges including memory complexity from long video clips, natural language complexity from open queries, and text-video misalignment. We posit that ViLCo-Bench, with greater complexity compared to existing continual learning benchmarks, would serve as a critical tool for exploring the video-language domain, extending beyond conventional class-incremental tasks, and addressing complex and limited annotation issues. The curated data, evaluations, and our novel method are available at https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/ViLCo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengdan Zhu, Raasikh Kanjiani, Jiahui Lu, Andrew Choi, Qirui Ye, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models like VAEs and diffusion models have advanced various generation tasks by leveraging latent variables to learn data distributions and generate high-quality samples. Despite the field of explainable AI making strides in interpreting machine learning models, understanding latent variables in generative models remains challenging. This paper introduces \textit{LatentExplainer}, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. \textit{LatentExplainer} tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interpreting changes in generated data, and uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating inductive biases and uncertainty quantification, significantly enhancing model interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Determining the chronology of ancient handwritten manuscripts is essential for reconstructing the evolution of ideas. For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is particularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of date-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in similar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch, a state-of-the-art AI-based date-prediction model, trained on the basis of new radiocarbon-dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established handwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The challenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is small, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data. We show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature vectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the radiocarbon-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with varied MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the radiocarbon dating. Enoch was then used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79 per cent of the samples were considered 'realistic' upon palaeographic post-hoc evaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The radiocarbon ranges and Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally assumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date prediction provides an improved granularity. The study is in line with current developments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This research shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a tool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and contributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05617">Residual-INR: Communication Efficient On-Device Learning Using Implicit Neural Representation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqiu Chen, Xuebin Yao, Pradeep Subedi, Cong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharclab/Residual-INR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Yu, Baolin Peng, Vineeth Vajipey, Hao Cheng, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao, Zhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we present ExACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test time algorithm designed to enhance AI agents' ability to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate for reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge and experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10551">Preserving Cardiac Integrity: A Topology-Infused Approach to Whole Heart Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhang, Wenxue Guan, Xiaodan Xing, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole heart segmentation (WHS) supports cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, disease monitoring, treatment planning, and prognosis. Deep learning has become the most widely used method for WHS applications in recent years. However, segmentation of whole-heart structures faces numerous challenges including heart shape variability during the cardiac cycle, clinical artifacts like motion and poor contrast-to-noise ratio, domain shifts in multi-center data, and the distinct modalities of CT and MRI. To address these limitations and improve segmentation quality, this paper introduces a new topology-preserving module that is integrated into deep neural networks. The implementation achieves anatomically plausible segmentation by using learned topology-preserving fields, which are based entirely on 3D convolution and are therefore very effective for 3D voxel data. We incorporate natural constraints between structures into the end-to-end training and enrich the feature representation of the neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on an open-source medical heart dataset, specifically using the WHS++ data. The results demonstrate that the architecture performs exceptionally well, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.939 during testing. This indicates full topology preservation for individual structures and significantly outperforms other baselines in preserving the overall scene topology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghao Li, Yu Cao, Qi Chen, Yifan Yang, Jian Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: In point-line SLAM systems, the utilization of line structural information and the optimization of lines are two significant problems. The former is usually addressed through structural regularities, while the latter typically involves using minimal parameter representations of lines in optimization. However, separating these two steps leads to the loss of constraint information to each other. We anchor lines with similar directions to a principal axis and optimize them with $n+2$ parameters for $n$ lines, solving both problems together. Our method considers scene structural information, which can be easily extended to different world hypotheses while significantly reducing the number of line parameters to be optimized, enabling rapid and accurate mapping and tracking. To further enhance the system's robustness and avoid mismatch, we have modeled the line-axis probabilistic data association and provided the algorithm for axis creation, updating, and optimization. Additionally, considering that most real-world scenes conform to the Atlanta World hypothesis, we provide a structural line detection strategy based on vertical priors and vanishing points. Experimental results and ablation studies on various indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jameson Merkow, Felix J. Dorfner, Xiyu Yang, Alexander Ersoy, Giridhar Dasegowda, Mannudeep Kalra, Matthew P. Lungren, Christopher P. Bridge, Ivan Tarapov</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging has advanced clinical diagnostics but poses challenges in managing model drift and ensuring long-term reliability. To address these challenges, we develop MMC+, an enhanced framework for scalable drift monitoring, building upon the CheXstray framework that introduced real-time drift detection for medical imaging AI models using multi-modal data concordance. This work extends the original framework's methodologies, providing a more scalable and adaptable solution for real-world healthcare settings and offers a reliable and cost-effective alternative to continuous performance monitoring addressing limitations of both continuous and periodic monitoring methods. MMC+ introduces critical improvements to the original framework, including more robust handling of diverse data streams, improved scalability with the integration of foundation models like MedImageInsight for high-dimensional image embeddings without site-specific training, and the introduction of uncertainty bounds to better capture drift in dynamic clinical environments. Validated with real-world data from Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, MMC+ effectively detects significant data shifts and correlates them with model performance changes. While not directly predicting performance degradation, MMC+ serves as an early warning system, indicating when AI systems may deviate from acceptable performance bounds and enabling timely interventions. By emphasizing the importance of monitoring diverse data streams and evaluating data shifts alongside model performance, this work contributes to the broader adoption and integration of AI solutions in clinical settings.</p>
