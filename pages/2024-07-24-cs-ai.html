<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Deliu, Bibhas Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision health, increasingly supported by digital technologies, is a domain of research that broadens the paradigm of precision medicine, advancing everyday healthcare. This vision goes hand in hand with the groundbreaking advent of artificial intelligence (AI), which is reshaping the way we diagnose, treat, and monitor both clinical subjects and the general population. AI tools powered by machine learning have shown considerable improvements in a variety of healthcare domains. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for sequential and dynamic problems such as dynamic treatment regimes and just-in-time adaptive interventions in digital health. In this work, we discuss the opportunity offered by AI, more specifically RL, to current trends in healthcare, providing a methodological survey of RL methods in the context of precision and digital health. Focusing on the area of adaptive interventions, we expand the methodological survey with illustrative case studies that used RL in real practice.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16160">UniMEL: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Liu Qi, He Yongyi, Lian Defu, Zheng Zhi, Xu Tong, Liu Che, Chen Enhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) is a crucial task that aims at linking ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to the referent entities in a multimodal knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. Existing methods focus heavily on using complex mechanisms and extensive model tuning methods to model the multimodal interaction on specific datasets. However, these methods overcomplicate the MEL task and overlook the visual semantic information, which makes them costly and hard to scale. Moreover, these methods can not solve the issues like textual ambiguity, redundancy, and noisy images, which severely degrade their performance. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust capabilities in text understanding and reasoning, particularly Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that can process multimodal inputs, provides new insights into addressing this challenge. However, how to design a universally applicable LLMs-based MEL approach remains a pressing challenge. To this end, we propose UniMEL, a unified framework which establishes a new paradigm to process multimodal entity linking tasks using LLMs. In this framework, we employ LLMs to augment the representation of mentions and entities individually by integrating textual and visual information and refining textual information. Subsequently, we employ the embedding-based method for retrieving and re-ranking candidate entities. Then, with only ~0.26% of the model parameters fine-tuned, LLMs can make the final selection from the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16190">Artificial Agency and Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maud Van Lier, Gorka Mu\~noz-Gil</p>
<p>Abstract: The arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stirred up philosophical debates about the possibility of realizing agency in an artificial manner. In this work we contribute to the debate by presenting a theoretical model that can be used as a threshold conception for artificial agents. The model defines agents as systems whose actions and goals are always influenced by a dynamic framework of factors that consists of the agent's accessible history, its adaptive repertoire and its external environment. This framework, in turn, is influenced by the actions that the agent takes and the goals that it forms. We show with the help of the model that state-of-the-art LLMs are not agents yet, but that there are elements to them that suggest a way forward. The paper argues that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al. (2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al. (2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner. We end the paper by reflecting on the obstacles one might face in building such an artificial agent and by presenting possible directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milan Tomy, Konstantin M. Seiler, Andrew J. Hill</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous transportation of material in the mining industry is achieved by the dispatch of autonomous haul-trucks with discrete haulage capacities. Recently, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was successfully deployed in tackling challenges of long-run optimality, scalability and adaptability in haul-truck dispatch. Typically, operational constraints imposed on the mine site are satisfied by heuristic controllers or human operators independent of the dispatch planning. This article incorporates operational constraint satisfaction into the dispatch planning by utilising the MCTS based dispatch planner Flow-Achieving Scheduling Tree (FAST). Operational constraint violation and satisfaction are modelled as opportunity costs in the combinatorial optimisation problem of dispatch. Explicit cost formulations are avoided by utilising MCTS generator models to derive opportunity costs. Experimental studies with four types of operational constraints demonstrate the success of utilising opportunity costs for constraint satisfaction, and the effectiveness of integrating constraints into dispatch planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matan Shamir, Osher Elhadad, Matthew E. Taylor, Reuth Mirsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems are aimed at optimization of the behavior of an agent. This paper proposes a novel take on RL, which is used to learn the policy of another agent, to allow real-time recognition of that agent's goals. Goal Recognition (GR) has traditionally been framed as a planning problem where one must recognize an agent's objectives based on its observed actions. Recent approaches have shown how reinforcement learning can be used as part of the GR pipeline, but are limited to recognizing predefined goals and lack scalability in domains with a large goal space. This paper formulates a novel problem, "Online Dynamic Goal Recognition" (ODGR), as a first step to address these limitations. Contributions include introducing the concept of dynamic goals into the standard GR problem definition, revisiting common approaches by reformulating them using ODGR, and demonstrating the feasibility of solving ODGR in a navigation domain using transfer learning. These novel formulations open the door for future extensions of existing transfer learning-based GR methods, which will be robust to changing and expansive real-time environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Luttermann, Johann Machemer, Marcel Gehrke</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifted probabilistic inference exploits symmetries in probabilistic graphical models to allow for tractable probabilistic inference with respect to domain sizes. To exploit symmetries in, e.g., factor graphs, it is crucial to identify commutative factors, i.e., factors having symmetries within themselves due to their arguments being exchangeable. The current state of the art to check whether a factor is commutative with respect to a subset of its arguments iterates over all possible subsets of the factor's arguments, i.e., $O(2^n)$ iterations for a factor with $n$ arguments in the worst case. In this paper, we efficiently solve the problem of detecting commutative factors in a factor graph. In particular, we introduce the detection of commutative factors (DECOR) algorithm, which allows us to drastically reduce the computational effort for checking whether a factor is commutative in practice. We prove that DECOR efficiently identifies restrictions to drastically reduce the number of required iterations and validate the efficiency of DECOR in our empirical evaluation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16318">PrimeGuard: Safe and Helpful LLMs through Tuning-Free Routing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Blazej Manczak, Eliott Zemour, Eric Lin, Vaikkunth Mugunthan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) necessitates outputs to be both high-quality and compliant with safety guidelines. Although Inference-Time Guardrails (ITG) offer solutions that shift model output distributions towards compliance, we find that current methods struggle in balancing safety with helpfulness. ITG Methods that safely address non-compliant queries exhibit lower helpfulness while those that prioritize helpfulness compromise on safety. We refer to this trade-off as the guardrail tax, analogous to the alignment tax. To address this, we propose PrimeGuard, a novel ITG method that utilizes structured control flow.
  PrimeGuard routes requests to different self-instantiations of the LM with varying instructions, leveraging its inherent instruction-following capabilities and in-context learning. Our tuning-free approach dynamically compiles system-designer guidelines for each query. We construct and release safe-eval, a diverse red-team safety benchmark. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PrimeGuard, without fine-tuning, overcomes the guardrail tax by (1) significantly increasing resistance to iterative jailbreak attacks and (2) achieving state-of-the-art results in safety guardrailing while (3) matching helpfulness scores of alignment-tuned models. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PrimeGuard, without fine-tuning, outperforms all competing baselines and overcomes the guardrail tax by improving the fraction of safe responses from 61% to 97% and increasing average helpfulness scores from 4.17 to 4.29 on the largest models, while reducing attack success rate from 100% to 8%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexing Gao, Dmitry Rodin, Vasily Motolygin, Denis Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a popular approach, which aims to represent entities and relations of a knowledge graph in latent spaces. Their representations are known as embeddings. To measure the plausibility of triplets, score functions are defined over embedding spaces. Despite wide dissemination of KGE in various tasks, KGE methods have limitations in reasoning abilities. In this paper we propose a mathematical framework to compare reasoning abilities of KGE methods. We show that STransE has a higher capability than TransComplEx, and then present new STransCoRe method, which improves the STransE by combining it with the TransCoRe insights, which can reduce the STransE space complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajitha Ramanayake, Vivek Nallur</p>
<p>Abstract: The common consensus is that robots designed to work alongside or serve humans must adhere to the ethical standards of their operational environment. To achieve this, several methods based on established ethical theories have been suggested. Nonetheless, numerous empirical studies show that the ethical requirements of the real world are very diverse and can change rapidly from region to region. This eliminates the idea of a universal robot that can fit into any ethical context. However, creating customised robots for each deployment, using existing techniques is challenging. This paper presents a way to overcome this challenge by introducing a virtue ethics inspired computational method that enables character-based tuning of robots to accommodate the specific ethical needs of an environment. Using a simulated elder-care environment, we illustrate how tuning can be used to change the behaviour of a robot that interacts with an elderly resident in an ambient-assisted environment. Further, we assess the robot's responses by consulting ethicists to identify potential shortcomings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16444">Psychomatics -- A Multidisciplinary Framework for Understanding Artificial Minds</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Riva, Fabrizia Mantovani, Brenda K. Wiederhold, Antonella Marchetti, Andrea Gaggioli</p>
<p>Abstract: Although LLMs and other artificial intelligence systems demonstrate cognitive skills similar to humans, like concept learning and language acquisition, the way they process information fundamentally differs from biological cognition. To better understand these differences this paper introduces Psychomatics, a multidisciplinary framework bridging cognitive science, linguistics, and computer science. It aims to better understand the high-level functioning of LLMs, focusing specifically on how LLMs acquire, learn, remember, and use information to produce their outputs. To achieve this goal, Psychomatics will rely on a comparative methodology, starting from a theory-driven research question - is the process of language development and use different in humans and LLMs? - drawing parallels between LLMs and biological systems. Our analysis shows how LLMs can map and manipulate complex linguistic patterns in their training data. Moreover, LLMs can follow Grice's Cooperative Principle to provide relevant and informative responses. However, human cognition draws from multiple sources of meaning, including experiential, emotional, and imaginative facets, which transcend mere language processing and are rooted in our social and developmental trajectories. Moreover, current LLMs lack physical embodiment, reducing their ability to make sense of the intricate interplay between perception, action, and cognition that shapes human understanding and expression. Ultimately, Psychomatics holds the potential to yield transformative insights into the nature of language, cognition, and intelligence, both artificial and biological. Moreover, by drawing parallels between LLMs and human cognitive processes, Psychomatics can inform the development of more robust and human-like AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sujin Jeon, Suyeon Shin, Byoung-Tak Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a task of planning a long sequence of sub-goals given high-level natural language instructions, such as "Rinse a slice of lettuce and place on the white table next to the fork". To successfully execute these long-term horizon tasks, we argue that an agent must consider its past, i.e., historical data, when making decisions in each step. Nevertheless, recent approaches in EIF often neglects the knowledge from historical data and also do not effectively utilize information across the modalities. To this end, we propose History-Aware Planning based on Fused Information (HAPFI), effectively leveraging the historical data from diverse modalities that agents collect while interacting with the environment. Specifically, HAPFI integrates multiple modalities, including historical RGB observations, bounding boxes, sub-goals, and high-level instructions, by effectively fusing modalities via our Mutually Attentive Fusion method. Through experiments with diverse comparisons, we show that an agent utilizing historical multi-modal information surpasses all the compared methods that neglect the historical data in terms of action planning capability, enabling the generation of well-informed action plans for the next step. Moreover, we provided qualitative evidence highlighting the significance of leveraging historical multi-modal data, particularly in scenarios where the agent encounters intermediate failures, showcasing its robust re-planning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models in medical imaging represents a significant leap toward enhancing diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment. However, the deployment of foundation models in healthcare necessitates a rigorous examination of their trustworthiness, encompassing privacy, robustness, reliability, explainability, and fairness. The current body of survey literature on foundation models in medical imaging reveals considerable gaps, particularly in the area of trustworthiness. Additionally, extant surveys on the trustworthiness of foundation models fail to address their specific variations and applications within the medical imaging domain. This survey paper reviews the current research on foundation models in the major medical imaging applications, with a focus on segmentation, medical report generation, medical question and answering (Q&A), and disease diagnosis, which includes trustworthiness discussion in their manuscripts. We explore the complex challenges of making foundation models for medical image analysis trustworthy, associated with each application, and summarize the current concerns and strategies to enhance trustworthiness. Furthermore, we explore the future promises of these models in revolutionizing patient care. Our analysis underscores the imperative for advancing towards trustworthy AI in medical image analysis, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring ethical and equitable healthcare delivery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the text-to-image diffusion model has gained considerable attention from the community due to its exceptional image generation capability. A representative model, Stable Diffusion, amassed more than 10 million users within just two months of its release. This surge in popularity has facilitated studies on the robustness and safety of the model, leading to the proposal of various adversarial attack methods. Simultaneously, there has been a marked increase in research focused on defense methods to improve the robustness and safety of these models. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on adversarial attacks and defenses targeting text-to-image diffusion models. We begin with an overview of text-to-image diffusion models, followed by an introduction to a taxonomy of adversarial attacks and an in-depth review of existing attack methods. We then present a detailed analysis of current defense methods that improve model robustness and safety. Finally, we discuss ongoing challenges and explore promising future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhong Wei, Ying Cui, Mengwei Ding, Yanqin Wang, Lingling Xiang, Zhengxiong Yao, Ceran Chen, Ying Long, Zhezhen Jin, Ximing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential applications in medicine, yet data privacy and computational burden limit their deployment in healthcare institutions. Open-source and lightweight versions of LLMs emerge as potential solutions, but their performance, particularly in pediatric settings remains underexplored. In this cross-sectional study, 250 patient consultation questions were randomly selected from a public online medical forum, with 10 questions from each of 25 pediatric departments, spanning from December 1, 2022, to October 30, 2023. Two lightweight open-source LLMs, ChatGLM3-6B and Vicuna-7B, along with a larger-scale model, Vicuna-13B, and the widely-used proprietary ChatGPT-3.5, independently answered these questions in Chinese between November 1, 2023, and November 7, 2023. To assess reproducibility, each inquiry was replicated once. We found that ChatGLM3-6B demonstrated higher accuracy and completeness than Vicuna-13B and Vicuna-7B (P < .001), but all were outperformed by ChatGPT-3.5. ChatGPT-3.5 received the highest ratings in accuracy (65.2%) compared to ChatGLM3-6B (41.2%), Vicuna-13B (11.2%), and Vicuna-7B (4.4%). Similarly, in completeness, ChatGPT-3.5 led (78.4%), followed by ChatGLM3-6B (76.0%), Vicuna-13B (34.8%), and Vicuna-7B (22.0%) in highest ratings. ChatGLM3-6B matched ChatGPT-3.5 in readability, both outperforming Vicuna models (P < .001). In terms of empathy, ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed the lightweight LLMs (P < .001). In safety, all models performed comparably well (P > .05), with over 98.4% of responses being rated as safe. Repetition of inquiries confirmed these findings. In conclusion, Lightweight LLMs demonstrate promising application in pediatric healthcare. However, the observed gap between lightweight and large-scale proprietary LLMs underscores the need for continued development efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Krystal Sun, Sanchari Sen, Swagath Venkataramani, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that, during the inference on generative AI models such as transformer, the importance of different weights exhibits substantial context-dependent variations. This naturally manifests a promising potential of adaptively configuring weight quantization to improve the generative AI inference efficiency. Although configurable weight quantization can readily leverage the hardware support of variable-precision arithmetics in modern GPU and AI accelerators, little prior research has studied how one could exploit variable weight quantization to proportionally improve the AI model memory access speed and energy efficiency. Motivated by the rapidly maturing CXL ecosystem, this work develops a CXL-based design solution to fill this gap. The key is to allow CXL memory controllers play an active role in supporting and exploiting runtime configurable weight quantization. Using transformer as a representative generative AI model, we carried out experiments that well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Ma, Yikai Hou, Xiang Li, Yinggang Sun, Haining Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Short fixed-length inputs are the main bottleneck of deep learning methods in long time-series forecasting tasks. Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}. Sufficient context enhances performance(\textit{38% maximum precision improvement}), and the decoupling approach offers \textit{Low complexity($0.22\times$ cost)} and \textit{high interpretability}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orfeas Menis-Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Filandrianos, Jason Liartis, Edmund Dervakos, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models and datasets increase in complexity, the demand for methods that enhance explainability and interpretability becomes paramount. Prototypes, by encapsulating essential characteristics within data, offer insights that enable tactical decision-making and enhance transparency. Traditional prototype methods often rely on sub-symbolic raw data and opaque latent spaces, reducing explainability and increasing the risk of misinterpretations. This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes semantic descriptions to define prototypes and provide clear explanations, effectively addressing the shortcomings of conventional methods. Our approach leverages concept-based descriptions to cluster data on the semantic level, ensuring that prototypes not only represent underlying properties intuitively but are also straightforward to interpret. Our method simplifies the interpretative process and effectively bridges the gap between complex data structures and human cognitive processes, thereby enhancing transparency and fostering trust. Our approach outperforms existing widely-used prototype methods in facilitating human understanding and informativeness, as validated through a user survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang, Yonghong Song, Pengcheng Guo, Yangyang Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a growing demand in the field of KIE (Key Information Extraction) to apply semi-supervised learning to save manpower and costs, as training document data using fully-supervised methods requires labor-intensive manual annotation. The main challenges of applying SSL in the KIE are (1) underestimation of the confidence of tail classes in the long-tailed distribution and (2) difficulty in achieving intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of tail features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach for KIE with Class-Rebalancing and Merged Semantic Pseudo-Labeling (CRMSP). Firstly, the Class-Rebalancing Pseudo-Labeling (CRP) module introduces a reweighting factor to rebalance pseudo-labels, increasing attention to tail classes. Secondly, we propose the Merged Semantic Pseudo-Labeling (MSP) module to cluster tail features of unlabeled data by assigning samples to Merged Prototypes (MP). Additionally, we designed a new contrastive loss specifically for MSP. Extensive experimental results on three well-known benchmarks demonstrate that CRMSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, CRMSP achieves 3.24% f1-score improvement over state-of-the-art on the CORD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Akbar Husnoo, Adnan Anwar, Md Enamul Haque, A. N. Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing security and privacy concerns in the Smart Grid sector have led to a significant demand for robust intrusion detection systems within critical smart grid infrastructure. To address the challenges posed by privacy preservation and decentralized power system zones with distinct data ownership, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution which facilitates collaborative training of attack detection models without necessitating the sharing of raw data. However, FL presents several implementation limitations in the power system domain due to its heavy reliance on a centralized aggregator and the risks of privacy leakage during model update transmission. To overcome these technical bottlenecks, this paper introduces a novel decentralized federated anomaly detection scheme based on two main gossip protocols namely Random Walk and Epidemic. Our findings indicate that the Random Walk protocol exhibits superior performance compared to the Epidemic protocol, highlighting its efficacy in decentralized federated learning environments. Experimental validation of the proposed framework utilizing publicly available industrial control systems datasets demonstrates superior attack detection accuracy while safeguarding data confidentiality and mitigating the impact of communication latency and stragglers. Furthermore, our approach yields a notable 35% improvement in training time compared to conventional FL, underscoring the efficacy and robustness of our decentralized learning method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqing Lyu, Changjie Chen, Bing Liang, Yijia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The AIDS epidemic has killed 40 million people and caused serious global problems. The identification of new HIV-inhibiting molecules is of great importance for combating the AIDS epidemic. Here, the Classifier Guidance Diffusion model and ligand-based virtual screening strategy are combined to discover potential HIV-inhibiting molecules for the first time. We call it Diff4VS. An extra classifier is trained using the HIV molecule dataset, and the gradient of the classifier is used to guide the Diffusion to generate HIV-inhibiting molecules. Experiments show that Diff4VS can generate more candidate HIV-inhibiting molecules than other methods. Inspired by ligand-based virtual screening, a new metric DrugIndex is proposed. The DrugIndex is the ratio of the proportion of candidate drug molecules in the generated molecule to the proportion of candidate drug molecules in the training set. DrugIndex provides a new evaluation method for evolving molecular generative models from a pharmaceutical perspective. Besides, we report a new phenomenon observed when using molecule generation models for virtual screening. Compared to real molecules, the generated molecules have a lower proportion that is highly similar to known drug molecules. We call it Degradation in molecule generation. Based on the data analysis, the Degradation may result from the difficulty of generating molecules with a specific structure in the generative model. Our research contributes to the application of generative models in drug design from method, metric, and phenomenon analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chong, Xiao Dong, Haoxiang Li, Shiyue Zhang, Wenqing Zhang, Xujie Zhang, Hanqing Zhao, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic try-on effects but often replicate the backbone network as a ReferenceNet or use additional image encoders to process condition inputs, leading to high training and inference costs. In this work, we rethink the necessity of ReferenceNet and image encoders and innovate the interaction between garment and person by proposing CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model. CatVTON facilitates the seamless transfer of in-shop or worn garments of any category to target persons by simply concatenating them in spatial dimensions as inputs. The efficiency of our model is demonstrated in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network: Only the original diffusion modules are used, without additional network modules. The text encoder and cross-attentions for text injection in the backbone are removed, reducing the parameters by 167.02M. (2) Parameter-efficient training: We identified the try-on relevant modules through experiments and achieved high-quality try-on effects by training only 49.57M parameters, approximately 5.51 percent of the backbone network's parameters. (3) Simplified inference: CatVTON eliminates all unnecessary conditions and preprocessing steps, including pose estimation, human parsing, and text input, requiring only a garment reference, target person image, and mask for the virtual try-on process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer prerequisites and trainable parameters than baseline methods. Furthermore, CatVTON shows good generalization in in-the-wild scenarios despite using open-source datasets with only 73K samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuepeng Chen, Weiping Ding, Hengrong Ju, Jiashuang Huang, Tao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is a vital technique in machine learning, as it can reduce computational complexity, improve model performance, and mitigate the risk of overfitting. However, the increasing complexity and dimensionality of datasets pose significant challenges in the selection of features. Focusing on these challenges, this paper proposes a cascaded two-stage feature clustering and selection algorithm for fuzzy decision systems. In the first stage, we reduce the search space by clustering relevant features and addressing inter-feature redundancy. In the second stage, a clustering-based sequentially forward selection method that explores the global and local structure of data is presented. We propose a novel metric for assessing the significance of features, which considers both global separability and local consistency. Global separability measures the degree of intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation based on fuzzy membership, providing a comprehensive understanding of data separability. Meanwhile, local consistency leverages the fuzzy neighborhood rough set model to capture uncertainty and fuzziness in the data. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is evaluated through experiments conducted on 18 public datasets and a real-world schizophrenia dataset. The experiment results demonstrate our algorithm's superiority over benchmarking algorithms in both classification accuracy and the number of selected features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Gong, Huaiyu Wan, Shengnan Guo, Xiucheng Li, Yan Lin, Erwen Zheng, Tianyi Wang, Zeyu Zhou, Youfang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) has yielded massive amounts of data on human mobility. Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehshan Ahmed Khan, Houshyar Asadi, Mohammad Reza Chalak Qazani, Adetokunbo Arogbonlo, Siamak Pedrammehr, Adnan Anwar, Asim Bhatti, Saeid Nahavandi, Chee Peng Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is employed as a non-invasive method to monitor functional brain activation by capturing changes in the concentrations of oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated haemo-globin (HbR). Various machine learning classification techniques have been utilized to distinguish cognitive states. However, conventional machine learning methods, although simpler to implement, undergo a complex pre-processing phase before network training and demonstrate reduced accuracy due to inadequate data preprocessing. Additionally, previous research in cog-nitive load assessment using fNIRS has predominantly focused on differ-sizeentiating between two levels of mental workload. These studies mainly aim to classify low and high levels of cognitive load or distinguish between easy and difficult tasks. To address these limitations associated with conven-tional methods, this paper conducts a comprehensive exploration of the im-pact of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers on the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within deep learning models. This is to address the issues related to spatial features overfitting and lack of tem-poral dependencies in CNN in the previous studies. By integrating LSTM layers, the model can capture temporal dependencies in the fNIRS data, al-lowing for a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive states. The primary objective is to assess how incorporating LSTM layers enhances the performance of CNNs. The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate that the integration of LSTM layers with Convolutional layers results in an increase in the accuracy of deep learning models from 97.40% to 97.92%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B. Kaan Karamete, Eli Glaser</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper discusses how to generate general graph node embeddings from knowledge graph representations. The embedded space is composed of a number of sub-features to mimic both local affinity and remote structural relevance. These sub-feature dimensions are defined by several indicators that we speculate to catch nodal similarities, such as hop-based topological patterns, the number of overlapping labels, the transitional probabilities (markov-chain probabilities), and the cluster indices computed by our recursive spectral bisection (RSB) algorithm. These measures are flattened over the one dimensional vector space into their respective sub-component ranges such that the entire set of vector similarity functions could be used for finding similar nodes. The error is defined by the sum of pairwise square differences across a randomly selected sample of graph nodes between the assumed embeddings and the ground truth estimates as our novel loss function. The ground truth is estimated to be a combination of pairwise Jaccard similarity and the number of overlapping labels. Finally, we demonstrate a multi-variate stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to compute the weighing factors among sub-vector spaces to minimize the average error using a random sampling logic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have reached a very significant level of accuracy. While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from the past five years, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this paper, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI's application in the finance industry, this paper provides a comprehensive view of XAI's current role in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most appropriate XAI approach for future applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over summer 2024, the world will be looking at Paris to encourage their favorite athletes win the Olympic gold medal. In handball, few nations will fight hard to win the precious metal with speculations predicting the victory for France or Denmark for men and France or Norway for women. However, there is so far no scientific method proposed to predict the final results of the competition. In this work, we leverage a deep learning model to predict the results of the handball tournament of the 2024 Olympic Games. This model, coupled with explainable AI (xAI) techniques, allows us to extract insightful information about the main factors influencing the outcome of each match. Notably, xAI helps sports experts understand how factors like match information or individual athlete performance contribute to the predictions. Furthermore, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-friendly explanations that highlight the most important factors impacting the match results. By providing human-centric explanations, our approach offers a deeper understanding of the AI predictions, making them more actionable for coaches and analysts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ikhtiyor Nematov, Dimitris Sacharidis, Tomer Sagi, Katja Hose</p>
<p>Abstract: For many use-cases, it is often important to explain the prediction of a black-box model by identifying the most influential training data samples. Existing approaches lack customization for user intent and often provide a homogeneous set of explanation samples, failing to reveal the model's reasoning from different angles.
  In this paper, we propose AIDE, an approach for providing antithetical (i.e., contrastive), intent-based, diverse explanations for opaque and complex models. AIDE distinguishes three types of explainability intents: interpreting a correct, investigating a wrong, and clarifying an ambiguous prediction. For each intent, AIDE selects an appropriate set of influential training samples that support or oppose the prediction either directly or by contrast. To provide a succinct summary, AIDE uses diversity-aware sampling to avoid redundancy and increase coverage of the training data.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of AIDE on image and text classification tasks, in three ways: quantitatively, assessing correctness and continuity; qualitatively, comparing anecdotal evidence from AIDE and other example-based approaches; and via a user study, evaluating multiple aspects of AIDE. The results show that AIDE addresses the limitations of existing methods and exhibits desirable traits for an explainability method.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the adaptation of Transformerbased models for edge devices through the quantisation and hardware acceleration of the ARM Keyword Transformer (KWT) model on a RISC-V platform. The model was targeted to run on 64kB RAM in bare-metal C using a custom-developed edge AI library. KWT-1 was retrained to be 369 times smaller, with only a 10% loss in accuracy through reducing output classes from 35 to 2. The retraining and quantisation reduced model size from 2.42 MB to 1.65 kB. The integration of custom RISC-V instructions that accelerated GELU and SoftMax operations enabled a 5x speedup and thus ~5x power reduction in inference, with inference clock cycle counts decreasing from 26 million to 5.5 million clock cycles while incurring a small area overhead of approximately 29%. The results demonstrate a viable method for porting and accelerating Transformer-based models in low-power IoT devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuluhan Binici, Weiming Wu, Tulika Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a model compression method that entails training a compact student model to emulate the performance of a more complex teacher model. However, the architectural capacity gap between the two models limits the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Addressing this issue, previous works focused on customizing teacher-student pairs to improve compatibility, a computationally expensive process that needs to be repeated every time either model changes. Hence, these methods are impractical when a teacher model has to be compressed into different student models for deployment on multiple hardware devices with distinct resource constraints. In this work, we propose Generic Teacher Network (GTN), a one-off KD-aware training to create a generic teacher capable of effectively transferring knowledge to any student model sampled from a given finite pool of architectures. To this end, we represent the student pool as a weight-sharing supernet and condition our generic teacher to align with the capacities of various student architectures sampled from this supernet. Experimental evaluation shows that our method both improves overall KD effectiveness and amortizes the minimal additional training cost of the generic teacher across students in the pool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Shi, Gautam Gare, Jinjin Tian, Siqi Chai, Zhiqiu Lin, Arun Vasudevan, Di Feng, Francesco Ferroni, Shu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the challenge of predicting models' Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance using in-distribution (ID) measurements without requiring OOD data. Existing evaluations with "Effective Robustness", which use ID accuracy as an indicator of OOD accuracy, encounter limitations when models are trained with diverse supervision and distributions, such as class labels (Vision Models, VMs, on ImageNet) and textual descriptions (Visual-Language Models, VLMs, on LAION). VLMs often generalize better to OOD data than VMs despite having similar or lower ID performance. To improve the prediction of models' OOD performance from ID measurements, we introduce the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)-on-the-Line framework. This approach revisits the established concept of LCA distance, which measures the hierarchical distance between labels and predictions within a predefined class hierarchy, such as WordNet. We assess 75 models using ImageNet as the ID dataset and five significantly shifted OOD variants, uncovering a strong linear correlation between ID LCA distance and OOD top-1 accuracy. Our method provides a compelling alternative for understanding why VLMs tend to generalize better. Additionally, we propose a technique to construct a taxonomic hierarchy on any dataset using K-means clustering, demonstrating that LCA distance is robust to the constructed taxonomic hierarchy. Moreover, we demonstrate that aligning model predictions with class taxonomies, through soft labels or prompt engineering, can enhance model generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dorota Celi\'nska-Kopczy\'nska, Eryk Kopczy\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding suitable embeddings for connectomes (spatially embedded complex networks that map neural connections in the brain) is crucial for analyzing and understanding cognitive processes. Recent studies have found two-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings superior to Euclidean embeddings in modeling connectomes across species, especially human connectomes. However, those studies had limitations: geometries other than Euclidean, hyperbolic, or spherical were not considered. Following William Thurston's suggestion that the networks of neurons in the brain could be successfully represented in Solv geometry, we study the goodness-of-fit of the embeddings for 21 connectome networks (8 species). To this end, we suggest an embedding algorithm based on Simulating Annealing that allows us to embed connectomes to Euclidean, Spherical, Hyperbolic, Solv, Nil, and product geometries. Our algorithm tends to find better embeddings than the state-of-the-art, even in the hyperbolic case. Our findings suggest that while three-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings yield the best results in many cases, Solv embeddings perform reasonably well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Redha Taguelmimt, Samir Aknine, Djamila Boukredera, Narayan Changder, Tuomas Sandholm</p>
<p>Abstract: Coalition formation is a key capability in multi-agent systems. An important problem in coalition formation is coalition structure generation: partitioning agents into coalitions to optimize the social welfare. This is a challenging problem that has been the subject of active research for the past three decades. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SMART, for the problem based on a hybridization of three innovative techniques. Two of these techniques are based on dynamic programming, where we show a powerful connection between the coalitions selected for evaluation and the performance of the algorithms. These algorithms use offline phases to optimize the choice of coalitions to evaluate. The third one uses branch-and-bound and integer partition graph search to explore the solution space. Our techniques bring a new way of approaching the problem and a new level of precision to the field. In experiments over several common value distributions, we show that the hybridization of these techniques in SMART is faster than the fastest prior algorithms (ODP-IP, BOSS) in generating optimal solutions across all the value distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukio Ohsawa, Dingming Xue, Kaira Sekiguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: The senses of words evolve. The sense of the same word may change from today to tomorrow, and multiple senses of the same word may be the result of the evolution of each other, that is, they may be parents and children. If we view Juba as an evolving ecosystem, the paradigm of learning the correct answer, which does not move with the sense of a word, is no longer valid. This paper is a case study that shows that word polysemy is an evolutionary consequence of the modification of Semantic Cells, which has al-ready been presented by the author, by introducing a small amount of diversity in its initial state as an example of analyzing the current set of short sentences. In particular, the analysis of a sentence sequence of 1000 sentences in some order for each of the four senses of the word Spring, collected using Chat GPT, shows that the word acquires the most polysemy monotonically in the analysis when the senses are arranged in the order in which they have evolved. In other words, we present a method for analyzing the dynamism of a word's acquiring polysemy with evolution and, at the same time, a methodology for viewing polysemy from an evolutionary framework rather than a learning-based one.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Li, Yang Liu, Chuan Zhou, Xuanwu Liu, Xuming Pan, Buqing Cao, Xindong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of the sharing economy has gained broad recognition, and within this context, Sharing E-Bike Battery (SEB) have emerged as a focal point of societal interest. Despite the popularity, a notable discrepancy remains between user expectations regarding the remaining battery range of SEBs and the reality, leading to a pronounced inclination among users to find an available SEB during emergency situations. In response to this challenge, the integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and battery-swap services has surfaced as a viable solution. In this paper, we propose a novel structural Transformer-based model, referred to as the SEB-Transformer, designed specifically for predicting the battery range of SEBs. The scenario is conceptualized as a dynamic heterogeneous graph that encapsulates the interactions between users and bicycles, providing a comprehensive framework for analysis. Furthermore, we incorporate the graph structure into the SEB-Transformer to facilitate the estimation of the remaining e-bike battery range, in conjunction with mean structural similarity, enhancing the prediction accuracy. By employing the predictions made by our model, we are able to dynamically adjust the optimal cycling routes for users in real-time, while also considering the strategic locations of charging stations, thereby optimizing the user experience. Empirically our results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model against nine competitive baselines. These innovations, powered by AIoT, not only bridge the gap between user expectations and the physical limitations of battery range but also significantly improve the operational efficiency and sustainability of SEB services. Through these advancements, the shared electric bicycle ecosystem is evolving, making strides towards a more reliable, user-friendly, and sustainable mode of transportation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atul Kumar, Siddharth Garg, Soumya Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has recently resulted in their application to challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, understanding factors like prediction quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights aid application scientists in making informed decisions. However, DNNs lack inherent mechanisms to measure prediction uncertainty, prompting the creation of distinct frameworks for constructing robust uncertainty-aware models tailored to various visualization tasks. In this work, we develop uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model steady-state vector fields effectively. We comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, aimed at enabling uncertainty-informed visual analysis of features within steady vector field data. Our detailed exploration using several vector data sets indicate that uncertainty-aware models generate informative visualization results of vector field features. Furthermore, incorporating prediction uncertainty improves the resilience and interpretability of our DNN model, rendering it applicable for the analysis of non-trivial vector field data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Xiaobin Tian, Zequn Sun, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) completion models learn embeddings to predict missing facts. Recent works attempt to complete KGs in a text-generation manner with large language models (LLMs). However, they need to ground the output of LLMs to KG entities, which inevitably brings errors. In this paper, we present a finetuning framework, DIFT, aiming to unleash the KG completion ability of LLMs and avoid grounding errors. Given an incomplete fact, DIFT employs a lightweight model to obtain candidate entities and finetunes an LLM with discrimination instructions to select the correct one from the given candidates. To improve performance while reducing instruction data, DIFT uses a truncated sampling method to select useful facts for finetuning and injects KG embeddings into the LLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanwu Yang, Hairui Chen, Jiesi Hu, Xutao Guo, Ting Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have shifted the development of brain imaging analysis. However, several challenges remain, such as heterogeneity, individual variations, and the contradiction between the high dimensionality and small size of brain imaging datasets. These issues complicate the learning process, preventing models from capturing intrinsic, meaningful patterns and potentially leading to suboptimal performance due to biases and overfitting. Curriculum learning (CL) presents a promising solution by organizing training examples from simple to complex, mimicking the human learning process, and potentially fostering the development of more robust and accurate models. Despite its potential, the inherent limitations posed by small initial training datasets present significant challenges, including overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Progressive Self-Paced Distillation (PSPD) framework, employing an adaptive and progressive pacing and distillation mechanism. This allows for dynamic curriculum adjustments based on the states of both past and present models. The past model serves as a teacher, guiding the current model with gradually refined curriculum knowledge and helping prevent the loss of previously acquired knowledge. We validate PSPD's efficacy and adaptability across various convolutional neural networks using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, underscoring its superiority in enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. The source code for this approach will be released at https://github.com/Hrychen7/PSPD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal object detection offers a promising prospect to facilitate robust detection in various visual conditions. However, existing two-stream backbone networks are challenged by complex fusion and substantial parameter increments. This is primarily due to large data distribution biases of multimodal homogeneous information. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal object detector, named Low-rank Modal Adaptors (LMA) with a shared backbone. The shared parameters enhance the consistency of homogeneous information, while lightweight modal adaptors focus on modality unique features. Furthermore, we design an adaptive rank allocation strategy to adapt to the varying heterogeneity at different feature levels. When applied to two multimodal object detection datasets, experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, on DroneVehicle, LMA attains a 10.4% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art method with a 149M-parameters reduction. The code is available at https://github.com/zyszxhy/FoRA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renming Huang, Yunqiang Pei, Guoqing Wang, Yangming Zhang, Yang Yang, Peng Wang, Hengtao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong competitiveness in offline reinforcement learning tasks by formulating decision-making as sequential generation. However, the practicality of these methods is limited due to the lengthy inference processes they require. In this paper, we address this problem by decomposing the sampling process of diffusion models into two decoupled subprocesses: 1) generating a feasible trajectory, which is a time-consuming process, and 2) optimizing the trajectory. With this decomposition approach, we are able to partially separate efficiency and quality factors, enabling us to simultaneously gain efficiency advantages and ensure quality assurance. We propose the Trajectory Diffuser, which utilizes a faster autoregressive model to handle the generation of feasible trajectories while retaining the trajectory optimization process of diffusion models. This allows us to achieve more efficient planning without sacrificing capability. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Trajectory Diffuser, we conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves $\it 3$-$\it 10 \times$ faster inference speed compared to previous sequence modeling methods, while also outperforming them in terms of overall performance. https://github.com/RenMing-Huang/TrajectoryDiffuser

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Gu, Yihao Zhong, Shizun Li, Changsong Wei, Liting Dong, Zhuoyue Wang, Chao Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The stock market's ascent typically mirrors the flourishing state of the economy, whereas its decline is often an indicator of an economic downturn. Therefore, for a long time, significant correlation elements for predicting trends in financial stock markets have been widely discussed, and people are becoming increasingly interested in the task of financial text mining. The inherent instability of stock prices makes them acutely responsive to fluctuations within the financial markets. In this article, we use deep learning networks, based on the history of stock prices and articles of financial, business, technical news that introduce market information to predict stock prices. We illustrate the enhancement of predictive precision by integrating weighted news categories into the forecasting model. We developed a pre-trained NLP model known as FinBERT, designed to discern the sentiments within financial texts. Subsequently, we advanced this model by incorporating the sophisticated Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, thus constructing the innovative FinBERT-LSTM model. This model utilizes news categories related to the stock market structure hierarchy, namely market, industry, and stock related news categories, combined with the stock market's stock price situation in the previous week for prediction. We selected NASDAQ-100 index stock data and trained the model on Benzinga news articles, and utilized Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Accuracy as the key metrics for the assessment and comparative analysis of the model's performance. The results indicate that FinBERT-LSTM performs the best, followed by LSTM, and DNN model ranks third in terms of effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The privacy-preserving approaches to machine learning (ML) models have made substantial progress in recent years. However, it is still opaque in which circumstances and conditions the model becomes privacy-vulnerable, leading to a challenge for ML models to maintain both performance and privacy. In this paper, we first explore the disparity between member and non-member data in the representation of models under common training frameworks. We identify how the representation magnitude disparity correlates with privacy vulnerability and address how this correlation impacts privacy vulnerability. Based on the observations, we propose Saturn Ring Classifier Module (SRCM), a plug-in model-level solution to mitigate membership privacy leakage. Through a confined yet effective representation space, our approach ameliorates models' privacy vulnerability while maintaining generalizability.

<p>Abstract: Recent Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) methods rely on complete visual and audio input to answer questions accurately. However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as device malfunctions and data transmission errors frequently result in missing audio or visual modality. In such cases, existing AVQA methods suffer significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a framework that ensures robust AVQA performance even when a modality is missing. First, we propose a Relation-aware Missing Modal (RMM) generator with Relation-aware Missing Modal Recalling (RMMR) loss to enhance the ability of the generator to recall missing modal information by understanding the relationships and context among the available modalities. Second, we design an Audio-Visual Relation-aware (AVR) diffusion model with Audio-Visual Enhancing (AVE) loss to further enhance audio-visual features by leveraging the relationships and shared cues between the audio-visual modalities. As a result, our method can provide accurate answers by effectively utilizing available information even when input modalities are missing. We believe our method holds potential applications not only in AVQA research but also in various multi-modal scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroyuki Tokunaga, Joel Nicholls, Daria Vazhenina, Atsunori Kanemura</p>
<p>Abstract: By quantizing network weights and activations to low bitwidth, we can obtain hardware-friendly and energy-efficient networks. However, existing quantization techniques utilizing the straight-through estimator and piecewise constant functions face the issue of how to represent originally high-bit input data with low-bit values. To fully quantize deep neural networks, we propose pixel embedding, which replaces each float-valued input pixel with a vector of quantized values by using a lookup table. The lookup table or low-bit representation of pixels is differentiable and trainable by backpropagation. Such replacement of inputs with vectors is similar to word embedding in the natural language processing field. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 show that pixel embedding reduces the top-5 error gap caused by quantizing the floating points at the first layer to only 1% for the ImageNet dataset, and the top-1 error gap caused by quantizing first and last layers to slightly over 1% for the CIFAR-100 dataset. The usefulness of pixel embedding is further demonstrated by inference time measurements, which demonstrate over 1.7 times speedup compared to floating point precision first layer.</p>

What is preventing us from achieving this? Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance on challenging robotics tasks, but requires substantial human effort to set up the task in a way that is amenable to RL. It's our position that algorithmic improvements in policy optimization and other ideas should be guided towards resolving the primary bottleneck of shaping the training environment, i.e., designing observations, actions, rewards and simulation dynamics. Most practitioners don't tune the RL algorithm, but other environment parameters to obtain a desirable controller. We posit that scaling RL to diverse robotic tasks will only be achieved if the community focuses on automating environment shaping procedures.</p>

<p>Abstract: With advancements in data availability and computing resources, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased capabilities across various fields. However, the quadratic complexity of the vision encoder in MLLMs constrains the resolution of input images. Most current approaches mitigate this issue by cropping high-resolution images into smaller sub-images, which are then processed independently by the vision encoder. Despite capturing sufficient local details, these sub-images lack global context and fail to interact with one another. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MLLM, INF-LLaVA, designed for effective high-resolution image perception. INF-LLaVA incorporates two innovative components. First, we introduce a Dual-perspective Cropping Module (DCM), which ensures that each sub-image contains continuous details from a local perspective and comprehensive information from a global perspective. Second, we introduce Dual-perspective Enhancement Module (DEM) to enable the mutual enhancement of global and local features, allowing INF-LLaVA to effectively process high-resolution images by simultaneously capturing detailed local information and comprehensive global context. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of these components, and experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that INF-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLMs. Code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/WeihuangLin/INF-LLaVA.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these models still have numerous security vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. Therefore, by investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and guide us in developing more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analysis-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and 1.06 Attack Efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.</p>

<p>Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security challenges and potential risks to society, necessitating extensive efforts in automated vulnerability detection. There are two popular lines of work to address automated vulnerability detection. On one hand, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is usually utilized to scan source code for security vulnerabilities, especially in industries. On the other hand, deep learning (DL)-based methods, especially since the introduction of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated their potential in software vulnerability detection. However, there is no comparative study between SAST tools and LLMs, aiming to determine their effectiveness in vulnerability detection, understand the pros and cons of both SAST and LLMs, and explore the potential combination of these two families of approaches.
  In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages: Java, C, and Python. The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives. By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent. Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have illuminated that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial potential in the realm of RTL (Register Transfer Level) code generation, with notable advancements evidenced by commercial models such as GPT-4 and Claude3-Opus. Despite their proficiency, these commercial LLMs often raise concerns regarding privacy and security. Conversely, open-source LLMs, which offer solutions to these concerns, have inferior performance in RTL code generation tasks to commercial models due to the lack of highquality open-source RTL datasets. To address this issue, we introduce OriGen, a fully open-source framework featuring self-reflection capabilities and a dataset augmentation methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code. We propose a novel code-to-code augmentation methodology that leverages knowledge distillation to enhance the quality of the open-source RTL code datasets. Additionally, OriGen is capable of correcting syntactic errors by leveraging a self-reflection process based on feedback from the compiler. The self-reflection ability of the model is facilitated by a carefully constructed dataset, which comprises a comprehensive collection of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen remarkably outperforms other open-source alternatives in RTL code generation, surpassing the previous best-performing LLM by 9.8% on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark. Furthermore, OriGen exhibits superior capabilities in self-reflection and error rectification, surpassing GPT-4 by 18.1% on the benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of self-reflection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyi Ouyang, Hongyi Wang, Ziwei Niu, Zhenjia Bai, Shiao Xie, Yingying Xu, Ruofeng Tong, Yen-Wei Chen, Lanfen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of multi-label image classification involves recognizing multiple objects within a single image. Considering both valuable semantic information contained in the labels and essential visual features presented in the image, tight visual-linguistic interactions play a vital role in improving classification performance. Moreover, given the potential variance in object size and appearance within a single image, attention to features of different scales can help to discover possible objects in the image. Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved great success in multi-label image classification by leveraging the advantage of modeling long-range dependencies, but they have several limitations. Firstly, existing methods treat visual feature extraction and cross-modal fusion as separate steps, resulting in insufficient visual-linguistic alignment in the joint semantic space. Additionally, they only extract visual features and perform cross-modal fusion at a single scale, neglecting objects with different characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Scale-Aware Vision-Language Transformer (HSVLT) with two appealing designs: (1)~A hierarchical multi-scale architecture that involves a Cross-Scale Aggregation module, which leverages joint multi-modal features extracted from multiple scales to recognize objects of varying sizes and appearances in images. (2)~Interactive Visual-Linguistic Attention, a novel attention mechanism module that tightly integrates cross-modal interaction, enabling the joint updating of visual, linguistic and multi-modal features. We have evaluated our method on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that HSVLT surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyun Sun, Chengxiao Dai, Zhongze Luo, Yangbo Chang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial potential in delivering legal consultation services to users without a legal background, attributed to their superior text comprehension and generation capabilities. Nonetheless, existing Chinese legal LLMs limit interaction to a single model-user dialogue, unlike the collaborative consultations typical of law firms, where multiple staff members contribute to a single consultation. This limitation prevents an authentic consultation experience. Additionally, extant Chinese legal LLMs suffer from critical limitations: (1) insufficient control over the quality of instruction fine-tuning data; (2) increased model hallucination resulting from users' ambiguous queries; and (3) a reduction in the model's ability to follow instructions over multiple dialogue turns. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel legal dialogue framework that leverages the collaborative capabilities of multiple LLM agents, termed LawLuo. This framework encompasses four agents: a receptionist, a lawyer, a secretary, and a boss, each responsible for different functionalities, collaboratively providing a comprehensive legal consultation to users. Additionally, we constructed two high-quality legal dialogue datasets, KINLED and MURLED, and fine-tuned ChatGLM-3-6b using these datasets. We propose a legal query clarification algorithm called ToLC. Experimental results demonstrate that LawLuo outperforms baseline LLMs, including GPT-4, across three dimensions: lawyer-like language style, the usefulness of legal advice, and the accuracy of legal knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyang Sun, Xi Chen, Xiumei Wang, Dandan Zhu, Xingping Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-Abelian braiding has attracted substantial attention because of its pivotal role in describing the exchange behaviour of anyons, in which the input and outcome of non-Abelian braiding are connected by a unitary matrix. Implementing braiding in a classical system can assist the experimental investigation of non-Abelian physics. However, the design of non-Abelian gauge fields faces numerous challenges stemmed from the intricate interplay of group structures, Lie algebra properties, representation theory, topology, and symmetry breaking. The extreme diversity makes it a powerful tool for the study of condensed matter physics. Whereas the widely used artificial intelligence with data-driven approaches has greatly promoted the development of physics, most works are limited on the data-to-data design. Here we propose a self-reasoning assistant learning framework capable of directly generating non-Abelian gauge fields. This framework utilizes the forward diffusion process to capture and reproduce the complex patterns and details inherent in the target distribution through continuous transformation. Then the reverse diffusion process is used to make the generated data closer to the distribution of the original situation. Thus, it owns strong self-reasoning capabilities, allowing to automatically discover the feature representation and capture more subtle relationships from the dataset. Moreover, the self-reasoning eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and simplifies the process of model building. Our framework offers a disruptive paradigm shift to parse complex physical processes, automatically uncovering patterns from massive datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebwar Khalid Muhammed, Ribwar Rashid Aziz, Alla Ahmad Hassan, Aso Mohammed Aladdin, Shaida Jumaah Saydah, Tarik Ahmed. Rashid, Bryar Ahmad Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, cybersecurity has grown into a more significant and difficult scientific issue. The recog-nition of threats and attacks meant for knowledge and safety on the internet is growing harder to detect. Since cybersecurity guarantees the privacy and security of data sent via the Internet, it is essential, while also providing protection against malicious attacks. Encrypt has grown into an an-swer that has become an essential element of information security systems. To ensure the security of shared data, including text, images, or videos, it is essential to employ various methods and strategies. This study delves into the prevalent cryptographic methods and algorithms utilized for prevention and stream encryption, examining their encoding techniques such as advanced encryp-tion standard (AES), Blowfish, Twofish, Salsa20, and ChaCha20. The primary objective of this re-search is to identify the optimal times and throughputs (speeds) for data encryption and decryption processes. The methodology of this study involved selecting five distinct types of images to com-pare the outcomes of the techniques evaluated in this research. The assessment focused on pro-cessing time and speed parameters, examining visual encoding and decoding using Java as the pri-mary platform. A comparative analysis of several symmetric key ciphers was performed, focusing on handling large datasets. Despite this limitation, comparing different images helped evaluate the techniques' novelty. The results showed that ChaCha20 had the best average time for both encryp-tion and decryption, being over 50% faster than some other algorithms. However, the Twofish algo-rithm had lower throughput during testing. The paper concludes with findings and suggestions for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Xin Dong, Greg Heinrich, Thomas Breuel, Jan Kautz, David Krueger, Pavlo Molchanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only resource-intensive to train but even more costly to deploy in production. Therefore, recent work has attempted to prune blocks of LLMs based on cheap proxies for estimating block importance, effectively removing 10% of blocks in well-trained LLaMa-2 and Mistral 7b models without any significant degradation of downstream metrics. In this paper, we explore different block importance metrics by considering adaptive metrics such as Shapley value in addition to static ones explored in prior work. We show that adaptive metrics exhibit a trade-off in performance between tasks i.e., improvement on one task may degrade performance on the other due to differences in the computed block influences. Furthermore, we extend this analysis from a complete block to individual self-attention and feed-forward layers, highlighting the propensity of the self-attention layers to be more amendable to pruning, even allowing removal of upto 33% of the self-attention layers without incurring any performance degradation on MMLU for Mistral 7b (significant reduction in costly maintenance of KV-cache). Finally, we look at simple performance recovery techniques to emulate the pruned layers by training lightweight additive bias or low-rank linear adapters. Performance recovery using emulated updates avoids performance degradation for the initial blocks (up to 5% absolute improvement on MMLU), which is either competitive or superior to the learning-based technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hansol Kim, Hoyeol Choi, Youngjun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) for face recognition aggregates locally optimized models from individual clients to construct a generalized face recognition model. However, previous studies present two major challenges: insufficient incorporation of self-supervised learning and the necessity for clients to accommodate multiple subjects. To tackle these limitations, we propose FedFS (Federated Learning for personalized Face recognition via intra-subject Self-supervised learning framework), a novel federated learning architecture tailored to train personalized face recognition models without imposing subjects. Our proposed FedFS comprises two crucial components that leverage aggregated features of the local and global models to cooperate with representations of an off-the-shelf model. These components are (1) adaptive soft label construction, utilizing dot product operations to reformat labels within intra-instances, and (2) intra-subject self-supervised learning, employing cosine similarity operations to strengthen robust intra-subject representations. Additionally, we introduce a regularization loss to prevent overfitting and ensure the stability of the optimized model. To assess the effectiveness of FedFS, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the DigiFace-1M and VGGFace datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Avoiding systemic discrimination requires investigating AI models' potential to propagate stereotypes resulting from the inherent biases of training datasets. Our study investigated how text-to-image models unintentionally perpetuate non-rational beliefs regarding autism. The research protocol involved generating images based on 53 prompts aimed at visualizing concrete objects and abstract concepts related to autism across four models: DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and Midjourney (N=249). Expert assessment of results was performed via a framework of 10 deductive codes representing common stereotypes contested by the community regarding their presence and spatial intensity, quantified on ordinal scales and subject to statistical analysis of inter-rater reliability and size effects. The models frequently utilised controversial themes and symbols which were unevenly distributed, however, with striking homogeneity in terms of skin colour, gender, and age, with autistic individuals portrayed as engaged in solitary activities, interacting with objects rather than people, and displaying stereotypical emotional expressions such as pale, anger, or sad. Secondly we observed representational insensitivity regarding autism images despite directional prompting aimed at falsifying the above results. Additionally, DALL-E explicitly denied perpetuating stereotypes. We interpret this as ANNs mirroring the human cognitive architecture regarding the discrepancy between background and reflective knowledge, as justified by our previous research on autism-related stereotypes in humans.</p>

<p>Abstract: The escalating impacts of climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable development and natural resource management necessitate innovative technological solutions. Quantum computing (QC) has emerged as a promising tool with the potential to revolutionize these critical areas. This review explores the application of quantum machine learning and optimization techniques for climate change prediction and enhancing sustainable development. Traditional computational methods often fall short in handling the scale and complexity of climate models and natural resource management. Quantum advancements, however, offer significant improvements in computational efficiency and problem-solving capabilities. By synthesizing the latest research and developments, this paper highlights how QC and quantum machine learning can optimize multi-infrastructure systems towards climate neutrality. The paper also evaluates the performance of current quantum algorithms and hardware in practical applications and presents realistic cases, i.e., waste-to-energy in anaerobic digestion, disaster prevention in flooding prediction, and new material development for carbon capture. The integration of these quantum technologies promises to drive significant advancements in achieving climate resilience and sustainable development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many challenging tasks such as managing traffic systems, electricity grids, or supply chains involve complex decision-making processes that must balance multiple conflicting objectives and coordinate the actions of various independent decision-makers (DMs). One perspective for formalising and addressing such tasks is multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning (MOMARL). MOMARL broadens reinforcement learning (RL) to problems with multiple agents each needing to consider multiple objectives in their learning process. In reinforcement learning research, benchmarks are crucial in facilitating progress, evaluation, and reproducibility. The significance of benchmarks is underscored by the existence of numerous benchmark frameworks developed for various RL paradigms, including single-agent RL (e.g., Gymnasium), multi-agent RL (e.g., PettingZoo), and single-agent multi-objective RL (e.g., MO-Gymnasium). To support the advancement of the MOMARL field, we introduce MOMAland, the first collection of standardised environments for multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning. MOMAland addresses the need for comprehensive benchmarking in this emerging field, offering over 10 diverse environments that vary in the number of agents, state representations, reward structures, and utility considerations. To provide strong baselines for future research, MOMAland also includes algorithms capable of learning policies in such settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyoung Kim, Sihyeon Lee, Hyeon Jeon, Keon-Joo Lee, Hee-Joon Bae, Bohyoung Kim, Jinwook Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Acute stroke demands prompt diagnosis and treatment to achieve optimal patient outcomes. However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Huang, Jinghui Zhang, Xuwei Qian, Zhen Wu, Meng Wang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP. The code is released at https://github.com/wenbohuang1002/SOAP.</p>

<p>Abstract: The significance of modeling long-term user interests for CTR prediction tasks in large-scale recommendation systems is progressively gaining attention among researchers and practitioners. Existing work, such as SIM and TWIN, typically employs a two-stage approach to model long-term user behavior sequences for efficiency concerns. The first stage rapidly retrieves a subset of sequences related to the target item from a long sequence using a search-based mechanism namely the General Search Unit (GSU), while the second stage calculates the interest scores using the Exact Search Unit (ESU) on the retrieved results. Given the extensive length of user behavior sequences spanning the entire life cycle, potentially reaching up to 10^6 in scale, there is currently no effective solution for fully modeling such expansive user interests. To overcome this issue, we introduced TWIN-V2, an enhancement of TWIN, where a divide-and-conquer approach is applied to compress life-cycle behaviors and uncover more accurate and diverse user interests. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering method groups items with similar characteristics in life-cycle behaviors into a single cluster during the offline phase. By limiting the size of clusters, we can compress behavior sequences well beyond the magnitude of 10^5 to a length manageable for online inference in GSU retrieval. Cluster-aware target attention extracts comprehensive and multi-faceted long-term interests of users, thereby making the final recommendation results more accurate and diverse. Extensive offline experiments on a multi-billion-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of TWIN-V2. Under an efficient deployment framework, TWIN-V2 has been successfully deployed to the primary traffic that serves hundreds of millions of daily active users at Kuaishou.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are associated with various diseases, including cancer, infections, and neurodegenerative disorders. Obtaining three-dimensional structural information on these PPIs serves as a foundation to interfere with those or to guide drug design. Various strategies can be followed to model those complexes, all typically resulting in a large number of models.

To address this challenge, we previously developed DeepRank-GNN-esm, a graph-based deep learning algorithm for ranking modelled PPI structures harnessing the power of protein language models.

<p>Abstract: Statistical heterogeneity is a root cause of tension among accuracy, fairness, and robustness of federated learning (FL), and is key in paving a path forward. Personalized FL (PFL) is an approach that aims to reduce the impact of statistical heterogeneity by developing personalized models for individual users, while also inherently providing benefits in terms of fairness and robustness. However, existing PFL frameworks focus on improving the performance of personalized models while neglecting the global model. Moreover, these frameworks achieve sublinear convergence rates and rely on strong assumptions. In this paper, we propose FLAME, an optimization framework by utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to train personalized and global models. We propose a model selection strategy to improve performance in situations where clients have different types of heterogeneous data. Our theoretical analysis establishes the global convergence and two kinds of convergence rates for FLAME under mild assumptions. We theoretically demonstrate that FLAME is more robust and fair than the state-of-the-art methods on a class of linear problems. Our experimental findings show that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art methods in convergence and accuracy, and it achieves higher test accuracy under various attacks and performs more uniformly across clients.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embedded devices with neural network accelerators offer great versatility for their users, reducing the need to use cloud-based services. At the same time, they introduce new security challenges in the area of hardware attacks, the most prominent being side-channel analysis (SCA). It was shown that SCA can recover model parameters with a high accuracy, posing a threat to entities that wish to keep their models confidential. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of quantized models implemented in OpenVINO, an embedded framework for deploying neural networks on embedded and Edge devices. We show that it is possible to recover model parameters with high precision, allowing the recovered model to perform very close to the original one. Our experiments on GoogleNet v1 show only a 1% difference in the Top 1 and a 0.64% difference in the Top 5 accuracies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in massively multilingual machine translation systems have significantly enhanced translation accuracy; however, even the best performing systems still generate hallucinations, severely impacting user trust. Detecting hallucinations in Machine Translation (MT) remains a critical challenge, particularly since existing methods excel with High-Resource Languages (HRLs) but exhibit substantial limitations when applied to Low-Resource Languages (LRLs). This paper evaluates hallucination detection approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic similarity within massively multilingual embeddings. Our study spans 16 language directions, covering HRLs, LRLs, with diverse scripts. We find that the choice of model is essential for performance. On average, for HRLs, Llama3-70B outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 0.16 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient). However, for LRLs we observe that Claude Sonnet outperforms other LLMs on average by 0.03 MCC. The key takeaway from our study is that LLMs can achieve performance comparable or even better than previously proposed models, despite not being explicitly trained for any machine translation task. However, their advantage is less significant for LRLs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shapley Values are concepts established for eXplainable AI. They are used to explain black-box predictive models by quantifying the features' contributions to the model's outcomes. Since computing the exact Shapley Values is known to be computationally intractable on real-world datasets, neural estimators have emerged as alternative, more scalable approaches to get approximated Shapley Values estimates. However, experiments with neural estimators are currently hard to replicate as algorithm implementations, explainer evaluators, and results visualizations are neither standardized nor promptly usable. To bridge this gap, we present BONES, a new benchmark focused on neural estimation of Shapley Value. It provides researchers with a suite of state-of-the-art neural and traditional estimators, a set of commonly used benchmark datasets, ad hoc modules for training black-box models, as well as specific functions to easily compute the most popular evaluation metrics and visualize results. The purpose is to simplify XAI model usage, evaluation, and comparison. In this paper, we showcase BONES results and visualizations for XAI model benchmarking on both tabular and image data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baiyu Peng, Aude Billard</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning for a wide range of real-world tasks necessitates to know and write all constraints. However, instances exist where these constraints are either unknown or challenging to specify accurately. A possible solution is to infer the unknown constraints from expert demonstration. The majority of prior works limit themselves to learning simple linear constraints, or require strong knowledge of the true constraint parameterization or environmental model. To mitigate these problems, this paper presents a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning approach to infer a continuous, arbitrary and possibly nonlinear, constraint from demonstration. From a PU learning view, We treat all data in demonstrations as positive (feasible) data, and learn a (sub)-optimal policy to generate high-reward-winning but potentially infeasible trajectories, which serve as unlabeled data containing both feasible and infeasible states. Under an assumption on data distribution, a feasible-infeasible classifier (i.e., constraint model) is learned from the two datasets through a postprocessing PU learning technique. The entire method employs an iterative framework alternating between updating the policy, which generates and selects higher-reward policies, and updating the constraint model. Additionally, a memory buffer is introduced to record and reuse samples from previous iterations to prevent forgetting. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in two Mujoco environments, successfully inferring continuous nonlinear constraints and outperforming a baseline method in terms of constraint accuracy and policy safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miriam Fahimi, Mayra Russo, Kristen M. Scott, Maria-Esther Vidal, Bettina Berendt, Katharina Kinder-Kurlanda</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of fair AI aims to counter biased algorithms through computational modelling. However, it faces increasing criticism for perpetuating the use of overly technical and reductionist methods. As a result, novel approaches appear in the field to address more socially-oriented and interdisciplinary (SOI) perspectives on fair AI. In this paper, we take this dynamic as the starting point to study the tension between computer science (CS) and SOI research. By drawing on STS and CSCW theory, we position fair AI research as a matter of 'organizational alignment': what makes research 'doable' is the successful alignment of three levels of work organization (the social world, the laboratory and the experiment). Based on qualitative interviews with CS researchers, we analyze the tasks, resources, and actors required for doable research in the case of fair AI. We find that CS researchers engage with SOI to some extent, but organizational conditions, articulation work, and ambiguities of the social world constrain the doability of SOI research. Based on our findings, we identify and discuss problems for aligning CS and SOI as fair AI continues to evolve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Habib Hajimolahoseini, Walid Ahmed, Austin Wen, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study and propose several novel techniques for implementing 3D convolutional blocks using 2D and/or 1D convolutions with only 4D and/or 3D tensors. Our motivation is that 3D convolutions with 5D tensors are computationally very expensive and they may not be supported by some of the edge devices used in real-time applications such as robots. The existing approaches mitigate this by splitting the 3D kernels into spatial and temporal domains, but they still use 3D convolutions with 5D tensors in their implementations. We resolve this issue by introducing some appropriate 4D/3D tensor reshaping as well as new combination techniques for spatial and temporal splits. The proposed implementation methods show significant improvement both in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results confirm that the proposed spatio-temporal processing structure outperforms the original model in terms of speed and accuracy using only 4D tensors with fewer parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aristeidis Panos, Rahaf Aljundi, Daniel Olmeda Reino, Richard E Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in visual question answering and image captioning, acting as a crucial link between visual and language models. However, existing open-source VLMs heavily rely on pretrained and frozen vision encoders (such as CLIP). Despite CLIP's robustness across diverse domains, it still exhibits non-negligible image understanding errors. These errors propagate to the VLM responses, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In our work, we propose an efficient and robust method for updating vision encoders within VLMs. Our approach selectively and locally updates encoders, leading to substantial performance improvements on data where previous mistakes occurred, while maintaining overall robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method during continual few-shot updates. Theoretical grounding, generality, and computational efficiency characterize our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asankhaya Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Patched Round-Trip Correctness (Patched RTC), a novel evaluation technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to diverse software development tasks, particularly focusing on "outer loop" activities such as bug fixing, code review, and documentation updates. Patched RTC extends the original Round-Trip Correctness method to work with any LLM and downstream task, offering a self-evaluating framework that measures consistency and robustness of model responses without human intervention. The study demonstrates a correlation between Patched RTC scores and task-specific accuracy metrics, presenting it as an alternative to the LLM-as-Judge paradigm for open-domain task evaluation. We implement Patched RTC in an open-source framework called patchwork, allowing for transparent evaluation during inference across various patchflows. Experiments comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models across different software development tasks reveal that Patched RTC effectively distinguishes model performance and task difficulty. The paper also explores the impact of consistency prompts on improving model accuracy, suggesting that Patched RTC can guide prompt refinement and model selection for complex software development workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang-Duo Tsai, Shih-Lun Wu, Haven Kim, Bo-Yu Chen, Hao-Chung Cheng, Yi-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-music models allow users to generate nearly realistic musical audio with textual commands. However, editing music audios remains challenging due to the conflicting desiderata of performing fine-grained alterations on the audio while maintaining a simple user interface. To address this challenge, we propose Audio Prompt Adapter (or AP-Adapter), a lightweight addition to pretrained text-to-music models. We utilize AudioMAE to extract features from the input audio, and construct attention-based adapters to feedthese features into the internal layers of AudioLDM2, a diffusion-based text-to-music model. With 22M trainable parameters, AP-Adapter empowers users to harness both global (e.g., genre and timbre) and local (e.g., melody) aspects of music, using the original audio and a short text as inputs. Through objective and subjective studies, we evaluate AP-Adapter on three tasks: timbre transfer, genre transfer, and accompaniment generation. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness on out-of-domain audios containing unseen instruments during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Luo, Yi Zhou Zhengren Wang, Mingyu Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: A $k$-defective clique of an undirected graph $G$ is a subset of its vertices that induces a nearly complete graph with a maximum of $k$ missing edges. The maximum $k$-defective clique problem, which asks for the largest $k$-defective clique from the given graph, is important in many applications, such as social and biological network analysis. In the paper, we propose a new branching algorithm that takes advantage of the structural properties of the $k$-defective clique and uses the efficient maximum clique algorithm as a subroutine. As a result, the algorithm has a better asymptotic running time than the existing ones. We also investigate upper-bounding techniques and propose a new upper bound utilizing the \textit{conflict relationship} between vertex pairs. Because conflict relationship is common in many graph problems, we believe that this technique can be potentially generalized. Finally, experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on a wide range of open benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgos Lysandrou, Roma English Owen, Vanja Popovic, Grant Le Brun, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Beatrice Alex, Elizabeth A. L. Fairley</p>
<p>Abstract: There exists an invisible barrier between healthcare professionals' perception of a patient's clinical experience and the reality. This barrier may be induced by the environment that hinders patients from sharing their experiences openly with healthcare professionals. As patients are observed to discuss and exchange knowledge more candidly on social media, valuable insights can be leveraged from these platforms. However, the abundance of non-patient posts on social media necessitates filtering out such irrelevant content to distinguish the genuine voices of patients, a task we refer to as patient voice classification. In this study, we analyse the importance of linguistic characteristics in accurately classifying patient voices. Our findings underscore the essential role of linguistic and statistical text similarity analysis in identifying common patterns among patient groups. These results allude to even starker differences in the way patients express themselves at a disease level and across various therapeutic domains. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Language Model on the combined datasets with similar linguistic patterns, resulting in a highly accurate automatic patient voice classification. Being the pioneering study on the topic, our focus on extracting authentic patient experiences from social media stands as a crucial step towards advancing healthcare standards and fostering a patient-centric approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erica Coppolillo, Simone Mungari, Ettore Ritacco, Giuseppe Manco</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of realistic datasets poses a significant challenge in benchmarking recommender systems and social network analysis methods and techniques. A common and effective solution is to generate synthetic data that simulates realistic interactions. However, although various methods have been proposed, the existing literature still lacks generators that are fully adaptable and allow easy manipulation of the underlying data distributions and structural properties. To address this issue, the present work introduces GenRec, a novel framework for generating synthetic user-item interactions that exhibit realistic and well-known properties observed in recommendation scenarios. The framework is based on a stochastic generative process based on latent factor modeling. Here, the latent factors can be exploited to yield long-tailed preference distributions, and at the same time they characterize subpopulations of users and topic-based item clusters. Notably, the proposed framework is highly flexible and offers a wide range of hyper-parameters for customizing the generation of user-item interactions. The code used to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GenRec-DED3.</p>

Leveraging duality, we propose a momentum-based PMD update. By taking the functional route, our approach is independent of the policy parametrization and applicable to large-scale optimization, covering previous applications of momentum at the level of policy parameters as a special case. We theoretically analyze several properties of this approach and complement with a numerical ablation study, which serves to illustrate the policy optimization dynamics on the value polytope, relative to different algorithmic design choices in this space. We further characterize numerically several features of the problem setting relevant for functional acceleration, and lastly, we investigate the impact of approximation on their learning mechanics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniela L. Ramos, Hector J. Hortua</p>
<p>Abstract: Colorectal polyps are generally benign alterations that, if not identified promptly and managed successfully, can progress to cancer and cause affectations on the colon mucosa, known as adenocarcinoma. Today advances in Deep Learning have demonstrated the ability to achieve significant performance in image classification and detection in medical diagnosis applications. Nevertheless, these models are prone to overfitting, and making decisions based only on point estimations may provide incorrect predictions. Thus, to obtain a more informed decision, we must consider point estimations along with their reliable uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we built different Bayesian neural network approaches based on the flexibility of posterior distribution to develop semantic segmentation of colorectal polyp images. We found that these models not only provide state-of-the-art performance on the segmentation of this medical dataset but also, yield accurate uncertainty estimates. We applied multiplicative normalized flows(MNF) and reparameterization trick on the UNET, FPN, and LINKNET architectures tested with multiple backbones in deterministic and Bayesian versions. We report that the FPN + EfficientnetB7 architecture with MNF is the most promising option given its IOU of 0.94 and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.004, combined with its superiority in identifying difficult-to-detect colorectal polyps, which is effective in clinical areas where early detection prevents the development of colon cancer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning is the problem of integrating new information in a model while retaining the knowledge acquired in the past. Despite the tangible improvements achieved in recent years, the problem of continual learning is still an open one. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind the successes and failures of existing continual learning algorithms can unlock the development of new successful strategies. In this work, we view continual learning from the perspective of the multi-task loss approximation, and we compare two alternative strategies, namely local and global approximations. We classify existing continual learning algorithms based on the approximation used, and we assess the practical effects of this distinction in common continual learning settings.Additionally, we study optimal continual learning objectives in the case of local polynomial approximations and we provide examples of existing algorithms implementing the optimal objectives</p>

<p>Abstract: It is prevalent in contemporary AI and robotics to separately postulate a brain modeled by neural networks and employ it to learn intelligent and adaptive behavior. While this method has worked very well for many types of tasks, it isn't the only type of intelligence that exists in nature. In this work, we study the ways in which intelligent behavior can be created without a separate and explicit brain for robot control, but rather solely as a result of the computation occurring within the physical body of a robot. Specifically, we show that adaptive and complex behavior can be created in voxel-based virtual soft robots by using simple reactive materials that actively change the shape of the robot, and thus its behavior, under different environmental cues. We demonstrate a proof of concept for the idea of closed-loop morphological computation, and show that in our implementation, it enables behavior mimicking logic gates, enabling us to demonstrate how such behaviors may be combined to build up more complex collective behaviors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Annotation and classification of legal text are central components of empirical legal research. Traditionally, these tasks are often delegated to trained research assistants. Motivated by the advances in language modeling, empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to prompting commercial models, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation. Despite growing use, our understanding of how to best utilize large language models for legal tasks remains limited. We conduct a comprehensive study of 260 legal text classification tasks, nearly all new to the machine learning community. Starting from GPT-4 as a baseline, we show that it has non-trivial but highly varied zero-shot accuracy, often exhibiting performance that may be insufficient for legal work. We then demonstrate that a lightly fine-tuned Llama 3 model vastly outperforms GPT-4 on almost all tasks, typically by double-digit percentage points. We find that larger models respond better to fine-tuning than smaller models. A few tens to hundreds of examples suffice to achieve high classification accuracy. Notably, we can fine-tune a single model on all 260 tasks simultaneously at a small loss in accuracy relative to having a separate model for each task. Our work points to a viable alternative to the predominant practice of prompting commercial models. For concrete legal tasks with some available labeled data, researchers are better off using a fine-tuned open-source model.</p>

This brief note examines the relevance of the latent space in these autoencoders. We consider the relationship between the dimensionality of these autoencoders and the complexity of the information being encoded. We discuss how observed differences between species in their connectome could be linked to their cognitive capacities. Finally, we link this analysis with a basic but often overlooked fact: human cognition is likely limited by our own brain structure. However, this limitation does not apply to machine learning systems, and we should be aware of the need to learn how to exploit this augmented vision of the nature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven deep learning models have shown great capabilities to assist radiologists in breast ultrasound (US) diagnoses. However, their effectiveness is limited by the long-tail distribution of training data, which leads to inaccuracies in rare cases. In this study, we address a long-standing challenge of improving the diagnostic model performance on rare cases using long-tailed data. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline, TAILOR, that builds a knowledge-driven generative model to produce tailored synthetic data. The generative model, using 3,749 lesions as source data, can generate millions of breast-US images, especially for error-prone rare cases. The generated data can be further used to build a diagnostic model for accurate and interpretable diagnoses. In the prospective external evaluation, our diagnostic model outperforms the average performance of nine radiologists by 33.5% in specificity with the same sensitivity, improving their performance by providing predictions with an interpretable decision-making process. Moreover, on ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), our diagnostic model outperforms all radiologists by a large margin, with only 34 DCIS lesions in the source data. We believe that TAILOR can potentially be extended to various diseases and imaging modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of \textbf{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the \textsc{C$^2$-Eval} benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create \textsc{C$^2$-Syn}, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B}, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperbolic embeddings are a class of representation learning methods that offer competitive performances when data can be abstracted as a tree-like graph. However, in practice, learning hyperbolic embeddings of hierarchical data is difficult due to the different geometry between hyperbolic space and the Euclidean space. To address such difficulties, we first categorize three kinds of illness that harm the performance of the embeddings. Then, we develop a geometry-aware algorithm using a dilation operation and a transitive closure regularization to tackle these illnesses. We empirically validate these techniques and present a theoretical analysis of the mechanism behind the dilation operation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal superior performances of our algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khadija Iddrisu, Waseem Shariff, Suzanne Little</p>
<p>Abstract: Saccades are extremely rapid movements of both eyes that occur simultaneously, typically observed when an individual shifts their focus from one object to another. These movements are among the swiftest produced by humans and possess the potential to achieve velocities greater than that of blinks. The peak angular speed of the eye during a saccade can reach as high as 700{\deg}/s in humans, especially during larger saccades that cover a visual angle of 25{\deg}. Previous research has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in comprehending neurological conditions through the study of saccades. A necessary step in saccade detection involves accurately identifying the precise location of the pupil within the eye, from which additional information such as gaze angles can be inferred. Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with the high temporal precision necessary for tracking very fast movements, resulting in motion blur and latency issues. Event cameras, on the other hand, offer a promising alternative by recording changes in the visual scene asynchronously and providing high temporal resolution and low latency. By bridging the gap between traditional computer vision and event-based vision, we present events as frames that can be readily utilized by standard deep learning algorithms. This approach harnesses YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection technology, to process these frames for pupil tracking using the publicly accessible Ev-Eye dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, highlighting its potential applications in neuroscience, ophthalmology, and human-computer interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyu Xu, Wenhui Zhang, Zhibo Wang, Feng Xiao, Rui Zheng, Yunhe Feng, Zhongjie Ba, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot. These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats. Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. To identify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM. However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to different scenarios. To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextual feedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times. Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently. By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts towards applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of these real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability. We have reported all found issues and communicated with OpenAI and Meta for bug fixes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runpeng Yu, Weihao Yu, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method. Instead, it offers a fairer and more comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models across various tasks, including machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, natural language processing, and symbolic formula representation. Specifically, we control the number of parameters and FLOPs to compare the performance of KAN and MLP. Our main observation is that, except for symbolic formula representation tasks, MLP generally outperforms KAN. We also conduct ablation studies on KAN and find that its advantage in symbolic formula representation mainly stems from its B-spline activation function. When B-spline is applied to MLP, performance in symbolic formula representation significantly improves, surpassing or matching that of KAN. However, in other tasks where MLP already excels over KAN, B-spline does not substantially enhance MLP's performance. Furthermore, we find that KAN's forgetting issue is more severe than that of MLP in a standard class-incremental continual learning setting, which differs from the findings reported in the KAN paper. We hope these results provide insights for future research on KAN and other MLP alternatives. Project link: https://github.com/yu-rp/KANbeFair</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16695">Stress-Testing Long-Context Language Models with Lifelong ICL and Task Haystack</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyue Xu, Qinyuan Ye, Xiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Lifelong ICL, a problem setting that challenges long-context language models (LMs) to learn from a sequence of language tasks through in-context learning (ICL). We further introduce Task Haystack, an evaluation suite dedicated to assessing and diagnosing how long-context LMs utilizes contexts in Lifelong ICL. When given a task instruction and test inputs, long-context LMs are expected to leverage the relevant demonstrations in the Lifelong ICL prompt, avoid distraction and interference from other tasks, and achieve test accuracies that are not significantly worse than the Single-task ICL baseline.
  Task Haystack draws inspiration from the widely-adopted "needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) evaluation, but presents new and unique challenges. It demands that models (1) utilize the contexts with deeper understanding, rather than resorting to simple copying and pasting; (2) navigate through long streams of evolving topics and tasks, which closely approximates the complexities of real-world usage of long-context LMs. Additionally, Task Haystack inherits the controllability aspect of NIAH, providing model developers with tools and visualizations to identify model vulnerabilities effectively.
  We benchmark 12 long-context LMs using Task Haystack. We find that state-of-the-art closed models such as GPT-4o still struggle in this setting, failing 15% of the cases on average, while all open-weight models we evaluate further lack behind by a large margin, failing up to 61% of the cases. In our controlled analysis, we identify factors such as distraction and recency bias as contributors to these failure cases. Further, we observe declines in performance when task instructions are paraphrased at test time or when ICL demonstrations are repeated excessively, raising concerns about the robustness, instruction understanding, and true context utilization of current long-context LMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Citywalk, a recently popular form of urban travel, requires genuine personalization and understanding of fine-grained requests compared to traditional itinerary planning. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), which generates personalized urban itineraries from user requests in natural language. We then present ITINERA, an OUIP system that integrates spatial optimization with large language models to provide customized urban itineraries based on user needs. This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary. Experiments on real-world datasets and the performance of the deployed system demonstrate our system's capacity to deliver personalized and spatially coherent itineraries compared to current solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prasanna Vijayaraghavan, Jeffrey Frederic Queisser, Sergio Verduzco Flores, Jun Tani</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic. "How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns?" To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference, based on the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions, is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced significantly by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuo-motor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, such as GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing standard queries. Despite these advancements, their performance substantially declines in \textbf{advanced mathematical problems requiring complex, multi-step logical reasoning}. To enhance their inferential capabilities, current research has delved into \textit{prompting engineering}, exemplified by methodologies such as the Tree of Thought and Graph of Thought. Nonetheless, these existing approaches encounter two significant limitations. Firstly, their effectiveness in tackling complex mathematical problems is somewhat constrained. Secondly, the necessity to design distinct prompts for individual problems hampers their generalizability. In response to these limitations, this paper introduces the \textit{Multi-Agent System for conditional Mining} (\textbf{MACM}) prompting method. It not only resolves intricate mathematical problems but also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various mathematical contexts. With the assistance of MACM, the accuracy of GPT-4 Turbo on the most challenging level five mathematical problems in the MATH dataset increase from $\mathbf{54.68\%} \text{ to } \mathbf{76.73\%}$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reihaneh Amini, Sanaz Saki Norouzi, Pascal Hitzler, Reza Amini</p>
<p>Abstract: Ontology alignment, a critical process in the Semantic Web for detecting relationships between different ontologies, has traditionally focused on identifying so-called "simple" 1-to-1 relationships through class labels and properties comparison. The more practically useful exploration of more complex alignments remains a hard problem to automate, and as such is largely underexplored, i.e. in application practice it is usually done manually by ontology and domain experts. Recently, the surge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, driven by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities for enhancing ontology engineering practices, including ontology alignment tasks. This paper investigates the application of LLM technologies to tackle the complex ontology alignment challenge. Leveraging a prompt-based approach and integrating rich ontology content so-called modules our work constitutes a significant advance towards automating the complex alignment task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyue Fu, Hao Guan, Kounianhua Du, Jianghao Lin, Wei Xia, Weinan Zhang, Ruiming Tang, Yasheng Wang, Yong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to determine whether students will respond correctly to the next question, which is a crucial task in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In educational KT scenarios, transductive ID-based methods often face severe data sparsity and cold start problems, where interactions between individual students and questions are sparse, and new questions and concepts consistently arrive in the database. In addition, existing KT models only implicitly consider the correlation between concepts and questions, lacking direct modeling of the more complex relationships in the heterogeneous graph of concepts and questions. In this paper, we propose a Structure-aware Inductive Knowledge Tracing model with large language model (dubbed SINKT), which, for the first time, introduces large language models (LLMs) and realizes inductive knowledge tracing. Firstly, SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural relationships between concepts and constructs a heterogeneous graph for concepts and questions. Secondly, by encoding concepts and questions with LLMs, SINKT incorporates semantic information to aid prediction. Finally, SINKT predicts the student's response to the target question by interacting with the student's knowledge state and the question representation. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SINKT achieves state-of-the-art performance among 12 existing transductive KT models. Additionally, we explore the performance of SINKT on the inductive KT task and provide insights into various modules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namkyeong Lee, Siddhartha Laghuvarapu, Chanyoung Park, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest among researchers in understanding molecules and their textual descriptions through molecule language models (MoLM). However, despite some early promising developments, the advancement of MoLM still trails significantly behind that of vision language models (VLM). This is because unique challenges exist apart from VLM in the field of MoLM due to 1) a limited amount of molecule-text paired data and 2) missing expertise that occurred due to the specialized areas of focus among the experts. To this end, we propose AMOLE, which 1) augments molecule-text pairs with structural similarity preserving loss, and 2) transfers the expertise between the molecules. Specifically, AMOLE enriches molecule-text pairs by sharing descriptions among structurally similar molecules with a novel structural similarity preserving loss. Moreover, we propose an expertise reconstruction loss to transfer knowledge from molecules that have extensive expertise to those with less expertise. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate the superiority of AMOLE in comprehending molecules and their descriptions, highlighting its potential for application in real-world drug discovery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohan Lin, Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Sean Welleck</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional language model-based theorem proving assumes that by training on a sufficient amount of formal proof data, a model will learn to prove theorems. Our key observation is that a wealth of informal information that is not present in formal proofs can be useful for learning to prove theorems. For instance, humans think through steps of a proof, but this thought process is not visible in the resulting code. We present Lean-STaR, a framework for training language models to produce informal thoughts prior to each step of a proof, thereby boosting the model's theorem-proving capabilities. Lean-STaR uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to generate synthetic thoughts for training the language model. At inference time, the trained model directly generates the thoughts prior to the prediction of the tactics in each proof step. Building on the self-taught reasoner framework, we then apply expert iteration to further fine-tune the model on the correct proofs it samples and verifies using the Lean solver. Lean-STaR achieves state-of-the-art results on the miniF2F-test benchmark within the Lean theorem proving environment, significantly outperforming base models ($\boldsymbol{43.4\% \rightarrow 46.3\%,}$ Pass@64). We also analyze the impact of the augmented thoughts on various aspects of the theorem proving process, providing insights into their effectiveness.</p>

Initially confined to simple persona consistency due to limited model capabilities, role-playing tasks have now expanded to embrace complex character portrayals involving character consistency, behavioral alignment, and overall attractiveness. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the critical components in designing these systems, including data, models and alignment, agent architecture and evaluation. This survey not only outlines the current methodologies and challenges, such as managing dynamic personal profiles and achieving high-level persona consistency but also suggests avenues for future research in improving the depth and realism of role-playing applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Lohse, Jonas Wahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the performance of causal discovery algorithms that aim to find causal relationships between time-dependent processes remains a challenging topic. In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chulin Xie, De-An Huang, Wenda Chu, Daguang Xu, Chaowei Xiao, Bo Li, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle data heterogeneity across clients in FL. However, existing pFL methods either (1) introduce high communication and computation costs or (2) overfit to local data, which can be limited in scope, and are vulnerable to evolved test samples with natural shifts. In this paper, we propose PerAda, a parameter-efficient pFL framework that reduces communication and computational costs and exhibits superior generalization performance, especially under test-time distribution shifts. PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of additional parameters from adapters. PerAda has good generalization since it regularizes each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter, while the global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information from all clients. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds to explain why PerAda improves generalization, and we prove its convergence to stationary points under non-convex settings. Empirically, PerAda demonstrates competitive personalized performance (+4.85% on CheXpert) and enables better out-of-distribution generalization (+5.23% on CIFAR-10-C) on different datasets across natural and medical domains compared with baselines, while only updating 12.6% of parameters per model based on the adapter.

<p>Abstract: As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) provides rich human body information for various real-world applications. While image-based HMR methods have achieved impressive results, they often struggle to recover humans in dynamic scenarios, leading to temporal inconsistencies and non-smooth 3D motion predictions due to the absence of human motion. In contrast, video-based approaches leverage temporal information to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we present DiffMesh, an innovative motion-aware Diffusion-like framework for video-based HMR. DiffMesh establishes a bridge between diffusion models and human motion, efficiently generating accurate and smooth output mesh sequences by incorporating human motion within the forward process and reverse process in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M \cite{h36m_pami} and 3DPW \cite{pw3d2018}), which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiffMesh. Visual comparisons in real-world scenarios further highlight DiffMesh's suitability for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Haoyu Dong, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated tumor detection in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is a difficult task due to natural tumor rarity, breast tissue variability, and high resolution. Given the scarcity of abnormal images and the abundance of normal images for this problem, an anomaly detection/localization approach could be well-suited. However, most anomaly localization research in machine learning focuses on non-medical datasets, and we find that these methods fall short when adapted to medical imaging datasets. The problem is alleviated when we solve the task from the image completion perspective, in which the presence of anomalies can be indicated by a discrepancy between the original appearance and its auto-completion conditioned on the surroundings. However, there are often many valid normal completions given the same surroundings, especially in the DBT dataset, making this evaluation criterion less precise. To address such an issue, we consider pluralistic image completion by exploring the distribution of possible completions instead of generating fixed predictions. This is achieved through our novel application of spatial dropout on the completion network during inference time only, which requires no additional training cost and is effective at generating diverse completions. We further propose minimum completion distance (MCD), a new metric for detecting anomalies, thanks to these stochastic completions. We provide theoretical as well as empirical support for the superiority over existing methods of using the proposed method for anomaly localization. On the DBT dataset, our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by at least 10\% AUROC for pixel-level detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Egor Cherepanov, Alexey Staroverov, Dmitry Yudin, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the use of transformers in offline reinforcement learning has become a rapidly developing area. This is due to their ability to treat the agent's trajectory in the environment as a sequence, thereby reducing the policy learning problem to sequence modeling. In environments where the agent's decisions depend on past events (POMDPs), capturing both the event itself and the decision point in the context of the model is essential. However, the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism limits the potential for context expansion. One solution to this problem is to enhance transformers with memory mechanisms. This paper proposes a Recurrent Action Transformer with Memory (RATE), a novel model architecture incorporating a recurrent memory mechanism designed to regulate information retention. To evaluate our model, we conducted extensive experiments on memory-intensive environments (ViZDoom-Two-Colors, T-Maze, Memory Maze, Minigrid.Memory), classic Atari games and MuJoCo control environments. The results show that using memory can significantly improve performance in memory-intensive environments while maintaining or improving results in classic environments. We hope our findings will stimulate research on memory mechanisms for transformers applicable to offline reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Chen, Denis Krompass, Jindong Gu, Volker Tresp</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm, in which multiple clients collaboratively train ML models without centralizing their local data. Similar to conventional ML pipelines, the client local optimization and server aggregation procedure in FL are sensitive to the hyperparameter (HP) selection. Despite extensive research on tuning HPs for centralized ML, these methods yield suboptimal results when employed in FL. This is mainly because their "training-after-tuning" framework is unsuitable for FL with limited client computation power. While some approaches have been proposed for HP-Tuning in FL, they are limited to the HPs for client local updates. In this work, we propose a novel HP-tuning algorithm, called Federated Population-based Hyperparameter Tuning (FedPop), to address this vital yet challenging problem. FedPop employs population-based evolutionary algorithms to optimize the HPs, which accommodates various HP types at both the client and server sides. Compared with prior tuning methods, FedPop employs an online "tuning-while-training" framework, offering computational efficiency and enabling the exploration of a broader HP search space. Our empirical validation on the common FL benchmarks and complex real-world FL datasets, including full-sized Non-IID ImageNet-1K, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms the concurrent state-of-the-art HP-tuning methods in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy DeLise</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-life machine learning problems exhibit distributional shifts in the data from one time to another or from one place to another. This behavior is beyond the scope of the traditional empirical risk minimization paradigm, which assumes i.i.d. distribution of data over time and across locations. The emerging field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization addresses this reality with new theory and algorithms which incorporate "environmental", or "era-wise" information into the algorithms. So far, most research has been focused on linear models and/or neural networks . In this research we develop two new splitting criteria for decision trees, which allow us to apply ideas from OOD generalization research to decision tree models, namely, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). The new splitting criteria use era-wise information associated with the data to grow tree-based models that are optimal across all disjoint eras in the data, instead of optimal over the entire data set pooled together, which is the default setting. In this paper, two new splitting criteria are defined and analyzed theoretically. Effectiveness is tested on four experiments, ranging from simple, synthetic to complex, real-world applications. In particular we cast the OOD domain-adaptation problem in the context of financial markets, where the new models out-perform state-of-the-art GBDT models on the Numerai data set. The new criteria are incorporated into the Scikit-Learn code base and made freely available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Yassine (IRT b-com, Hypermedia), Luc Le Magoarou (INSA Rennes, IETR), Matthieu Crussi\`ere (IETR), Stephane Paquelet (IRT b-com)</p>
<p>Abstract: Channel charting (CC) consists in learning a mapping between the space of raw channel observations, made available from pilot-based channel estimation in multicarrier multiantenna system, and a low-dimensional space where close points correspond to channels of user equipments (UEs) close spatially. Among the different methods of learning this mapping, some rely on a distance measure between channel vectors. Such a distance should reliably reflect the local spatial neighborhoods of the UEs. The recently proposed phase-insensitive (PI) distance exhibits good properties in this regards, but suffers from ambiguities due to both its periodic and oscillatory aspects, making users far away from each other appear closer in some cases. In this paper, a thorough theoretical analysis of the said distance and its limitations is provided, giving insights on how they can be mitigated. Guidelines for designing systems capable of learning quality charts are consequently derived. Experimental validation is then conducted on synthetic and realistic data in different scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marvin Schmitt, Desi R. Ivanova, Daniel Habermann, Ullrich K\"othe, Paul-Christian B\"urkner, Stefan T. Radev</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of amortized Bayesian inference by leveraging universal symmetries in the joint probabilistic model of parameters and data. In a nutshell, we invert Bayes' theorem and estimate the marginal likelihood based on approximate representations of the joint model. Upon perfect approximation, the marginal likelihood is constant across all parameter values by definition. However, errors in approximate inference lead to undesirable variance in the marginal likelihood estimates across different parameter values. We penalize violations of this symmetry with a \textit{self-consistency loss} which significantly improves the quality of approximate inference in low data regimes and can be used to augment the training of popular neural density estimators. We apply our method to a number of synthetic problems and realistic scientific models, discovering notable advantages in the context of both neural posterior and likelihood approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze-Feng Gao, Shuai Qu, Bocheng Zeng, Yang Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Hao Sun, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianheng Ling, Chao Qian, Gregor Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: Soft sensors are crucial in bridging autonomous systems' physical and digital realms, enhancing sensor fusion and perception. Instead of deploying soft sensors on the Cloud, this study shift towards employing on-device soft sensors, promising heightened efficiency and bolstering data security. Our approach substantially improves energy efficiency by deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly on devices within a wireless sensor network. Furthermore, the synergistic integration of the Microcontroller Unit and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) leverages the rapid AI inference capabilities of the latter. Empirical evidence from our real-world use case demonstrates that FPGA-based soft sensors achieve inference times ranging remarkably from 1.04 to 12.04 microseconds. These compelling results highlight the considerable potential of our innovative approach for executing real-time inference tasks efficiently, thereby presenting a feasible alternative that effectively addresses the latency challenges intrinsic to Cloud-based deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibo Wang, Chenghang Lai, Yixuan Sun, Weifeng Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions based on the information observed in videos. Despite the recent success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in image-language understanding and reasoning, they deal with VideoQA insufficiently, by simply taking uniformly sampled frames as visual inputs, which ignores question-relevant visual clues. Moreover, there are no human annotations for question-critical timestamps in existing VideoQA datasets. In light of this, we propose a novel weakly supervised framework to enforce the LMMs to reason out the answers with question-critical moments as visual inputs. Specifically, we first fuse the question and answer pairs as event descriptions to find multiple keyframes as target moments and pseudo-labels, with the visual-language alignment capability of the CLIP models. With these pseudo-labeled keyframes as additionally weak supervision, we devise a lightweight Gaussian-based Contrastive Grounding (GCG) module. GCG learns multiple Gaussian functions to characterize the temporal structure of the video, and sample question-critical frames as positive moments to be the visual inputs of LMMs. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our framework, and we achieve substantial improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the number of accepted papers at AI and ML conferences reaches into the thousands, it has become unclear how researchers access and read research publications. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media influencers in enhancing the visibility of machine learning research, particularly the citation counts of papers they share. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 8,000 papers, spanning tweets from December 2018 to October 2023, alongside controls precisely matched by 9 key covariates. Our statistical and causal inference analysis reveals a significant increase in citations for papers endorsed by these influencers, with median citation counts 2-3 times higher than those of the control group. Additionally, the study delves into the geographic, gender, and institutional diversity of highlighted authors. Given these findings, we advocate for a responsible approach to curation, encouraging influencers to uphold the journalistic standard that includes showcasing diverse research topics, authors, and institutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutao Feng, Xiang Feng, Yintong Shang, Ying Jiang, Chang Yu, Zeshun Zong, Tianjia Shao, Hongzhi Wu, Kun Zhou, Chenfanfu Jiang, Yin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating physics-based animations of solids and fluids with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create novel effects in virtual scenes reconstructed using 3DGS. Leveraging the coherence of the Gaussian Splatting and Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) in the underlying representation, we manage rendering, view synthesis, and the dynamics of solids and fluids in a cohesive manner. Similar to GaussianShader, we enhance each Gaussian kernel with an added normal, aligning the kernel's orientation with the surface normal to refine the PBD simulation. This approach effectively eliminates spiky noises that arise from rotational deformation in solids. It also allows us to integrate physically based rendering to augment the dynamic surface reflections on fluids. Consequently, our framework is capable of realistically reproducing surface highlights on dynamic fluids and facilitating interactions between scene objects and fluids from new views.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10778">AutoGPT+P: Affordance-based Task Planning with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Birr, Christoph Pohl, Abdelrahman Younes, Tamim Asfour</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in task planning leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve generalizability by combining such models with classical planning algorithms to address their inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities. However, these approaches face the challenge of dynamically capturing the initial state of the task planning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning with arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive and execute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. In addition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+P can also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missing objects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partial plan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection with an automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The core planning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic and syntactic errors. Our approach achieves a success rate of 98%, surpassing the current 81% success rate of the current state-of-the-art LLM-based planning method SayCan on the SayCan instruction set. Furthermore, we evaluated our approach on our newly created dataset with 150 scenarios covering a wide range of complex tasks with missing objects, achieving a success rate of 79% on our dataset. The dataset and the code are publicly available at https://git.h2t.iar.kit.edu/birr/autogpt-p-standalone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Hammar, Tao Li, Rolf Stadler, Quanyan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present our method through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that our method produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that our method enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lele Cao, Valentin Buchner, Zineb Senane, Fangkai Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically assessed using expensive annotated multimodal benchmarks, which often lag behind the rapidly evolving demands of MLLM evaluation. This paper outlines and validates GenCeption, a novel, annotation-free evaluation method that requires only unimodal data to measure inter-modality semantic coherence and inversely assesses MLLMs' tendency to hallucinate. This approach eliminates the need for costly data annotation, minimizes the risk of training data contamination, results in slower benchmark saturation, and avoids the illusion of emerging abilities. Inspired by the DrawCeption game, GenCeption begins with a non-textual sample and proceeds through iterative description and generation steps. The semantic drift across iterations is quantified using the GC@T metric. Based on the GenCeption method, we establish the MMECeption benchmark for evaluating Vision LLMs (VLLMs), and compare performance of several popular VLLMs and human annotators. Our empirical results validate GenCeption's effectiveness, demonstrating strong correlations with established VLLM benchmarks. VLLMs still significantly lack behind human performance and struggle especially with text-intensive tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Lin, Xiaoyuan Zhang, Zhiyuan Yang, Fei Liu, Zhenkun Wang, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems can be found in many real-world applications, where the objectives often conflict each other and cannot be optimized by a single solution. In the past few decades, numerous methods have been proposed to find Pareto solutions that represent optimal trade-offs among the objectives for a given problem. However, these existing methods could have high computational complexity or may not have good theoretical properties for solving a general differentiable multi-objective optimization problem. In this work, by leveraging the smooth optimization technique, we propose a lightweight and efficient smooth Tchebycheff scalarization approach for gradient-based multi-objective optimization. It has good theoretical properties for finding all Pareto solutions with valid trade-off preferences, while enjoying significantly lower computational complexity compared to other methods. Experimental results on various real-world application problems fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

We also introduce BrowserGym, an environment for the design and evaluation of such agents, offering a rich set of actions as well as multimodal observations. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current agents show promise on WorkArena, there remains a considerable gap towards achieving full task automation. Notably, our analysis uncovers a significant performance disparity between open and closed-source LLMs, highlighting a critical area for future exploration and development in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recently developed Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) have shown very promising results for applications in low-data regimes. The TabPFN model, a special case of PFNs for tabular data, is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of classification tasks while producing posterior predictive distributions in mere seconds by in-context learning without the need for learning parameters or hyperparameter tuning. This makes TabPFN a very attractive option for a wide range of domain applications. However, a major drawback of the method is its lack of interpretability. Therefore, we propose several adaptations of popular interpretability methods that we specifically design for TabPFN. By taking advantage of the unique properties of the model, our adaptations allow for more efficient computations than existing implementations. In particular, we show how in-context learning facilitates the estimation of Shapley values by avoiding approximate retraining and enables the use of Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) even when working with large-scale Transformers. In addition, we demonstrate how data valuation methods can be used to address scalability challenges of TabPFN. Our proposed methods are implemented in a package tabpfn_iml and made available at https://github.com/david-rundel/tabpfn_iml.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent AI-based text-to-image models not only excel at generating realistic images, they also give designers more and more fine-grained control over the image content. Consequently, these approaches have gathered increased attention within the computer graphics research community, which has been historically devoted towards traditional rendering techniques that offer precise control over scene parameters such as objects, materials, and lighting, when generating realistic images. While the quality of rendered images is traditionally assessed through well-established image quality metrics, such as SSIM or PSNR, the unique challenges presented by text-to-image models, which in contrast to rendering interweave the control of scene and rendering parameters, necessitate the development of novel image quality metrics. Therefore, within this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing text-to-image quality metrics addressing their nuances and the need for alignment with human preferences. Based on our findings, we propose a new taxonomy for categorizing these metrics, which is grounded in the assumption that there are two main quality criteria, namely compositionality and generality, which ideally map to human preferences. Ultimately, we derive guidelines for practitioners conducting text-to-image evaluation, discuss open challenges of evaluation mechanisms, and surface limitations of current metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks that process the parameters of other neural networks find applications in domains as diverse as classifying implicit neural representations, generating neural network weights, and predicting generalization errors. However, existing approaches either overlook the inherent permutation symmetry in the neural network or rely on intricate weight-sharing patterns to achieve equivariance, while ignoring the impact of the network architecture itself. In this work, we propose to represent neural networks as computational graphs of parameters, which allows us to harness powerful graph neural networks and transformers that preserve permutation symmetry. Consequently, our approach enables a single model to encode neural computational graphs with diverse architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of tasks, including classification and editing of implicit neural representations, predicting generalization performance, and learning to optimize, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Wu, Yizhou Wang, Shixiang Tang, Wenhao Wu, Tong He, Wanli Ouyang, Philip Torr, Jian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present DetToolChain, a novel prompting paradigm, to unleash the zero-shot object detection ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V and Gemini. Our approach consists of a detection prompting toolkit inspired by high-precision detection priors and a new Chain-of-Thought to implement these prompts. Specifically, the prompts in the toolkit are designed to guide the MLLM to focus on regional information (e.g., zooming in), read coordinates according to measure standards (e.g., overlaying rulers and compasses), and infer from the contextual information (e.g., overlaying scene graphs). Building upon these tools, the new detection chain-of-thought can automatically decompose the task into simple subtasks, diagnose the predictions, and plan for progressive box refinements. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated across a spectrum of detection tasks, especially hard cases. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, GPT-4V with our DetToolChain improves state-of-the-art object detectors by +21.5% AP50 on MS COCO Novel class set for open-vocabulary detection, +24.23% Acc on RefCOCO val set for zero-shot referring expression comprehension, +14.5% AP on D-cube describe object detection FULL setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present Export3D, a one-shot 3D-aware portrait animation method that is able to control the facial expression and camera view of a given portrait image. To achieve this, we introduce a tri-plane generator with an effective expression conditioning method, which directly generates a tri-plane of 3D prior by transferring the expression parameter of 3DMM into the source image. The tri-plane is then decoded into the image of different view through a differentiable volume rendering. Existing portrait animation methods heavily rely on image warping to transfer the expression in the motion space, challenging on disentanglement of appearance and expression. In contrast, we propose a contrastive pre-training framework for appearance-free expression parameter, eliminating undesirable appearance swap when transferring a cross-identity expression. Extensive experiments show that our pre-training framework can learn the appearance-free expression representation hidden in 3DMM, and our model can generate 3D-aware expression controllable portrait images without appearance swap in the cross-identity manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bartlomiej Sobieski, Przemys{\l}aw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite increasing progress in development of methods for generating visual counterfactual explanations, especially with the recent rise of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, previous works consider them as an entirely local technique. In this work, we take the first step at globalizing them. Specifically, we discover that the latent space of Diffusion Autoencoders encodes the inference process of a given classifier in the form of global directions. We propose a novel proxy-based approach that discovers two types of these directions with the use of only single image in an entirely black-box manner. Precisely, g-directions allow for flipping the decision of a given classifier on an entire dataset of images, while h-directions further increase the diversity of explanations. We refer to them in general as Global Counterfactual Directions (GCDs). Moreover, we show that GCDs can be naturally combined with Latent Integrated Gradients resulting in a new black-box attribution method, while simultaneously enhancing the understanding of counterfactual explanations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyu Long, Qiyuan Wang, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Daning Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has become popular due to its robustness and avoidance of centralized coordination. In this paradigm, clients actively engage in training by exchanging models with their networked neighbors. However, DFL introduces increased costs in terms of training and communication. Existing methods focus on minimizing communication often overlooking training efficiency and data heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose a novel \textit{sparse-to-sparser} training scheme: DA-DPFL. DA-DPFL initializes with a subset of model parameters, which progressively reduces during training via \textit{dynamic aggregation} and leads to substantial energy savings while retaining adequate information during critical learning periods.
  Our experiments showcase that DA-DPFL substantially outperforms DFL baselines in test accuracy, while achieving up to $5$ times reduction in energy costs. We provide a theoretical analysis of DA-DPFL's convergence by solidifying its applicability in decentralized and personalized learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Awais Athar, Agha Ali Raza</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces UQA, a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. UQA is generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0), a large-scale English QA dataset, using a technique called EATS (Enclose to Anchor, Translate, Seek), which preserves the answer spans in the translated context paragraphs. The paper describes the process of selecting and evaluating the best translation model among two candidates: Google Translator and Seamless M4T. The paper also benchmarks several state-of-the-art multilingual QA models on UQA, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5, and reports promising results. For XLM-RoBERTa-XL, we have an F1 score of 85.99 and 74.56 EM. UQA is a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and for enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models. Further, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EATS for creating high-quality datasets for other languages and domains. The UQA dataset and the code are publicly available at www.github.com/sameearif/UQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minyoung Huh, Brian Cheung, Tongzhou Wang, Phillip Isola</p>
<p>Abstract: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP) where the goal of an agent is to maximize the expected discounted sum of rewards over an infinite horizon while ensuring that the expected discounted sum of costs exceeds a certain threshold. Building on the idea of momentum-based acceleration, we develop the Primal-Dual Accelerated Natural Policy Gradient (PD-ANPG) algorithm that guarantees an $\epsilon$ global optimality gap and $\epsilon$ constraint violation with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for general parameterized policies. This improves the state-of-the-art sample complexity in general parameterized CMDPs by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and achieves the theoretical lower bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiou Ge, Ali Mousavi, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Kun Qian, Benjamin Han, Mostafa Arefiyan, Yunyao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in different tasks and are bringing transformative changes to many domains. However, keeping the knowledge in LLMs up-to-date remains a challenge once pretraining is complete. It is thus essential to design effective methods to both update obsolete knowledge and induce new knowledge into LLMs. Existing locate-and-edit knowledge editing (KE) method suffers from two limitations. First, the post-edit LLMs by such methods generally have poor capability in answering complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning. Second, the long run-time of such locate-and-edit methods to perform knowledge edits make it infeasible for large scale KE in practice. In this paper, we explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as an alternative for KE. We curate a more comprehensive temporal KE dataset with both knowledge update and knowledge injection examples for KE performance benchmarking. We further probe the effect of fine-tuning on a range of layers in an LLM for the multi-hop QA task. We find that PEFT performs better than locate-and-edit techniques for time-sensitive knowledge edits.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a recent boom in the development of AI solutions to facilitate and enhance diagnostic procedures for established clinical tools. To assess the integrity of the developing nervous system, the Prechtl general movement assessment (GMA) is recognized for its clinical value in diagnosing neurological impairments in early infancy. GMA has been increasingly augmented through machine learning approaches intending to scale-up its application, circumvent costs in the training of human assessors and further standardize classification of spontaneous motor patterns. Available deep learning tools, all of which are based on single sensor modalities, are however still considerably inferior to that of well-trained human assessors. These approaches are hardly comparable as all models are designed, trained and evaluated on proprietary/silo-data sets. With this study we propose a sensor fusion approach for assessing fidgety movements (FMs) comparing three different sensor modalities (pressure, inertial, and visual sensors). Various combinations and two sensor fusion approaches (late and early fusion) for infant movement classification were tested to evaluate whether a multi-sensor system outperforms single modality assessments. The performance of the three-sensor fusion (classification accuracy of 94.5\%) was significantly higher than that of any single modality evaluated, suggesting the sensor fusion approach is a promising avenue for automated classification of infant motor patterns. The development of a robust sensor fusion system may significantly enhance AI-based early recognition of neurofunctions, ultimately facilitating automated early detection of neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The neonatal period is the most vulnerable time for the development of seizures. Seizures in the immature brain lead to detrimental consequences, therefore require early diagnosis. The gold-standard for neonatal seizure detection currently relies on continuous video-EEG monitoring; which involves recording multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) alongside real-time video monitoring within a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, video-EEG monitoring technology requires clinical expertise and is often limited to technologically advanced and resourceful settings. Cost-effective new techniques could help the medical fraternity make an accurate diagnosis and advocate treatment without delay. In this work, a novel explainable deep learning model to automate the neonatal seizure detection process with a reduced EEG montage is proposed, which employs convolutional nets, graph attention layers, and fully connected layers. Beyond its ability to detect seizures in real-time with a reduced montage, this model offers the unique advantage of real-time interpretability. By evaluating the performance on the Zenodo dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the presented model achieves an absolute improvement of 8.31% and 42.86% in area under curve (AUC) and recall, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the integration of graph knowledge from linguistic ontologies into multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) using adapters to improve performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) in sentiment analysis (SA) and named entity recognition (NER). Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Usneek Singh, Jos\'e Cambronero, Sumit Gulwani, Aditya Kanade, Anirudh Khatry, Vu Le, Mukul Singh, Gust Verbruggen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyang Wu, Nan Guo, Xiao Xiao, Wenming Li, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in understanding human instructions and generating code, which has inspired researchers to explore the feasibility of generating RTL code with LLMs. However, the existing approaches to fine-tune LLMs on RTL codes typically are conducted on fixed datasets, which do not fully stimulate the capability of LLMs and require large amounts of reference data. To mitigate these issues , we introduce a simple yet effective iterative training paradigm named ITERTL. During each iteration, samples are drawn from the model trained in the previous cycle. Then these new samples are employed for training in this loop. Through this iterative approach, the distribution mismatch between the model and the training samples is reduced. Additionally, the model is thus enabled to explore a broader generative space and receive more comprehensive feedback. Theoretical analyses are conducted to investigate the mechanism of the effectiveness. Experimental results show the model trained through our proposed approach can compete with and even outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source model with nearly 37\% reference samples, achieving remarkable 42.9\% and 62.2\% pass@1 rate on two VerilogEval evaluation datasets respectively. While using the same amount of reference samples, our method can achieved a relative improvement of 16.9\% and 12.5\% in pass@1 compared to the non-iterative method. This study facilitates the application of LLMs for generating RTL code in practical scenarios with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaspreet Pannu, Doni Bloomfield, Alex Zhu, Robert MacKnight, Gabe Gomes, Anita Cicero, Thomas V. Inglesby</p>
<p>Abstract: As a result of rapidly accelerating AI capabilities, over the past year, national governments and multinational bodies have announced efforts to address safety, security and ethics issues related to AI models. One high priority among these efforts is the mitigation of misuse of AI models. Many biologists have for decades sought to reduce the risks of scientific research that could lead, through accident or misuse, to high-consequence disease outbreaks. Scientists have carefully considered what types of life sciences research have the potential for both benefit and risk (dual-use), especially as scientific advances have accelerated our ability to engineer organisms and create novel variants of pathogens. Here we describe how previous experience and study by scientists and policy professionals of dual-use capabilities in the life sciences can inform risk evaluations of AI models with biological capabilities. We argue that AI model evaluations should prioritize addressing high-consequence risks (those that could cause large-scale harm to the public, such as pandemics), and that these risks should be evaluated prior to model deployment so as to allow potential biosafety and/or biosecurity measures. Scientists' experience with identifying and mitigating dual-use biological risks can help inform new approaches to evaluating biological AI models. Identifying which AI capabilities post the greatest biosecurity and biosafety concerns is necessary in order to establish targeted AI safety evaluation methods, secure these tools against accident and misuse, and avoid impeding immense potential benefits.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces LiNR, LinkedIn's large-scale, GPU-based retrieval system. LiNR supports a billion-sized index on GPU models. We discuss our experiences and challenges in creating scalable, differentiable search indexes using TensorFlow and PyTorch at production scale. In LiNR, both items and model weights are integrated into the model binary. Viewing index construction as a form of model training, we describe scaling our system for large indexes, incorporating full scans and efficient filtering. A key focus is on enabling attribute-based pre-filtering for exhaustive GPU searches, addressing the common challenge of post-filtering in KNN searches that often reduces system quality. We further provide multi-embedding retrieval algorithms and strategies for tackling cold start issues in retrieval. Our advancements in supporting larger indexes through quantization are also discussed. We believe LiNR represents one of the industry's first Live-updated model-based retrieval indexes. Applied to out-of-network post recommendations on LinkedIn Feed, LiNR has contributed to a 3% relative increase in professional daily active users. We envisage LiNR as a step towards integrating retrieval and ranking into a single GPU model, simplifying complex infrastructures and enabling end-to-end optimization of the entire differentiable infrastructure through gradient descent.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ethical implications and potentials for misuse of Generative Artificial Intelligence are increasingly worrying topics. This paper explores how easily the default ethical guardrails of ChatGPT, using its latest customization features, can be bypassed by simple prompts and fine-tuning, that can be effortlessly accessed by the broad public. This malevolently altered version of ChatGPT, nicknamed "RogueGPT", responded with worrying behaviours, beyond those triggered by jailbreak prompts. We conduct an empirical study of RogueGPT responses, assessing its flexibility in answering questions pertaining to what should be disallowed usage. Our findings raise significant concerns about the model's knowledge about topics like illegal drug production, torture methods and terrorism. The ease of driving ChatGPT astray, coupled with its global accessibility, highlights severe issues regarding the data quality used for training the foundational model and the implementation of ethical safeguards. We thus underline the responsibilities and dangers of user-driven modifications, and the broader effects that these may have on the design of safeguarding and ethical modules implemented by AI programmers.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of searching through patent documents is crucial for chemical patent recommendation and retrieval. This can be enhanced by creating a patent knowledge base (ChemPatKB) to aid in prior art searches and to provide a platform for domain experts to explore new innovations in chemical compound synthesis and use-cases. An essential foundational component of this KB is the extraction of important reaction snippets from long patents documents which facilitates multiple downstream tasks such as reaction co-reference resolution and chemical entity role identification. In this work, we explore the problem of extracting reactions spans from chemical patents in order to create a reactions resource database. We formulate this task as a paragraph-level sequence tagging problem, where the system is required to return a sequence of paragraphs that contain a description of a reaction. We propose several approaches and modifications of the baseline models and study how different methods generalize across different domains of chemical patents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinfeng Wei, Xiaofeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce DOPRA, a novel approach designed to mitigate hallucinations in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike existing solutions that typically involve costly supplementary training data or the integration of external knowledge sources, DOPRA innovatively addresses hallucinations by decoding specific weighted layer penalties and redistribution, offering an economical and effective solution without additional resources. DOPRA is grounded in unique insights into the intrinsic mechanisms controlling hallucinations within MLLMs, especially the models' tendency to over-rely on a subset of summary tokens in the self-attention matrix, neglecting critical image-related information. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in certain strata. To counteract this over-reliance, DOPRA employs a strategy of weighted overlay penalties and redistribution in specific layers, such as the 12th layer, during the decoding process. Furthermore, DOPRA includes a retrospective allocation process that re-examines the sequence of generated tokens, allowing the algorithm to reallocate token selection to better align with the actual image content, thereby reducing the incidence of hallucinatory descriptions in auto-generated captions. Overall, DOPRA represents a significant step forward in improving the output quality of MLLMs by systematically reducing hallucinations through targeted adjustments during the decoding process.</p>

To solve this problem, we embed a Large Language Model (LLM) as knowledge into the GNN explanation network to avoid the learning bias problem.

We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The innovation of our work lies in two parts: 1. We provide a novel view of the possibility of an LLM functioning as a Bayesian inference to improve the performance of existing algorithms; 2.

<p>Abstract: The broadcasting industry is increasingly adopting IP techniques, revolutionising both live and pre-recorded content production, from news gathering to live music events. IP broadcasting allows for the transport of audio and video signals in an easily configurable way, aligning with modern networking techniques. This shift towards an IP workflow allows for much greater flexibility, not only in routing signals but with the integration of tools using standard web development techniques. One possible tool could include the use of live audio tagging, which has a number of uses in the production of content. These include from automated closed captioning to identifying unwanted sound events within a scene. In this paper, we describe the process of containerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated code module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network setups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable of seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small productions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the selected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end product are discussed.</p>
