<p>Despite their wide-spread success, Text-to-Image models (T2I) still struggle
to produce images that are both aesthetically pleasing and faithful to the
user's input text. We introduce DreamSync, a model-agnostic training algorithm
by design that improves T2I models to be faithful to the text input. DreamSync
builds off a recent insight from TIFA's evaluation framework -- that large
vision-language models (VLMs) can effectively identify the fine-grained
discrepancies between generated images and the text inputs. DreamSync uses this
insight to train T2I models without any labeled data; it improves T2I models
using its own generations. First, it prompts the model to generate several
candidate images for a given input text. Then, it uses two VLMs to select the
best generation: a Visual Question Answering model that measures the alignment
of generated images to the text, and another that measures the generation's
aesthetic quality. After selection, we use LoRA to iteratively finetune the T2I
model to guide its generation towards the selected best generations. DreamSync
does not need any additional human annotation. model architecture changes, or
reinforcement learning. Despite its simplicity, DreamSync improves both the
semantic alignment and aesthetic appeal of two diffusion-based T2I models,
evidenced by multiple benchmarks (+1.7% on TIFA, +2.9% on DSG1K, +3.4% on VILA
aesthetic) and human evaluation.

<p>This work introduces a general code generation framework that incorporates
infilling operations into auto-regressive decoding. Our approach capitalizes on
the observation that recent code language models with infilling capabilities
can perform \emph{self-infilling}: whereas infilling operations aim to fill in
the middle based on a predefined prefix and suffix, self-infilling sequentially
generates both such surrounding context and the infilled content. We utilize
this feature to develop an infilling-augmented decoding process that
facilitates non-monotonic generation. This approach allows for postponing the
generation of uncertain code snippets until a definitive suffix is established,
leading to improved control over the generation sequence. In addition, it
facilitates a looping mechanism, which can iteratively update and synchronize
each piece of generation in a cyclic manner. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate that our proposed decoding process is effective in
enhancing regularity and quality across several code generation benchmarks.

<p>Semi-Markov CRF has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional Linear
Chain CRF for text segmentation tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Unlike CRF, which treats text segmentation as token-level prediction, Semi-CRF
considers segments as the basic unit, making it more expressive. However,
Semi-CRF suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) quadratic complexity over
sequence length, as it operates on every span of the input sequence, and (2)
inferior performance compared to CRF for sequence labeling tasks like NER. In
this paper, we introduce Filtered Semi-Markov CRF, a variant of Semi-CRF that
addresses these issues by incorporating a filtering step to eliminate
irrelevant segments, reducing complexity and search space. Our approach is
evaluated on several NER benchmarks, where it outperforms both CRF and Semi-CRF
while being significantly faster. The implementation of our method is available
on \href{https://github.com/urchade/Filtered-Semi-Markov-CRF}{Github}.

<p>Cross-lingual transfer learning is an important property of multilingual
large language models (LLMs). But how do LLMs represent relationships between
languages? Every language model has an input layer that maps tokens to vectors.
This ubiquitous layer of language models is often overlooked. We find that
similarities between these input embeddings are highly interpretable and that
the geometry of these embeddings differs between model families. In one case
(XLM-RoBERTa), embeddings encode language: tokens in different writing systems
can be linearly separated with an average of 99.2% accuracy. Another family
(mT5) represents cross-lingual semantic similarity: the 50 nearest neighbors
for any token represent an average of 7.61 writing systems, and are frequently
translations. This result is surprising given that there is no explicit
parallel cross-lingual training corpora and no explicit incentive for
translations in pre-training objectives. Our research opens the door for
investigations in 1) The effect of pre-training and model architectures on
representations of languages and 2) The applications of cross-lingual
representations embedded in language models.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful summarization abilities.
However, their capabilities on conversational summarization remains under
explored. In this work we evaluate LLMs (approx. 10 billion parameters) on
conversational summarization and showcase their performance on various prompts.
We show that the summaries generated by models depend on the instructions and
the performance of LLMs vary with different instructions sometimes resulting
steep drop in ROUGE scores if prompts are not selected carefully. We also
evaluate the models with human evaluations and discuss the limitations of the
models on conversational summarization

<p>Potential harms of Large Language Models such as mass misinformation and
plagiarism can be partially mitigated if there exists a reliable way to detect
machine generated text. In this paper, we propose a new watermarking method to
detect machine-generated texts. Our method embeds a unique pattern within the
generated text, ensuring that while the content remains coherent and natural to
human readers, it carries distinct markers that can be identified
algorithmically. Specifically, we intervene with the token sampling process in
a way which enables us to trace back our token choices during the detection
phase. We show how watermarking affects textual quality and compare our
proposed method with a state-of-the-art watermarking method in terms of
robustness and detectability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our watermarking scheme in distinguishing between watermarked

<p>Turkish is one of the most popular languages in the world. Wide us of this
language on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, or Tiktok and
strategic position of the country in the world politics makes it appealing for
the social network researchers and industry. To address this need, we introduce
TurkishBERTweet, the first large scale pre-trained language model for Turkish
social media built using almost 900 million tweets. The model shares the same
architecture as base BERT model with smaller input length, making
TurkishBERTweet lighter than BERTurk and can have significantly lower inference
time. We trained our model using the same approach for RoBERTa model and
evaluated on two text classification tasks: Sentiment Classification and Hate
Speech Detection. We demonstrate that TurkishBERTweet outperforms the other
available alternatives on generalizability and its lower inference time gives
significant advantage to process large-scale datasets. We also compared our
models with the commercial OpenAI solutions in terms of cost and performance to
demonstrate TurkishBERTweet is scalable and cost-effective solution. As part of
our research, we released TurkishBERTweet and fine-tuned LoRA adapters for the
mentioned tasks under the MIT License to facilitate future research and
applications on Turkish social media. Our TurkishBERTweet model is available

<p>As generative large language models (LLMs) grow more performant and
prevalent, we must develop comprehensive enough tools to measure and improve
their fairness. Different prompt-based datasets can be used to measure social
bias across multiple text domains and demographic axes, meaning that testing
LLMs on more datasets can potentially help us characterize their biases more
fully, and better ensure equal and equitable treatment of marginalized
demographic groups. In this work, our focus is two-fold:
</p>
<p>(1) Benchmarking: a comparison of 6 different prompt-based bias and toxicity
metrics across 12 demographic axes and 5 families of generative LLMs. Out of
those 6 metrics, AdvPromptSet and HolisticBiasR are novel datasets proposed in
the paper. The comparison of those benchmarks gives us insights about the bias
and toxicity of the compared models. Therefore, we explore the frequency of
demographic terms in common LLM pre-training corpora and how this may relate to
model biases.
</p>
<p>(2) Mitigation: we conduct a comprehensive study of how well 3 bias/toxicity
mitigation techniques perform across our suite of measurements. ROBBIE aims to
provide insights for practitioners while deploying a model, emphasizing the
need to not only measure potential harms, but also understand how they arise by
characterizing the data, mitigate harms once found, and balance any trade-offs.
We open-source our analysis code in hopes of encouraging broader measurements
of bias in future LLMs.

<p>Counterspeech can be an effective method for battling hateful content on
social media. Automated counterspeech generation can aid in this process.
Generated counterspeech, however, can be viable only when grounded in the
context of topic, audience and sensitivity as these factors influence both the
efficacy and appropriateness. In this work, we propose a novel framework based
on theories of discourse to study the inferential links that connect counter
speeches to the hateful comment. Within this framework, we propose: i) a
taxonomy of counterspeech derived from discourse frameworks, and ii)
discourse-informed prompting strategies for generating contextually-grounded
counterspeech. To construct and validate this framework, we present a process
for collecting an in-the-wild dataset of counterspeech from Reddit. Using this
process, we manually annotate a dataset of 3.9k Reddit comment pairs for the
presence of hatespeech and counterspeech. The positive pairs are annotated for
10 classes in our proposed taxonomy. We annotate these pairs with paraphrased
counterparts to remove offensiveness and first-person references. We show that
by using our dataset and framework, large language models can generate
contextually-grounded counterspeech informed by theories of discourse.
According to our human evaluation, our approaches can act as a safeguard
against critical failures of discourse-agnostic models.

<p>Transformers have become the gold standard for many natural language
processing tasks and, in particular, for multi-hop question answering (MHQA).
This task includes processing a long document and reasoning over the multiple
parts of it. The landscape of MHQA approaches can be classified into two
primary categories. The first group focuses on extracting supporting evidence,
thereby constraining the QA model's context to predicted facts. Conversely, the
second group relies on the attention mechanism of the long input encoding model
to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, attention-based token
representations lack explicit global contextual information to connect
reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose GEMFormer, a two-stage
method that first collects relevant information over the entire document to the
memory and then combines it with local context to solve the task. Our
experimental results show that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with
memory-augmented input, including the most certain global elements, improves
the model's performance on three MHQA datasets compared to the baseline. We
also found that the global explicit memory contains information from supporting
facts required for the correct answer.

<p>In-context learning (ICL) refers to the ability of a model to condition on a
few in-context demonstrations (input-output examples of the underlying task) to
generate the answer for a new query input, without updating parameters. Despite
the impressive ICL ability of LLMs, it has also been found that ICL in LLMs is
sensitive to input demonstrations and limited to short context lengths. To
understand the limitations and principles for successful ICL, we conduct an
investigation with ICL linear regression of transformers. We characterize
several Out-of-Distribution (OOD) cases for ICL inspired by realistic LLM ICL
failures and compare transformers with DeepSet, a simple yet powerful
architecture for ICL. Surprisingly, DeepSet outperforms transformers across a
variety of distribution shifts, implying that preserving permutation invariance
symmetry to input demonstrations is crucial for OOD ICL. The phenomenon
specifies a fundamental requirement by ICL, which we termed as ICL invariance.
Nevertheless, the positional encodings in LLMs will break ICL invariance. To
this end, we further evaluate transformers with identical positional encodings
and find preserving ICL invariance in transformers achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various ICL distribution shifts

countries: Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria. The expertly curated dataset
includes annotations for 5,952 tweets, assessing their relevance to COVID-19

address challenges posed by domain specificity, the low-resource setting, and
data imbalance, we adopt two approaches for developing COVID-19 vaccine
misinformation detection models: domain-specific pre-training and text
augmentation using a large language model. Our best misinformation detection
models demonstrate improvements ranging from 2.7 to 15.9 percentage points in
macro F1-score compared to the baseline models. Additionally, we apply our
misinformation detection models in a large-scale study of 19 million unlabeled
tweets from the three countries between 2020 and 2022, showcasing the practical
application of our dataset and models for detecting and analyzing vaccine
misinformation in multiple countries and languages. Our analysis indicates that
percentage changes in the number of new COVID-19 cases are positively

<p>Computer-aided translation (CAT) aims to enhance human translation efficiency
and is still important in scenarios where machine translation cannot meet
quality requirements. One fundamental task within this field is Word-Level Auto
Completion (WLAC). WLAC predicts a target word given a source sentence,
translation context, and a human typed character sequence. Previous works
either employ word classification models to exploit contextual information from
both sides of the target word or directly disregarded the dependencies from the
right-side context. Furthermore, the key information, i.e. human typed
sequences, is only used as prefix constraints in the decoding module. In this
paper, we propose the INarIG (Iterative Non-autoregressive Instruct Generation)
model, which constructs the human typed sequence into Instruction Unit and
employs iterative decoding with subwords to fully utilize input information
given in the task. Our model is more competent in dealing with low-frequency
words (core scenario of this task), and achieves state-of-the-art results on
the WMT22 and benchmark datasets, with a maximum increase of over 10%

<p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates the development of
training approaches that mitigate the generation of unethical language and
aptly manage toxic user queries. Given the challenges related to human labor
and the scarcity of data, we present KoTox, comprising 39K unethical
instruction-output pairs. This collection of automatically generated toxic
instructions refines the training of LLMs and establishes a foundational
framework for improving LLMs' ethical awareness and response to various toxic
inputs, promoting more secure and responsible interactions in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) provide excellent text-generation capabilities,
but standard prompting and generation methods generally do not lead to
intentional or goal-directed agents and might necessitate considerable prompt
tuning. This becomes particularly apparent in multi-turn conversations: even
the best current LLMs rarely ask clarifying questions, engage in explicit
information gathering, or take actions now that lead to better decisions after
multiple turns. Reinforcement learning has the potential to leverage the
powerful modeling capabilities of LLMs, as well as their internal
representation of textual interactions, to create capable goal-directed
language agents. This can enable intentional and temporally extended
interactions, such as with humans, through coordinated persuasion and carefully
crafted questions, or in goal-directed play through text games to bring about
desired final outcomes. However, enabling this requires the community to
develop stable and reliable reinforcement learning algorithms that can
effectively train LLMs. Developing such algorithms requires tasks that can
gauge progress on algorithm design, provide accessible and reproducible
evaluations for multi-turn interactions, and cover a range of task properties
and challenges in improving reinforcement learning algorithms. Our paper
introduces the LMRL-Gym benchmark for evaluating multi-turn RL for LLMs,
together with an open-source research framework containing a basic toolkit for
getting started on multi-turn RL with offline value-based and policy-based RL
methods. Our benchmark consists of 8 different language tasks, which require
multiple rounds of language interaction and cover a range of tasks in
open-ended dialogue and text games.

<p>Recently, the strong text creation ability of Large Language Models(LLMs) has
given rise to many tools for assisting paper reading or even writing. However,
the weak diagram analysis abilities of LLMs or Multimodal LLMs greatly limit
their application scenarios, especially for scientific academic paper writing.
In this work, towards a more versatile copilot for academic paper writing, we
mainly focus on strengthening the multi-modal diagram analysis ability of
Multimodal LLMs. By parsing Latex source files of high-quality papers, we
carefully build a multi-modal diagram understanding dataset M-Paper. By
aligning diagrams in the paper with related paragraphs, we construct
professional diagram analysis samples for training and evaluation. M-Paper is
the first dataset to support joint comprehension of multiple scientific
diagrams, including figures and tables in the format of images or Latex codes.
Besides, to better align the copilot with the user's intention, we introduce
the `outline' as the control signal, which could be directly given by the user
or revised based on auto-generated ones. Comprehensive experiments with a
state-of-the-art Mumtimodal LLM demonstrate that training on our dataset shows
stronger scientific diagram understanding performance, including diagram
captioning, diagram analysis, and outline recommendation. The dataset, code,

<p>Radiology reports are an instrumental part of modern medicine, informing key
clinical decisions such as diagnosis and treatment. The worldwide shortage of
radiologists, however, restricts access to expert care and imposes heavy
workloads, contributing to avoidable errors and delays in report delivery.
While recent progress in automated report generation with vision-language
models offer clear potential in ameliorating the situation, the path to
real-world adoption has been stymied by the challenge of evaluating the
clinical quality of AI-generated reports. In this study, we build a
state-of-the-art report generation system for chest radiographs, Flamingo-CXR,
by fine-tuning a well-known vision-language foundation model on radiology data.
To evaluate the quality of the AI-generated reports, a group of 16 certified
radiologists provide detailed evaluations of AI-generated and human written
reports for chest X-rays from an intensive care setting in the United States
and an inpatient setting in India. At least one radiologist (out of two per
case) preferred the AI report to the ground truth report in over 60$\%$ of
cases for both datasets. Amongst the subset of AI-generated reports that
contain errors, the most frequently cited reasons were related to the location
and finding, whereas for human written reports, most mistakes were related to
severity and finding. This disparity suggested potential complementarity
between our AI system and human experts, prompting us to develop an assistive
scenario in which Flamingo-CXR generates a first-draft report, which is
subsequently revised by a clinician. This is the first demonstration of
clinician-AI collaboration for report writing, and the resultant reports are
assessed to be equivalent or preferred by at least one radiologist to reports
written by experts alone in 80$\%$ of in-patient cases and 66$\%$ of intensive
care cases.

<p>To precisely evaluate a language model's capability for logical reading
comprehension, we present a dataset for testing the understanding of the
rationale behind critical reasoning. For questions taken from an existing
multiplechoice logical reading comprehension dataset, we crowdsource rationale
texts that explain why we should select or eliminate answer options, resulting
in 3,003 multiple-choice subquestions that are associated with 943 main
questions. Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models
(e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able
to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform
particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options
of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for
explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated. These results
suggest that our dataset encourages further investigation into the critical
reasoning ability of language models while focusing on the elimination process
of relevant alternatives.

<p>Semantic representations of text, i.e. representations of natural language
which capture meaning by geometry, are essential for areas such as information
retrieval and document grouping. High-dimensional trained dense vectors have
received much attention in recent years as such representations. We investigate
the structure of semantic spaces that arise from embeddings made with
Sentence-BERT and find that the representations suffer from a well-known
problem in high dimensions called hubness. Hubness results in asymmetric
neighborhood relations, such that some texts (the hubs) are neighbours of many
other texts while most texts (so-called anti-hubs), are neighbours of few or no
other texts. We quantify the semantic quality of the embeddings using hubness
scores and error rate of a neighbourhood based classifier. We find that when
hubness is high, we can reduce error rate and hubness using hubness reduction
methods. We identify a combination of two methods as resulting in the best
reduction. For example, on one of the tested pretrained models, this combined
method can reduce hubness by about 75% and error rate by about 9%. Thus, we
argue that mitigating hubness in the embedding space provides better semantic
representations of text.

<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by incorporating external knowledge
with parametric memory of language models, has become the state-of-the-art
architecture for open-domain QA tasks. However, common knowledge bases are
inherently constrained by limited coverage and noisy information, making
retrieval-based approaches inadequate to answer implicit reasoning questions.
In this paper, we propose an Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework
that utilizes inductive knowledge along with the retrieved documents for
implicit reasoning. We leverage large language models (LLMs) for deriving such
knowledge via a novel prompting method based on inductive reasoning patterns.
On top of this, we implement two versions of IAG named IAG-GPT and IAG-Student,
respectively. IAG-GPT directly utilizes the knowledge generated by GPT-3 for
answer prediction, while IAG-Student gets rid of dependencies on GPT service at
inference time by incorporating a student inductor model. The inductor is
firstly trained via knowledge distillation and further optimized by
back-propagating the generator feedback via differentiable beam scores.
Experimental results show that IAG outperforms RAG baselines as well as ChatGPT
on two Open-Domain QA tasks. Notably, our best models have won the first place
in the official leaderboards of CSQA2.0 (since Nov 1, 2022) and StrategyQA
(since Jan 8, 2023).

<p>People in conversation entrain their linguistic behaviours through
spontaneous alignment mechanisms [7] - both in face-to-face and
computer-mediated communication (CMC) [8]. In CMC, one of the mechanisms
through which linguistic entrainment happens is through explicit replies.
Indeed, the use of explicit replies influences the structure of conversations,
favouring the formation of reply-trees typically delineated by topic shifts
[5]. The interpersonal coordination mechanisms realized by how actors address
each other have been studied using a probabilistic framework proposed by David
Gibson [2,3]. Other recent approaches use computational methods and information
theory to quantify changes in text. We explore coordination mechanisms
concerned with some of the roles utterances play in dialogues - specifically in
explicit replies. We identify these roles by finding community structure in the
conversation's vocabulary using a non-parametric, hierarchical topic model.
Some conversations may always stay on the ground, remaining at the level of
general introductory chatter. Some others may develop a specific sub-topic in
significant depth and detail. Even others may jump between general chatter,
out-of-topic remarks and people agreeing or disagreeing without further
elaboration.

<p>How much meaning influences gender assignment across languages is an active
area of research in modern linguistics and cognitive science. We can view
current approaches as aiming to determine where gender assignment falls on a
spectrum, from being fully arbitrarily determined to being largely semantically
determined. For the latter case, there is a formulation of the neo-Whorfian
hypothesis, which claims that even inanimate noun gender influences how people
conceive of and talk about objects (using the choice of adjective used to
modify inanimate nouns as a proxy for meaning). We offer a novel, causal
graphical model that jointly represents the interactions between a noun's
grammatical gender, its meaning, and adjective choice. In accordance with past
results, we find a relationship between the gender of nouns and the adjectives
which modify them. However, when we control for the meaning of the noun, we
find that grammatical gender has a near-zero effect on adjective choice,
thereby calling the neo-Whorfian hypothesis into question.

<p>The widespread of generative artificial intelligence has heightened concerns
about the potential harms posed by AI-generated texts, primarily stemming from
factoid, unfair, and toxic content. Previous researchers have invested much
effort in assessing the harmlessness of generative language models. However,
existing benchmarks are struggling in the era of large language models (LLMs),
due to the stronger language generation and instruction following capabilities,
as well as wider applications. In this paper, we propose FFT, a new benchmark
with 2116 elaborated-designed instances, for LLM harmlessness evaluation with
factuality, fairness, and toxicity. To investigate the potential harms of LLMs,
we evaluate 9 representative LLMs covering various parameter scales, training

<p>With the great success of ChatGPT, the research of large language models has
become increasingly popular. However, the models have several limitations, such
as toxicity and pool performance of arithmetic solving. Meanwhile, LLM may have
some potential abilities that have yet to be exploited. In this paper, we
choose a different way to enhance the arithmetic ability of LLM. We propose to
train LLM to generate a postfix expression related to the arithmetic problem
and incorporate it with small pretrained models. Moreover, this small model
transfers the token embeddings into real dense numbers and invokes native
functions of a deep learning platform to get the correct answer. To generate
the final result, we propose prompt injection for adding the result outputs by
the small model to LLM. This work provides different ways of thinking, training
and using a language model. The codes and models will be released at

<p>In light of the rapidly evolving capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), it becomes imperative to develop rigorous domain-specific evaluation
benchmarks to accurately assess their capabilities. In response to this need,
this paper introduces ArcMMLU, a specialized benchmark tailored for the Library
&amp; Information Science (LIS) domain in Chinese. This benchmark aims to measure
the knowledge and reasoning capability of LLMs within four key sub-domains:
Archival Science, Data Science, Library Science, and Information Science.
Following the format of MMLU/CMMLU, we collected over 6,000 high-quality
questions for the compilation of ArcMMLU. This extensive compilation can
reflect the diverse nature of the LIS domain and offer a robust foundation for
LLM evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that while most mainstream
LLMs achieve an average accuracy rate above 50% on ArcMMLU, there remains a
notable performance gap, suggesting substantial headroom for refinement in LLM
capabilities within the LIS domain. Further analysis explores the effectiveness
of few-shot examples on model performance and highlights challenging questions
where models consistently underperform, providing valuable insights for
targeted improvements. ArcMMLU fills a critical gap in LLM evaluations within
the Chinese LIS domain and paves the way for future development of LLMs
tailored to this specialized area.

<p>Conversational AI tools that can generate and discuss clinically correct
radiology reports for a given medical image have the potential to transform
radiology. Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a
collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of
reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly
evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology
report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates
visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language
model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the
underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled,
image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training
with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in
report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as
correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step
toward clinical dialog systems. Our code is available on github:

<p>Since the natural language processing (NLP) community started to make large
language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, act as a critic to evaluate the quality
of generated texts, most of them only train a critique generation model of a
specific scale on specific datasets. We argue that a comprehensive
investigation on the key factor of LLM-based evaluation models, such as scaling
properties, is lacking, so that it is still inconclusive whether these models
have potential to replace GPT-4's evaluation in practical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a new critique generation model called CritiqueLLM, which
includes a dialogue-based prompting method for high-quality referenced /
reference-free evaluation data. Experimental results show that our model can
achieve comparable evaluation performance to GPT-4 especially in system-level
correlations, and even outperform GPT-4 in 3 out of 8 tasks in a challenging
reference-free setting. We conduct detailed analysis to show promising scaling
properties of our model in the quality of generated critiques. We also
demonstrate that our generated critiques can act as scalable feedback to
directly improve the generation quality of LLMs.

<p>In this paper, we observe and address the challenges of the coordination
recognition task. Most existing methods rely on syntactic parsers to identify
the coordinators in a sentence and detect the coordination boundaries. However,
state-of-the-art syntactic parsers are slow and suffer from errors, especially
for long and complicated sentences. To better solve the problems, we propose a
pipeline model COordination RECognizer (CoRec). It consists of two components:
coordinator identifier and conjunct boundary detector. The experimental results
on datasets from various domains demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of the proposed method. Further experiments show that CoRec positively impacts
downstream tasks, improving the yield of state-of-the-art Open IE models.

<p>We extend JAX with the capability to automatically differentiate higher-order
functions (functionals and operators). By representing functions as a
generalization of arrays, we seamlessly use JAX's existing primitive system to
implement higher-order functions. We present a set of primitive operators that
serve as foundational building blocks for constructing several key types of
functionals. For every introduced primitive operator, we derive and implement
both linearization and transposition rules, aligning with JAX's internal
protocols for forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation. This
enhancement allows for functional differentiation in the same syntax
traditionally use for functions. The resulting functional gradients are
themselves functions ready to be invoked in python. We showcase this tool's
efficacy and simplicity through applications where functional derivatives are
indispensable. The source code of this work is released at

<p>The current leading paradigm for temporal information extraction from text
consists of three phases: (1) recognition of events and temporal expressions,
(2) recognition of temporal relations among them, and (3) time-line
construction from the temporal relations. In contrast to the first two phases,
the last phase, time-line construction, received little attention and is the
focus of this work. In this paper, we propose a new method to construct a
linear time-line from a set of (extracted) temporal relations. But more
importantly, we propose a novel paradigm in which we directly predict start and
end-points for events from the text, constituting a time-line without going
through the intermediate step of prediction of temporal relations as in earlier
work. Within this paradigm, we propose two models that predict in linear
complexity, and a new training loss using TimeML-style annotations, yielding
promising results.

<p>Multi-turn response selection is a task designed for developing dialogue
agents. The performance on this task has a remarkable improvement with
pre-trained language models. However, these models simply concatenate the turns
in dialogue history as the input and largely ignore the dependencies between
the turns. In this paper, we propose a dialogue extraction algorithm to
transform a dialogue history into threads based on their dependency relations.
Each thread can be regarded as a self-contained sub-dialogue. We also propose
Thread-Encoder model to encode threads and candidates into compact
representations by pre-trained Transformers and finally get the matching score
through an attention layer. The experiments show that dependency relations are
helpful for dialogue context understanding, and our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines on both DSTC7 and DSTC8*, with competitive results
on UbuntuV2.

<p>This paper addresses the task of generating fluent descriptions by training
on a non-uniform combination of data sources, containing both human-annotated
and web-collected captions. Large-scale datasets with noisy image-text pairs,
indeed, provide a sub-optimal source of supervision because of their
low-quality descriptive style, while human-annotated datasets are cleaner but
smaller in scale. To get the best of both worlds, we propose to leverage and
separate semantics and descriptive style through the incorporation of a style
token and keywords extracted through a retrieval component. The proposed model
avoids the need of object detectors, is trained with a single objective of
prompt language modeling, and can replicate the style of human-collected
captions while training on sources with different input styles. Experimentally,
the model shows a strong capability of recognizing real-world concepts and
producing high-quality captions. Extensive experiments are performed on
different image captioning datasets, including CC3M, nocaps, and the

<p>This paper presents an experiment of automatically scoring handwritten
descriptive answers in the trial tests for the new Japanese university entrance
examination, which were made for about 120,000 examinees in 2017 and 2018.
There are about 400,000 answers with more than 20 million characters. Although
all answers have been scored by human examiners, handwritten characters are not
labeled. We present our attempt to adapt deep neural network-based handwriting
recognizers trained on a labeled handwriting dataset into this unlabeled answer
set. Our proposed method combines different training strategies, ensembles
multiple recognizers, and uses a language model built from a large general
corpus to avoid overfitting into specific data. In our experiment, the proposed
method records character accuracy of over 97% using about 2,000 verified
labeled answers that account for less than 0.5% of the dataset. Then, the
recognized answers are fed into a pre-trained automatic scoring system based on
the BERT model without correcting misrecognized characters and providing rubric
annotations. The automatic scoring system achieves from 0.84 to 0.98 of
Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). As QWK is over 0.8, it represents an acceptable
similarity of scoring between the automatic scoring system and the human
examiners. These results are promising for further research on end-to-end
automatic scoring of descriptive answers.

<p>Transformer-based language models have been shown to be highly effective for
several NLP tasks. In this paper, we consider three transformer models, BERT,
RoBERTa, and XLNet, in both small and large versions, and investigate how
faithful their representations are with respect to the semantic content of
texts. We formalize a notion of semantic faithfulness, in which the semantic
content of a text should causally figure in a model's inferences in question
answering. We then test this notion by observing a model's behavior on
answering questions about a story after performing two novel semantic
interventions: deletion intervention and negation intervention. While
transformer models achieve high performance on standard question answering
tasks, we show that they fail to be semantically faithful once we perform these
interventions for a significant number of cases (~50% for deletion
intervention, and ~20% drop in accuracy for negation intervention). We then
propose an intervention-based training regime that can mitigate the undesirable
effects for deletion intervention by a significant margin (from ~ 50% to ~6%).
We analyze the inner-workings of the models to better understand the
effectiveness of intervention-based training for deletion intervention. But we
show that this training does not attenuate other aspects of semantic
unfaithfulness such as the models' inability to deal with negation intervention
or to capture the predicate-argument structure of texts. We also test
InstructGPT, via prompting, for its ability to handle the two interventions and
to capture predicate-argument structure. While InstructGPT models do achieve
very high performance on predicate-argument structure task, they fail to
respond adequately to our deletion and negation interventions.

<p>Large language models are becoming increasingly pervasive and ubiquitous in
society via deployment in sociotechnical systems. Yet these language models, be
it for classification or generation, have been shown to be biased and behave
irresponsibly, causing harm to people at scale. It is crucial to audit these
language models rigorously. Existing auditing tools leverage either or both
humans and AI to find failures. In this work, we draw upon literature in
human-AI collaboration and sensemaking, and conduct interviews with research
experts in safe and fair AI, to build upon the auditing tool: AdaTest (Ribeiro
and Lundberg, 2022), which is powered by a generative large language model
(LLM). Through the design process we highlight the importance of sensemaking
and human-AI communication to leverage complementary strengths of humans and
generative models in collaborative auditing. To evaluate the effectiveness of
the augmented tool, AdaTest++, we conduct user studies with participants
auditing two commercial language models: OpenAI's GPT-3 and Azure's sentiment

human strengths such as schematization, hypothesis formation and testing.
Further, with our tool, participants identified a variety of failures modes,

<p>Text-based games (TGs) are language-based interactive environments for
reinforcement learning. While language models (LMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs)
are commonly used for handling large action space in TGs, it is unclear whether
these techniques are necessary or overused. In this paper, we revisit the
challenge of exploring the action space in TGs and propose $
\epsilon$-admissible exploration, a minimal approach of utilizing admissible
actions, for training phase. Additionally, we present a text-based actor-critic
(TAC) agent that produces textual commands for game, solely from game
observations, without requiring any KG or LM. Our method, on average across 10
games from Jericho, outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art agents
that use LM and KG. Our approach highlights that a much lighter model design,
with a fresh perspective on utilizing the information within the environments,
suffices for an effective exploration of exponentially large action spaces.

<p>Recent studies have shown promising results on utilizing large pre-trained
image-language models for video question answering. While these image-language
models can efficiently bootstrap the representation learning of video-language
models, they typically concatenate uniformly sampled video frames as visual
inputs without explicit language-aware, temporal modeling. When only a portion
of a video input is relevant to the language query, such uniform frame sampling
can often lead to missing important visual cues. Although humans often find a
video moment to focus on and rewind the moment to answer questions, training a
query-aware video moment localizer often requires expensive annotations and
high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Self-Chained Video
Localization-Answering (SeViLA), a novel framework that leverages a single
image-language model (BLIP-2) to tackle both temporal keyframe localization and
QA on videos. SeViLA framework consists of two modules: Localizer and Answerer,
where both are parameter-efficiently fine-tuned from BLIP-2. We propose two
ways of chaining these modules for cascaded inference and self-refinement.
First, in the forward chain, the Localizer finds multiple language-aware
keyframes in a video, which the Answerer uses to predict the answer. Second, in
the reverse chain, the Answerer generates keyframe pseudo-labels to refine the
Localizer, alleviating the need for expensive video moment localization
annotations. Our SeViLA framework outperforms several strong baselines on 5
challenging video QA and event prediction benchmarks, and achieves the
state-of-the-art in both fine-tuning (NExT-QA, STAR) and zero-shot (NExT-QA,
STAR, How2QA, VLEP) settings. We also analyze the impact of Localizer,
comparisons of Localizer with other temporal localization models,
pre-training/self-refinement of Localizer, and varying the number of keyframes.

<p>Despite the ability to train capable LLMs, the methodology for maintaining
their relevancy and rectifying errors remains elusive. To this end, the past
few years have witnessed a surge in techniques for editing LLMs, the objective
of which is to efficiently alter the behavior of LLMs within a specific domain
without negatively impacting performance across other inputs. This paper
embarks on a deep exploration of the problems, methods, and opportunities
related to model editing for LLMs. In particular, we provide an exhaustive
overview of the task definition and challenges associated with model editing,
along with an in-depth empirical analysis of the most progressive methods
currently at our disposal. We also build a new benchmark dataset to facilitate
a more robust evaluation and pinpoint enduring issues intrinsic to existing
techniques. Our objective is to provide valuable insights into the
effectiveness and feasibility of each editing technique, thereby assisting the
community in making informed decisions on the selection of the most appropriate
method for a specific task or context. Code and datasets are available at

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14993">Controlling Pre-trained Language Models for Grade-Specific Text Simplification. (arXiv:2305.14993v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Text simplification (TS) systems rewrite text to make it more readable while
preserving its content. However, what makes a text easy to read depends on the
intended readers. Recent work has shown that pre-trained language models can
simplify text using a wealth of techniques to control output simplicity,
ranging from specifying only the desired reading grade level, to directly
specifying low-level edit operations. Yet it remains unclear how to set these
control parameters in practice. Existing approaches set them at the corpus
level, disregarding the complexity of individual inputs and considering only
one level of output complexity. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
understand how different control mechanisms impact the adequacy and simplicity
of text simplification systems. Based on these insights, we introduce a simple
method that predicts the edit operations required for simplifying a text for a
specific grade level on an instance-per-instance basis. This approach improves
the quality of the simplified outputs over corpus-level search-based
heuristics.

<p>Though LLMs are capable of generating plausible programs, it's challenging to
interact with the LLMs further to revise the program, especially if the user's
specific requirements are different from the initial proposal. In this paper,
we introduce ANPL, an interactive programming system that ensures users can
always refine the generated code towards their specific programmatic intents
via structured decompositions. Borrowing the paradigm of sketching from program
synthesis, an ANPL program consists of a set of input-outputs that it must
satisfy, a ``sketch'' -- control/data flow expressed in precise code (e.g.
Python), and ``holes'' -- sub-modules to be implemented by the LLM specified
with natural language. The user revises an ANPL program by either modifying the
sketch, changing the language used to describe the holes, or providing
additional input-outputs to a particular hole, turning it into a sub-ANPL
program that can be solved recursively. This workflow allows the users to
offload programming burdens to the LLM as much as possible while retaining the
ability to pinpoint and resolve bugs locally, without exposing the rest of the
program to the LLM. We deploy ANPL on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus
(ARC), a set of unique tasks that are challenging for state-of-the-art AI
systems, showing it outperforms baseline programming systems that (a) without
the ability to decompose tasks interactively and (b) without the guarantee that
the modules can be correctly composed together. Additional evaluations on APPS,
HumanEval, and real-world programming tasks have validated that the ANPL
framework is applicable to multiple programming domains. We release the ANPL
solutions to the ARC tasks as a dataset, providing insights into how humans
decompose novel tasks programmatically. See our code at

<p>Temperature sampling is a conventional approach to diversify large language
model predictions. As temperature increases, the prediction becomes diverse but
also vulnerable to hallucinations -- generating tokens that are sensible but
not factual. One common approach to mitigate hallucinations is to provide
source/grounding documents and the model is trained to produce predictions that
bind to and are attributable to the provided source. It appears that there is a
trade-off between diversity and attribution. To mitigate any such trade-off, we
propose to relax the constraint of having a fixed temperature over decoding
steps, and a mechanism to guide the dynamic temperature according to its
relevance to the source through KL-divergence. Our experiments justifies the
trade-off, and shows that our sampling algorithm outperforms the conventional
top-k and top-p algorithms in conversational question-answering and
summarization tasks.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07384">Probing Quantifier Comprehension in Large Language Models: Another Example of Inverse Scaling. (arXiv:2306.07384v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gupta_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Akshat Gupta</a></p>
<p>With their increasing size, large language models (LLMs) are becoming
increasingly good at language understanding tasks. But even with high
performance on specific downstream task, LLMs fail at simple linguistic tests
for negation or quantifier understanding. Previous work on quantifier
understanding in LLMs show inverse scaling in understanding few-type
quantifiers. In this paper, we question the claims of of previous work and show
that it is a result of inappropriate testing methodology. We also present
alternate methods to measure quantifier comprehension in LLMs and show that
LLMs are able to better understand the difference between the meaning of
few-type and most-type quantifiers as their size increases, although they are
not particularly good at it. We also observe inverse scaling for most-type
quantifier understanding, which is contrary to human psycho-linguistic
experiments and previous work, where the model's understanding of most-type
quantifier gets worse as the model size increases. We do this evaluation on
models ranging from 125M-175B parameters, which suggests that LLMs do not do as
well as expected with quantifiers. We also discuss the possible reasons for
this and the relevance of quantifier understanding in evaluating language
understanding in LLMs.

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable task-handling
capabilities and innovative outputs, have catalyzed significant advancements
across a spectrum of fields. However, their proficiency within specialized
domains such as biomolecular studies remains limited. To address this
challenge, we introduce Mol-Instructions, a comprehensive instruction dataset
designed for the biomolecular domain. Mol-Instructions encompasses three key
components: molecule-oriented instructions, protein-oriented instructions, and
biomolecular text instructions. Each component aims to improve the
understanding and prediction capabilities of LLMs concerning biomolecular
features and behaviors. Through extensive instruction tuning experiments on
LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Mol-Instructions in enhancing large
models' performance in the intricate realm of biomolecular studies, thus
fostering progress in the biomolecular research community. Mol-Instructions is
publicly available for ongoing research and will undergo regular updates to
enhance its applicability.

<p>Text-guided image editing is widely needed in daily life, ranging from
personal use to professional applications such as Photoshop. However, existing
methods are either zero-shot or trained on an automatically synthesized
dataset, which contains a high volume of noise. Thus, they still require lots
of manual tuning to produce desirable outcomes in practice. To address this
issue, we introduce MagicBrush (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/MagicBrush/),
the first large-scale, manually annotated dataset for instruction-guided real
image editing that covers diverse scenarios: single-turn, multi-turn,
mask-provided, and mask-free editing. MagicBrush comprises over 10K manually
annotated triplets (source image, instruction, target image), which supports
trainining large-scale text-guided image editing models. We fine-tune
InstructPix2Pix on MagicBrush and show that the new model can produce much
better images according to human evaluation. We further conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate current image editing baselines from multiple
dimensions including quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations. The
results reveal the challenging nature of our dataset and the gap between
current baselines and real-world editing needs.

<p>Large language models have an exceptional capability to incorporate new
information in a contextual manner. However, the full potential of such an
approach is often restrained due to a limitation in the effective context
length. One solution to this issue is to endow an attention layer with access
to an external memory, which comprises of (key, value) pairs. Yet, as the
number of documents increases, the proportion of relevant keys to irrelevant
ones decreases, leading the model to focus more on the irrelevant keys. We
identify a significant challenge, dubbed the distraction issue, where keys
linked to different semantic values might overlap, making them hard to
distinguish. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Focused Transformer
(FoT), a technique that employs a training process inspired by contrastive
learning. This novel approach enhances the structure of the (key, value) space,
enabling an extension of the context length. Our method allows for fine-tuning
pre-existing, large-scale models to lengthen their effective context. This is
demonstrated by our fine-tuning of $3B$ and $7B$ OpenLLaMA checkpoints. The
resulting models, which we name LongLLaMA, exhibit advancements in tasks
requiring a long context. We further illustrate that our LongLLaMA models
adeptly manage a $256 k$ context length for passkey retrieval.

<p>Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale datasets have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities on downstream tasks when fine-tuned with
minimal data. However, many VLMs rely on proprietary data and are not
open-source, which restricts the use of white-box approaches for fine-tuning.
As such, we aim to develop a black-box approach to optimize VLMs through
natural language prompts, thereby avoiding the need to access model parameters,
feature embeddings, or even output logits. We propose employing chat-based LLMs
to search for the best text prompt for VLMs. Specifically, we adopt an
automatic hill-climbing procedure that converges to an effective prompt by
evaluating the performance of current prompts and asking LLMs to refine them
based on textual feedback, all within a conversational process without
human-in-the-loop. In a challenging 1-shot image classification setup, our
simple approach surpasses the white-box continuous prompting method (CoOp) by
an average of 1.5% across 11 datasets including ImageNet. Our approach also
outperforms both human-engineered and LLM-generated prompts. We highlight the
advantage of conversational feedback that incorporates both positive and
negative prompts, suggesting that LLMs can utilize the implicit gradient
direction in textual feedback for a more efficient search. In addition, we find
that the text prompts generated through our strategy are not only more
interpretable but also transfer well across different VLM architectures in a
black-box manner. Lastly, we demonstrate our framework on a state-of-the-art
black-box VLM (DALL-E 3) for text-to-image optimization.

<p>Some of the most powerful language models currently are proprietary systems,
accessible only via (typically restrictive) web or software programming
interfaces. This is the Language-Models-as-a-Service (LMaaS) paradigm. In
contrast with scenarios where full model access is available, as in the case of
open-source models, such closed-off language models present specific challenges
for evaluating, benchmarking, and testing them. This paper has two goals: on
the one hand, we delineate how the aforementioned challenges act as impediments
to the accessibility, replicability, reliability, and trustworthiness of LMaaS.
We systematically examine the issues that arise from a lack of information
about language models for each of these four aspects. We conduct a detailed
analysis of existing solutions and put forth a number of considered
recommendations, and highlight the directions for future advancements. On the
other hand, it serves as a comprehensive resource for existing knowledge on

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across
various domains. To further advance LLMs, we propose 'SELF' (Self-Evolution
with Language Feedback), a novel approach that enables LLMs to self-improve
through self-reflection, akin to human learning processes. SELF initiates with
a meta-skill learning process that equips the LLMs with capabilities for
self-feedback and self-refinement. Subsequently, the model undergoes an
iterative process of self-evolution. In each iteration, it utilizes an
unlabeled dataset of instructions to generate initial responses. These
responses are enhanced through self-feedback and self-refinement. The model is
then fine-tuned using this enhanced data. The model undergoes progressive
improvement through this iterative self-evolution process. Moreover, the SELF
framework enables the model to apply self-refinement during inference, which
further improves response quality. Our experiments in mathematics and general
tasks demonstrate that SELF can enhance the capabilities of LLMs without human
intervention. The SELF framework indicates a promising direction for the
autonomous evolution of LLMs, transitioning them from passive information
receivers to active participants in their development.

<p>The scientific scale-up of large language models (LLMs) necessitates a
comprehensive understanding of their scaling properties. However, the existing
literature on the scaling properties only yields an incomplete answer:
optimization loss decreases predictably as the model size increases, in line
with established scaling law; yet no scaling law for task has been established
and the task performances are far from predictable during scaling. Task
performances typically show minor gains on small models until they improve
dramatically once models exceed a size threshold, exemplifying the ``emergent
abilities''. In this study, we discover that small models, although they
exhibit minor performance, demonstrate critical and consistent task performance
improvements that are not captured by conventional evaluation strategies due to
insufficient measurement resolution. To measure such improvements, we introduce
PassUntil, an evaluation strategy with theoretically infinite resolution,
through massive sampling in the decoding phase. With PassUntil, we conduct a
quantitative investigation into the scaling law of task performance. The
investigation contains two parts. Firstly, a strict task scaling law that is
not conventionally known to exist, is identified, enhancing the predictability
of task performances. Remarkably, we are able to predict the performance of the
2.4B model on code generation with merely 0.05\% deviation before training
starts, which is the first systematic attempt to verify predictable scaling
proposed by GPT-4's report. Secondly, we are able to study emergent abilities
quantitatively. We identify a kind of accelerated emergence whose scaling curve
cannot be fitted by standard scaling law function and has a increasing speed.
We then examine two hypothesis and imply that the ``multiple circuits
hypothesis'' might be responsible for the accelerated emergence.

phenomenon with little understanding. To explain ICL, recent studies try to
shed light on ICL by connecting it to Gradient Descent (GD). However, the
question is, do these hold up in practice in actual pre-trained models?
</p>
<p>We highlight the limiting assumptions in prior works that make their context
considerably different from the practical context in which language models are
trained. For example, the theoretical hand-constructed weights used in these
studies have properties that don't match those of real LLMs. Furthermore, their
experimental verification uses \emph{ICL objective} (training models explicitly
for ICL), which differs from the emergent ICL in the wild.
</p>
<p>We also look for evidence in real models. We observe that ICL and GD have
different sensitivity to the order in which they observe demonstrations.
Finally, we probe and compare the ICL vs. GD hypothesis in a natural setting.
We conduct comprehensive empirical analyses on language models pre-trained on
natural data (LLaMa-7B). Our comparisons of three performance metrics highlight
the inconsistent behavior of ICL and GD as a function of various factors such
as datasets, models, and the number of demonstrations. We observe that ICL and
GD modify the output distribution of language models differently. These results
indicate that the equivalence between ICL and GD remains an open hypothesis and
calls for further studies.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot abstractive summarization
tasks, delivering fluent and pertinent summaries. Recent advancements have
extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, surpassing token
limits of 100k. However, in the realm of multi-document question answering,
language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to
favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance
pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias
raises concerns, particularly in summarization tasks where crucial content may
be dispersed throughout the source document(s). This paper presents a
comprehensive investigation encompassing 10 datasets, 5 LLMs, and 5 evaluation
metrics to analyze how these models leverage their input for abstractive
summarization. Our findings reveal a pronounced bias towards the introductory
content (and to a lesser extent, the final content), posing challenges for LLM
performance across a range of diverse summarization benchmarks.

<p>Numerous studies have highlighted the privacy risks associated with
pretrained large language models. In contrast, our research offers a unique
perspective by demonstrating that pretrained large language models can
effectively contribute to privacy preservation. We propose a locally
differentially private mechanism called DP-Prompt, which leverages the power of
pretrained large language models and zero-shot prompting to counter author
de-anonymization attacks while minimizing the impact on downstream utility.
When DP-Prompt is used with a powerful language model like ChatGPT (gpt-3.5),
we observe a notable reduction in the success rate of de-anonymization attacks,
showing that it surpasses existing approaches by a considerable margin despite
its simpler design. For instance, in the case of the IMDB dataset, DP-Prompt
(with ChatGPT) perfectly recovers the clean sentiment F1 score while achieving
a 46\% reduction in author identification F1 score against static attackers and
a 26\% reduction against adaptive attackers. We conduct extensive experiments
across six open-source large language models, ranging up to 7 billion
parameters, to analyze various effects of the privacy-utility tradeoff.

<p>Documentation burden is a major contributor to clinician burnout, which is
rising nationally and is an urgent threat to our ability to care for patients.
Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, could reduce clinician
burden by assisting with documentation. Although many hospitals are actively
integrating such systems into electronic medical record systems, AI chatbots
utility and impact on clinical decision-making have not been studied for this
intended use. We are the first to examine the utility of large language models
in assisting clinicians draft responses to patient questions. In our two-stage
cross-sectional study, 6 oncologists responded to 100 realistic synthetic
cancer patient scenarios and portal messages developed to reflect common
medical situations, first manually, then with AI assistance.
</p>
<p>We find AI-assisted responses were longer, less readable, but provided
acceptable drafts without edits 58% of time. AI assistance improved efficiency
77% of time, with low harm risk (82% safe). However, 7.7% unedited AI responses
could severely harm. In 31% cases, physicians thought AI drafts were
human-written. AI assistance led to more patient education recommendations,
fewer clinical actions than manual responses. Results show promise for AI to
improve clinician efficiency and patient care through assisting documentation,
if used judiciously. Monitoring model outputs and human-AI interaction remains
crucial for safe implementation.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17940">Unified Segment-to-Segment Framework for Simultaneous Sequence Generation. (arXiv:2310.17940v4 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Simultaneous sequence generation is a pivotal task for real-time scenarios,
such as streaming speech recognition, simultaneous machine translation and
simultaneous speech translation, where the target sequence is generated while
receiving the source sequence. The crux of achieving high-quality generation
with low latency lies in identifying the optimal moments for generating,
accomplished by learning a mapping between the source and target sequences.
However, existing methods often rely on task-specific heuristics for different
sequence types, limiting the model's capacity to adaptively learn the
source-target mapping and hindering the exploration of multi-task learning for
various simultaneous tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified
segment-to-segment framework (Seg2Seg) for simultaneous sequence generation,
which learns the mapping in an adaptive and unified manner. During the process
of simultaneous generation, the model alternates between waiting for a source
segment and generating a target segment, making the segment serve as the
natural bridge between the source and target. To accomplish this, Seg2Seg
introduces a latent segment as the pivot between source to target and explores
all potential source-target mappings via the proposed expectation training,
thereby learning the optimal moments for generating. Experiments on multiple
simultaneous generation tasks demonstrate that Seg2Seg achieves
state-of-the-art performance and exhibits better generality across various
tasks.

<p>As large language models (LLMs) become more capable, there is growing
excitement about the possibility of using LLMs as proxies for humans in
real-world tasks where subjective labels are desired, such as in surveys and
opinion polling. One widely-cited barrier to the adoption of LLMs is their
sensitivity to prompt wording - but interestingly, humans also display
sensitivities to instruction changes in the form of response biases. As such,
we argue that if LLMs are going to be used to approximate human opinions, it is
necessary to investigate the extent to which LLMs also reflect human response
biases, if at all. In this work, we use survey design as a case study, where
human response biases caused by permutations in wordings of "prompts" have been
extensively studied. Drawing from prior work in social psychology, we design a
dataset and propose a framework to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit human-like
response biases in survey questionnaires. Our comprehensive evaluation of nine
models shows that popular open and commercial LLMs generally fail to reflect
human-like behavior. These inconsistencies tend to be more prominent in models
that have been instruction fine-tuned. Furthermore, even if a model shows a
significant change in the same direction as humans, we find that perturbations
that are not meant to elicit significant changes in humans may also result in a
similar change. These results highlight the potential pitfalls of using LLMs to
substitute humans in parts of the annotation pipeline, and further underscore
the importance of finer-grained characterizations of model behavior. Our code,

<p>Adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for their safe
and responsible deployment. We introduce a novel approach for automated
generation of adversarial evaluation datasets to test the safety of LLM
generations on new downstream applications. We call it AI-assisted Red-Teaming
(AART) - an automated alternative to current manual red-teaming efforts. AART
offers a data generation and augmentation pipeline of reusable and customizable
recipes that reduce human effort significantly and enable integration of
adversarial testing earlier in new product development. AART generates
evaluation datasets with high diversity of content characteristics critical for
effective adversarial testing (e.g. sensitive and harmful concepts, specific to
a wide range of cultural and geographic regions and application scenarios). The
data generation is steered by AI-assisted recipes to define, scope and
prioritize diversity within the application context. This feeds into a
structured LLM-generation process that scales up evaluation priorities.
Compared to some state-of-the-art tools, AART shows promising results in terms
of concept coverage and data quality.

<p>Foundation models, specifically Large Language Models (LLM's), have lately
gained wide-spread attention and adoption. Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model to capture desired behaviors,
which is then used to align an LLM. These reward models are additionally used
at inference-time to estimate how well LLM responses adhere to those desired
behaviors. However, there is little work measuring how robust these reward
models are to distribution shifts. In this work, we evaluate how reward model
performance - measured via accuracy and calibration (i.e. alignment between
accuracy and confidence) - is affected by distribution shift. We show novel
calibration patterns and accuracy drops due to OOD prompts and responses, and
that the reward model is more sensitive to shifts in responses than prompts.
Additionally, we adapt an OOD detection technique commonly used in
classification to the reward model setting in order to detect these
distribution shifts in prompts and responses.

of work is no exception: the potential of LLM-based tools to assist in the
daily work of scientists has become a highly discussed topic across
disciplines. However, we are only at the very onset of this subject of study.
It is still unclear how the potential of LLMs will materialise in research
practice. With this study, we give first empirical evidence on the use of LLMs
in the research process. We have investigated a set of use cases for LLM-based
tools in scientific research, and conducted a first study to assess to which
degree current tools are helpful. In this paper we report specifically on use
cases related to software engineering, such as generating application code and
developing scripts for data analytics. While we studied seemingly simple use
cases, results across tools differ significantly. Our results highlight the

<p>Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT, have been widely adopted in
natural language processing (NLP) due to their exceptional performance.
However, recent studies show their vulnerability to textual adversarial attacks
where the model's output can be misled by intentionally manipulating the text
inputs. Despite various methods that have been proposed to enhance the model's
robustness and mitigate this vulnerability, many require heavy consumption
resources (e.g., adversarial training) or only provide limited protection
(e.g., defensive dropout). In this paper, we propose a novel method called
dynamic attention, tailored for the transformer architecture, to enhance the
inherent robustness of the model itself against various adversarial attacks.
Our method requires no downstream task knowledge and does not incur additional
costs. The proposed dynamic attention consists of two modules: (I) attention
rectification, which masks or weakens the attention value of the chosen tokens,
and (ii) dynamic modeling, which dynamically builds the set of candidate
tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic attention significantly
mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks, improving up to 33\% better
performance than previous methods against widely-used adversarial attacks. The
model-level design of dynamic attention enables it to be easily combined with
other defense methods (e.g., adversarial training) to further enhance the
model's robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic attention
preserves the state-of-the-art robustness space of the original model compared
to other dynamic modeling methods.

<p>In this study, we delve into the realm of counterfactual reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our primary objective is to
cultivate the counterfactual thought processes within LLMs and rigorously
assess these processes for their validity. Specifically, we introduce a novel
task, Counterfactual Logical Modification (CLOMO), and a high-quality
human-annotated benchmark. In this task, LLMs must adeptly alter a given
argumentative text to uphold a predetermined logical relationship. To
effectively evaluate a generation model's counterfactual capabilities, we
propose an innovative evaluation metric, the LogicAware Counterfactual Score to
directly evaluate the natural language output of LLMs instead of modeling the
task as a multiple-choice problem. Analysis shows that the proposed automatic
metric aligns well with human preference. Our experimental results show that
while LLMs demonstrate a notable capacity for logical counterfactual thinking,
there remains a discernible gap between their current abilities and human
performance.

<p>Hallucinations and unfaithful synthesis due to inaccurate prompts with
insufficient semantic details are widely observed in multimodal generative
models. A prevalent strategy to align multiple modalities is to fine-tune the
generator with a large number of annotated text-image pairs. However, such a
procedure is labor-consuming and resource-draining. The key question we ask is:
can we enhance the quality and faithfulness of text-driven generative models
beyond extensive text-image pair annotations? To address this question, we
propose Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a zero-shot framework that
iteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce reliable
visual content. Instead of training generators to handle generic prompts, KPP
employs a recursive knowledge query process to gather informative external
facts from the knowledge base, instructs a language model to compress the
acquired knowledge for prompt refinement, and utilizes text-driven generators
for visual synthesis. The entire process is zero-shot, without accessing the
architectures and parameters of generative models. We evaluate the framework
across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D rendering, and video)
on datasets of different domains. We further demonstrate the extensibility and
adaptability of KPP through varying foundation model bases and instructions.
Our results show that KPP is capable of generating faithful and semantically
rich content across diverse visual domains, offering a promising solution to
improve multimodal generative models.
