<p><b>Authors:</b> Saher Mohamed, Kirollos Farah, Abdelrahman Lotfy, Kareem Rizk, Abdelrahman Saeed, Shahenda Mohamed, Ghada Khouriba, Tamer Arafa</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs are an efficient method for representing and connecting information across various concepts, useful in reasoning, question answering, and knowledge base completion tasks. They organize data by linking points, enabling researchers to combine diverse information sources into a single database. This interdisciplinary approach helps uncover new research questions and ideas. Knowledge graphs create a web of data points (nodes) and their connections (edges), which enhances navigation, comprehension, and utilization of data for multiple purposes. They capture complex relationships inherent in unstructured data sources, offering a semantic framework for diverse entities and their attributes. Strategies for developing knowledge graphs include using seed data, named entity recognition, and relationship extraction. These graphs enhance chatbot accuracy and include multimedia data for richer information. Creating high-quality knowledge graphs involves both automated methods and human oversight, essential for accurate and comprehensive data representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Pichat William Pogrund, Armanush Gasparian, Paloma Pichat, Samuel Demarchi, Michael Veillet-Guillem, Martin Corbet, Th\'eo Dasilva</p>
<p>Abstract: This article investigates, within the field of neuropsychology of artificial intelligence, the process of categorical segmentation performed by language models. This process involves, across different neural layers, the creation of new functional categorical dimensions to analyze the input textual data and perform the required tasks. Each neuron in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network is associated with a specific category, generated by three factors carried by the neural aggregation function: categorical priming, categorical attention, and categorical phasing. At each new layer, these factors govern the formation of new categories derived from the categories of precursor neurons. Through a process of categorical clipping, these new categories are created by selectively extracting specific subdimensions from the preceding categories, constructing a distinction between a form and a categorical background. We explore several cognitive characteristics of this synthetic clipping in an exploratory manner: categorical reduction, categorical selectivity, separation of initial embedding dimensions, and segmentation of categorical zones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal Kesseli, Peter O'Hearn, Ricardo Silveira Cabral</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to formalise and solve search-based problems using large language models, which significantly improves upon previous state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on the logic puzzles benchmark ZebraLogicBench. Instead of letting the LLM attempt to directly solve the puzzles, our method prompts the model to formalise the problem in a logic-focused domain-specific language (DSL) called Logic.py. This formalised representation is then solved using a constraint solver, leveraging the strengths of both the language model and the solver. Our approach achieves a remarkable 65% absolute improvement over the baseline performance of Llama 3.1 70B on ZebraLogicBench, setting a new state-of-the-art with an accuracy of over 90%. This significant advancement demonstrates the potential of combining language models with domain-specific languages and auxiliary tools on traditionally challenging tasks for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Wang, Fafa Zhang, Chaoxu Mu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Criteria Decision Making~(MCDM) is widely applied in various fields, using quantitative and qualitative analyses of multiple levels and attributes to support decision makers in making scientific and rational decisions in complex scenarios. However, traditional MCDM methods face bottlenecks in high-dimensional problems. Given the fact that Large Language Models~(LLMs) achieve impressive performance in various complex tasks, but limited work evaluates LLMs in specific MCDM problems with the help of human domain experts, we further explore the capability of LLMs by proposing an LLM-based evaluation framework to automatically deal with general complex MCDM problems. Within the framework, we assess the performance of various typical open-source models, as well as commercial models such as Claude and ChatGPT, on 3 important applications, these models can only achieve around 60\% accuracy rate compared to the evaluation ground truth. Upon incorporation of Chain-of-Thought or few-shot prompting, the accuracy rates rise to around 70\%, and highly depend on the model. In order to further improve the performance, a LoRA-based fine-tuning technique is employed. The experimental results show that the accuracy rates for different applications improve significantly to around 95\%, and the performance difference is trivial between different models, indicating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LLMs exhibit significant and stable advantages in addressing MCDM tasks and can provide human-expert-level solutions to a wide range of MCDM challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Willy Chan, Michael Souliman, Jakob Nordhagen, Brando Miranda, Elyas Obbad, Kai Fronsdal Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical language into formal specifications and proofs remains a difficult task for state-of-the-art (large) language models. Existing works point to competing explanations for the performance gap. To this end, we introduce a novel methodology that leverages back-translation with hand-curated prompts to enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models, particularly addressing the challenge posed by the scarcity of labeled data. Specifically, we evaluate three primary variations of this strategy: (1) on-the-fly (online) backtranslation, (2) distilled (offline) backtranslation with few-shot amplification, and (3) line-by-line proof analysis integrated with proof state information. Each variant is designed to optimize data quality over quantity, focusing on the high fidelity of generated proofs rather than sheer data scale. Our findings provide evidence that employing our proposed approaches to generate synthetic data, which prioritizes quality over volume, improves the Autoformalization performance of LLMs as measured by standard benchmarks such as ProofNet. Crucially, our approach outperforms pretrained models using a minimal number of tokens. We also show, through strategic prompting and backtranslation, that our approaches surpass the performance of fine-tuning with extensive multilingual datasets such as MMA on ProofNet with only 1/150th of the tokens. Taken together, our methods show a promising new approach to significantly reduce the resources required to formalize proofs, thereby accelerating AI for math.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15820">Universal AI maximizes Variational Empowerment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Hayashi, Koichi Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of universal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e.\ the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15838">A novel approach to the relationships between data features -- based on comprehensive examination of mathematical, technological, and causal methodology</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> JaeHong Kim (Legal Research Institute of Korea University, Seoul, Korea)</p>
<p>Abstract: The expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns about transparency, accountability, and interpretability, with counterfactual reasoning emerging as a key approach to addressing these issues. However, current mathematical, technological, and causal methodologies rely on externalization techniques that normalize feature relationships within a single coordinate space, often distorting intrinsic interactions. This study proposes the Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory, a framework integrating mathematical, technological, and causal perspectives to provide a more precise and comprehensive analysis of feature relationships. CFP theory introduces Hilbert space and backward causation to reinterpret the feature relationships as emergent structures, offering a potential solution to the common cause problem -- a fundamental challenge in causal modeling. From a mathematical -- technical perspective, it utilizes a Riemannian manifold-based framework, thereby improving the structural representation of high- and low-dimensional data interactions. From a causal inference perspective, CFP theory adopts abduction as a methodological foundation, employing Hilbert space for a dynamic causal reasoning approach, where causal relationships are inferred abductively, and feature relationships evolve as emergent properties. Ultimately, CFP theory introduces a novel AI modeling methodology that integrates Hilbert space, backward causation, and Riemannian geometry, strengthening AI governance and transparency in counterfactual reasoning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15840">Vending-Bench: A Benchmark for Long-Term Coherence of Autonomous Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Axel Backlund, Lukas Petersson</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit impressive proficiency in isolated, short-term tasks, they often fail to maintain coherent performance over longer time horizons. In this paper, we present Vending-Bench, a simulated environment designed to specifically test an LLM-based agent's ability to manage a straightforward, long-running business scenario: operating a vending machine. Agents must balance inventories, place orders, set prices, and handle daily fees - tasks that are each simple but collectively, over long horizons (>20M tokens per run) stress an LLM's capacity for sustained, coherent decision-making. Our experiments reveal high variance in performance across multiple LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini manage the machine well in most runs and turn a profit, but all models have runs that derail, either through misinterpreting delivery schedules, forgetting orders, or descending into tangential "meltdown" loops from which they rarely recover. We find no clear correlation between failures and the point at which the model's context window becomes full, suggesting that these breakdowns do not stem from memory limits. Apart from highlighting the high variance in performance over long time horizons, Vending-Bench also tests models' ability to acquire capital, a necessity in many hypothetical dangerous AI scenarios. We hope the benchmark can help in preparing for the advent of stronger AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yara Kyrychenko, Ke Zhou, Edyta Bogucka, Daniele Quercia</p>
<p>Abstract: Constitutional AI (CAI) guides LLM behavior using constitutions, but identifying which principles are most effective for model alignment remains an open challenge. We introduce the C3AI framework (\textit{Crafting Constitutions for CAI models}), which serves two key functions: (1) selecting and structuring principles to form effective constitutions before fine-tuning; and (2) evaluating whether fine-tuned CAI models follow these principles in practice. By analyzing principles from AI and psychology, we found that positively framed, behavior-based principles align more closely with human preferences than negatively framed or trait-based principles. In a safety alignment use case, we applied a graph-based principle selection method to refine an existing CAI constitution, improving safety measures while maintaining strong general reasoning capabilities. Interestingly, fine-tuned CAI models performed well on negatively framed principles but struggled with positively framed ones, in contrast to our human alignment results. This highlights a potential gap between principle design and model adherence. Overall, C3AI provides a structured and scalable approach to both crafting and evaluating CAI constitutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Policymakers are increasingly using development cost and compute as proxies for AI model capabilities and risks. Recent laws have introduced regulatory requirements that are contingent on specific thresholds. However, technical ambiguities in how to perform this accounting could create loopholes that undermine regulatory effectiveness. This paper proposes seven principles for designing practical AI cost and compute accounting standards that (1) reduce opportunities for strategic gaming, (2) avoid disincentivizing responsible risk mitigation, and (3) enable consistent implementation across companies and jurisdictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abbas Sharifi, Hajar Kazemi Naeini, Mohsen Ahmadi, Saeed Asadi, Abbas Varmaghani</p>
<p>Abstract: Land degradation and air pollution are primarily caused by the salinization of soil and desertification that occurs from the drying of salinity lakes and the release of dust into the atmosphere because of their dried bottom. The complete drying up of a lake has caused a community environmental catastrophe. In this study, we presented an optimization problem to determine the total surface runoff to maintain the level of salinity lake (Urmia Lake). The proposed process has two key stages: identifying the influential factors in determining the lake water level using sensitivity analysis approaches based upon historical data and optimizing the effective variable to stabilize the lake water level under changing design variables. Based upon the Sobol'-Jansen and Morris techniques, the groundwater level and total surface runoff flow are highly effective with nonlinear and interacting impacts of the lake water level. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, we found that it may be possible to effectively manage lake levels by adjusting total surface runoff. We used genetic algorithms, non-linear optimization, and pattern search techniques to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the lake level constraint is established based on a pattern as a constant number every month. In order to maintain a consistent pattern of lake levels, it is necessary to increase surface runoff by approximately 8.7 times during filling season. It is necessary to increase this quantity by 33.5 times during the draining season. In the future, the results may serve as a guide for the rehabilitation of the lake.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Jiang, Xinyuan Zhao, Yihang Wu, Ahmad Chaddad</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the medical field, the need for its explainability has grown. In medical image analysis, a high degree of transparency and model interpretability can help clinicians better understand and trust the decision-making process of AI models. In this study, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based approach that aims to enhance the transparency of the AI model in medical image analysis. The initial step is to use traditional CNN to obtain a teacher model and then use KD to simplify the CNN architecture, retain most of the features of the data set, and reduce the number of network layers. It also uses the feature map of the student model to perform hierarchical analysis to identify key features and decision-making processes. This leads to intuitive visual explanations. We selected three public medical data sets (brain tumor, eye disease, and Alzheimer's disease) to test our method. It shows that even when the number of layers is reduced, our model provides a remarkable result in the test set and reduces the time required for the interpretability analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushal Raj Bhandari, Pin-Yu Chen, Jianxi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: As the open-weight AI landscape continues to proliferate-with model development, significant investment, and user interest-it becomes increasingly important to predict which models will ultimately drive innovation and shape AI ecosystems. Building on parallels with citation dynamics in scientific literature, we propose a framework to quantify how an open-weight model's influence evolves. Specifically, we adapt the model introduced by Wang et al. for scientific citations, using three key parameters-immediacy, longevity, and relative fitness-to track the cumulative number of fine-tuned models of an open-weight model. Our findings reveal that this citation-style approach can effectively capture the diverse trajectories of open-weight model adoption, with most models fitting well and outliers indicating unique patterns or abrupt jumps in usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqi Yan, Yue Fan, Hongquan Li, Shan Jiang, Yang Zhao, Xinze Guan, Ching-Chen Kuo, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting inconsistencies confined to a single modality, particularly in text, but struggle with cross-modal conflicts and complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific experimentation, a cornerstone of human progress, demands rigor in reliability, methodical control, and interpretability to yield meaningful results. Despite the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in automating different aspects of the scientific process, automating rigorous experimentation remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose Curie, an AI agent framework designed to embed rigor into the experimentation process through three key components: an intra-agent rigor module to enhance reliability, an inter-agent rigor module to maintain methodical control, and an experiment knowledge module to enhance interpretability. To evaluate Curie, we design a novel experimental benchmark composed of 46 questions across four computer science domains, derived from influential research papers, and widely adopted open-source projects. Compared to the strongest baseline tested, we achieve a 3.4$\times$ improvement in correctly answering experimental questions.Curie is open-sourced at https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101">Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Linda Zeng, Rithwik Gupta, Divij Motwani, Diji Yang, Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent agent frameworks and inference-time algorithms often struggle with complex planning problems due to limitations in verifying generated plans or reasoning and varying complexity of instances within a single task. Many existing methods for these tasks either perform task-level verification without considering constraints or apply inference-time algorithms without adapting to instance-level complexity. To address these limitations, we propose PlanGEN, a model-agnostic and easily scalable agent framework with three key components: constraint, verification, and selection agents. Specifically, our approach proposes constraint-guided iterative verification to enhance performance of inference-time algorithms--Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE. In PlanGEN framework, the selection agent optimizes algorithm choice based on instance complexity, ensuring better adaptability to complex planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the strongest baseline across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on NATURAL PLAN ($\sim$8%$\uparrow$), OlympiadBench ($\sim$4%$\uparrow$), DocFinQA ($\sim$7%$\uparrow$), and GPQA ($\sim$1%$\uparrow$). Our key finding highlights that constraint-guided iterative verification improves inference-time algorithms, and adaptive selection further boosts performance on complex planning and reasoning problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyang Li, Weiqi Wang, Tianshi Zheng, Yangqiu Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition, enables generalization from limited data but hasn't yet been fully achieved by large language models (LLMs). While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henrik Nolte, Miriam Rateike, Mich\`ele Finck</p>
<p>Abstract: The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) establishes different legal principles for different types of AI systems. While prior work has sought to clarify some of these principles, little attention has been paid to robustness and cybersecurity. This paper aims to fill this gap. We identify legal challenges and shortcomings in provisions related to robustness and cybersecurity for high-risk AI systems (Art. 15 AIA) and general-purpose AI models (Art. 55 AIA). We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions. Furthermore, we assess potential challenges in implementing these provisions in light of recent advancements in the machine learning (ML) literature. Our analysis informs efforts to develop harmonized standards, guidelines by the European Commission, as well as benchmarks and measurement methodologies under Art. 15(2) AIA. With this, we seek to bridge the gap between legal terminology and ML research, fostering a better alignment between research and implementation efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindita Chattopadhyay, Vijay Kumar Sutrakar</p>
<p>Abstract: A critical stage in the evolving landscape of VLSI design is the design phase that is transformed into register-transfer level (RTL), which specifies system functionality through hardware description languages like Verilog. Generally, evaluating the quality of an RTL design demands full synthesis via electronic design automation (EDA) tool is time-consuming process that is not well-suited to rapid design iteration and optimization. Although recent breakthroughs in machine Learning (ML) have brought early prediction models, these methods usually do not provide robust and generalizable solutions with respect to a wide range of RTL designs. This paper proposes a pre-synthesis framework that makes early estimation of power, performance and area (PPA) metrics directly from the hardware description language (HDL) code making direct use of library files instead of toggle files. The proposed framework introduces a bit-level representation referred to as the simple operator graph (SOG), which uses single-bit operators to generate a generalized and flexible structure that closely mirrors the characteristics of post synthesis design. The proposed model bridges the RTL and post-synthesis design, which will help in precisely predicting key metrics. The proposed tree-based ML framework shows superior predictive performance PPA estimation. Validation is carried out on 147 distinct RTL designs. The proposed model with 147 different designs shows accuracy of 98%, 98%, and 90% for WNS, TNS and power, respectively, indicates significant accuracy improvements relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Ding, Wentao Jiang, Shunyu Liu, Yongcheng Jing, Jinyang Guo, Yingjie Wang, Jing Zhang, Zengmao Wang, Ziwei Liu, Bo Du, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose L. Garcia, Karolina Hajkova, Maria Marchenko, Carlos Miguel Pati\~no</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study and extension of "Cooperation, Competition, and Maliciousness: LLM-Stakeholders Interactive Negotiation." We validate the original findings using a range of open-weight models (1.5B-70B parameters) and GPT-4o Mini while introducing several novel contributions. We analyze the Pareto front of the games, propose a communication-free baseline to test whether successful negotiations are possible without agent interaction, evaluate recent small language models' performance, analyze structural information leakage in model responses, and implement an inequality metric to assess negotiation fairness. Our results demonstrate that smaller models (<10B parameters) struggle with format adherence and coherent responses, but larger open-weight models can approach proprietary model performance. Additionally, in many scenarios, single-agent approaches can achieve comparable results to multi-agent negotiations, challenging assumptions about the necessity of agent communication to perform well on the benchmark. This work also provides insights into the accessibility, fairness, environmental impact, and privacy considerations of LLM-based negotiation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Shirali, Arash Nasr-Esfahany, Abdullah Alomar, Parsa Mirtaheri, Rediet Abebe, Ariel Procaccia</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment with human preferences is commonly framed using a universal reward function, even though human preferences are inherently heterogeneous. We formalize this heterogeneity by introducing user types and examine the limits of the homogeneity assumption. We show that aligning to heterogeneous preferences with a single policy is best achieved using the average reward across user types. However, this requires additional information about annotators. We examine improvements under different information settings, focusing on direct alignment methods. We find that minimal information can yield first-order improvements, while full feedback from each user type leads to consistent learning of the optimal policy. Surprisingly, however, no sample-efficient consistent direct loss exists in this latter setting. These results reveal a fundamental tension between consistency and sample efficiency in direct policy alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explainable AI is increasingly employing argumentation methods to facilitate interactive explanations between AI agents and human users. While existing approaches typically rely on predetermined human user models, there remains a critical gap in dynamically learning and updating these models during interactions. In this paper, we present a framework that enables AI agents to adapt their understanding of human users through argumentation-based dialogues. Our approach, called Persona, draws on prospect theory and integrates a probability weighting function with a Bayesian belief update mechanism that refines a probability distribution over possible human models based on exchanged arguments. Through empirical evaluations with human users in an applied argumentation setting, we demonstrate that Persona effectively captures evolving human beliefs, facilitates personalized interactions, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Ma, Xiu-min Wang, Chen Chen, Xiao-bin Xu, Xin-ping Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing navigation decision support systems often perform poorly when handling non-predefined navigation scenarios. Leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language model (LLM) in handling unknown scenarios, this research proposes a dual-core framework for LLM applications to address this issue. Firstly, through ReAct-based prompt engineering, a larger LLM core decomposes intricate navigation tasks into manageable sub-tasks, which autonomously invoke corresponding external tools to gather relevant information, using this feedback to mitigate the risk of LLM hallucinations. Subsequently, a fine-tuned and compact LLM core, acting like a first-mate is designed to process such information and unstructured external data, then to generates context-aware recommendations, ultimately delivering lookout insights and navigation hints that adhere to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and other rules. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed framework not only excels in traditional ship collision avoidance tasks but also adapts effectively to unstructured, non-predefined, and unpredictable scenarios. A comparative analysis with DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o and other SOTA models highlights the efficacy and rationality of the proposed framework. This research bridges the gap between conventional navigation systems and LLMs, offering a framework to enhance safety and operational efficiency across diverse navigation applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency Response Time (ERT) is crucial for urban safety, measuring cities' ability to handle medical, fire, and crime emergencies. In NYC, medical ERT increased 72% from 7.89 minutes in 2014 to 14.27 minutes in 2024, with half of delays due to Emergency Vehicle (EMV) travel times. Each minute's delay in stroke response costs 2 million brain cells, while cardiac arrest survival drops 7-10% per minute.
  This dissertation advances EMV facilitation through three contributions. First, EMVLight, a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, integrates EMV routing with traffic signal pre-emption. It achieved 42.6% faster EMV travel times and 23.5% improvement for other vehicles.
  Second, the Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane system uses Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for coordinated lane-clearing in mixed autonomous and human-driven traffic, reducing EMV travel times by 40%.
  Third, an equity study of NYC Emergency Medical Services revealed disparities across boroughs: Staten Island faces delays due to sparse signalized intersections, while Manhattan struggles with congestion. Solutions include optimized EMS stations and improved intersection designs.
  These contributions enhance EMV mobility and emergency service equity, offering insights for policymakers and urban planners to develop safer, more efficient transportation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pankaj Yadav, Gulshan Sihag, Vivek Vijay</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are used in diverse domains, many of which face significant challenges due to data imbalance. Studies have explored various approaches to address the issue, like data preprocessing, cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble methods. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) showed immense potential as a data preprocessing technique that generates good quality synthetic data. This study employs a systematic mapping methodology to analyze 3041 papers on GAN-based sampling techniques for imbalanced data sourced from four digital libraries. A filtering process identified 100 key studies spanning domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, this research introduces three categorization mappings as application domains, GAN techniques, and GAN variants used to handle the imbalanced nature of the data. GAN-based over-sampling emerges as an effective preprocessing method. Advanced architectures and tailored frameworks helped GANs to improve further in the case of data imbalance. GAN variants like vanilla GAN, CTGAN, and CGAN show great adaptability in structured imbalanced data cases. Interest in GANs for imbalanced data has grown tremendously, touching a peak in recent years, with journals and conferences playing crucial roles in transmitting foundational theories and practical applications. While with these advances, none of the reviewed studies explicitly explore hybridized GAN frameworks with diffusion models or reinforcement learning techniques. This gap leads to a future research idea develop innovative approaches for effectively handling data imbalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xing, Boyang Sun, Kun Zhang, Timothy Baldwin, Jey Han Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Rumours in online social media pose significant risks to modern society, motivating the need for better understanding of how they develop. We focus specifically on the interface between emotion and rumours in threaded discourses, building on the surprisingly sparse literature on the topic which has largely focused on emotions within the original rumour posts themselves, and largely overlooked the comparative differences between rumours and non-rumours. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytical emotion framework, contrasting rumour and non-rumour cases using existing NLP datasets to further understand the emotion dynamics within rumours. Our framework reveals several findings: rumours exhibit more negative sentiment and emotions, including anger, fear and pessimism, while non-rumours evoke more positive emotions; emotions are contagious in online interactions, with rumours facilitate negative emotions and non-rumours foster positive emotions; and based on causal analysis, surprise acts as a bridge between rumours and other emotions, pessimism is driven by sadness and fear, optimism by joy and love.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dnyanesh Panchal, Aaryan Gole, Vaibhav Narute, Raunak Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to legal knowledge in India is often hindered by a lack of awareness, misinformation and limited accessibility to judicial resources. Many individuals struggle to navigate complex legal frameworks, leading to the frequent misuse of laws and inadequate legal protection. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based legal chatbot powered by vectorstore oriented FAISS for efficient and accurate legal information retrieval. Unlike traditional chatbots, our model is trained using an extensive dataset comprising legal books, official documentation and the Indian Constitution, ensuring accurate responses to even the most complex or misleading legal queries. The chatbot leverages FAISS for rapid vector-based search, significantly improving retrieval speed and accuracy. It is also prompt-engineered to handle twisted or ambiguous legal questions, reducing the chances of incorrect interpretations. Apart from its core functionality of answering legal queries, the platform includes additional features such as real-time legal news updates, legal blogs, and access to law-related books, making it a comprehensive resource for users. By integrating advanced AI techniques with an optimized retrieval system, our chatbot aims to democratize legal knowledge, enhance legal literacy, and prevent the spread of misinformation. The study demonstrates that our approach effectively improves legal accessibility while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency, thereby contributing to a more informed and empowered society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Wang, Jianting Tang, Chaohu Liu, Linli Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable image understanding and dialogue capabilities, allowing them to handle a variety of visual question answering tasks. However, their widespread availability raises concerns about unauthorized usage and copyright infringement, where users or individuals can develop their own LVLMs by fine-tuning published models. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Parameter Learning Attack (PLA) for tracking the copyright of LVLMs without modifying the original model. Specifically, we construct adversarial images through targeted attacks against the original model, enabling it to generate specific outputs. To ensure these attacks remain effective on potential fine-tuned models to trigger copyright tracking, we allow the original model to learn the trigger images by updating parameters in the opposite direction during the adversarial attack process. Notably, the proposed method can be applied after the release of the original model, thus not affecting the model's performance and behavior. To simulate real-world applications, we fine-tune the original model using various strategies across diverse datasets, creating a range of models for copyright verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can more effectively identify the original copyright of fine-tuned models compared to baseline methods. Therefore, this work provides a powerful tool for tracking copyrights and detecting unlicensed usage of LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Magnus F. Gjerde, Vanessa Cheung, David Lagnado</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly important to understand their abilities and limitations. In two experiments, we investigate the causal and compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs and humans in the domain of object affordances, an area traditionally linked to embodied cognition. The tasks, designed from scratch to avoid data contamination, require decision-makers to select unconventional objects to replace a typical tool for a particular purpose, such as using a table tennis racket to dig a hole. In Experiment 1, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, finding that GPT-4o, when given chain-of-thought prompting, performed on par with human participants, while GPT-3.5 lagged significantly. In Experiment 2, we introduced two new conditions, Distractor (more object choices, increasing difficulty) and Image (object options presented visually), and evaluated Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in addition to the GPT models. The Distractor condition significantly impaired performance across humans and models, although GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 still performed well above chance. Surprisingly, the Image condition had little impact on humans or GPT-4o, but significantly lowered Claude 3.5's accuracy. Qualitative analysis showed that GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 have a stronger ability than their predecessors to identify and flexibly apply causally relevant object properties. The improvement from GPT-3.5 and Claude 3 to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 suggests that models are increasingly capable of causal and compositional reasoning in some domains, although further mechanistic research is necessary to understand how LLMs reason.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuli Zhang, Shangbo Wang, Dongyao Jia, Pengfei Fan, Ruiyuan Jiang, Hankang Gu, Andy H. F. Chow</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, with deep neural networks substantially augmenting its learning capabilities. However, centralized RL becomes impractical for ATSC involving multiple agents due to the exceedingly high dimensionality of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) mitigates this scalability issue by decentralizing control to local RL agents. Nevertheless, this decentralized method introduces new challenges: the environment becomes partially observable from the perspective of each local agent due to constrained inter-agent communication. Both centralized RL and MARL exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses, particularly under heavy intersectional traffic conditions. In this paper, we justify that MARL can achieve the optimal global Q-value by separating into multiple IRL (Independent Reinforcement Learning) processes when no spill-back congestion occurs (no agent dependency) among agents (intersections). In the presence of spill-back congestion (with agent dependency), the maximum global Q-value can be achieved by using centralized RL. Building upon the conclusions, we propose a novel Dynamic Parameter Update Strategy for Deep Q-Network (DQN-DPUS), which updates the weights and bias based on the dependency dynamics among agents, i.e. updating only the diagonal sub-matrices for the scenario without spill-back congestion. We validate the DQN-DPUS in a simple network with two intersections under varying traffic, and show that the proposed strategy can speed up the convergence rate without sacrificing optimal exploration. The results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the efficacy of DQN-DPUS in optimizing traffic signal control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Planning with options -- a sequence of primitive actions -- has been shown effective in reinforcement learning within complex environments. Previous studies have focused on planning with predefined options or learned options through expert demonstration data. Inspired by MuZero, which learns superhuman heuristics without any human knowledge, we propose a novel approach, named OptionZero. OptionZero incorporates an option network into MuZero, providing autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Furthermore, we modify the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options, allowing searching deeper under the same simulation constraints. Empirical experiments conducted in 26 Atari games demonstrate that OptionZero outperforms MuZero, achieving a 131.58% improvement in mean human-normalized score. Our behavior analysis shows that OptionZero not only learns options but also acquires strategic skills tailored to different game characteristics. Our findings show promising directions for discovering and using options in planning. Our code is available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/optionzero.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Step-by-Step Coding (SBSC): a multi-turn math reasoning framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate sequence of programs for solving Olympiad level math problems. At each step/turn, by leveraging the code execution outputs and programs of previous steps, the model generates the next sub-task and the corresponding program to solve it. This way, SBSC, sequentially navigates to reach the final answer. SBSC allows more granular, flexible and precise approach to problem-solving compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of SBSC in tackling competition and Olympiad-level math problems. For Claude-3.5-Sonnet, we observe SBSC (greedy decoding) surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) program generation based reasoning strategies by absolute 10.7% on AMC12, 8% on AIME and 12.6% on MathOdyssey. Given SBSC is multi-turn in nature, we also benchmark SBSC's greedy decoding against self-consistency decoding results of existing SOTA math reasoning strategies and observe performance gain by absolute 6.2% on AMC, 6.7% on AIME and 7.4% on MathOdyssey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Martorell</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent and reason about spatial information is crucial for building robust agentic systems that can navigate real and simulated environments. In this work, we investigate the influence of different text-based spatial representations on LLM performance and internal activations in a grid-world navigation task. By evaluating models of various sizes on a task that requires navigating toward a goal, we examine how the format used to encode spatial information impacts decision-making. Our experiments reveal that cartesian representations of space consistently yield higher success rates and path efficiency, with performance scaling markedly with model size. Moreover, probing LLaMA-3.1-8B revealed subsets of internal units, primarily located in intermediate layers, that robustly correlate with spatial features, such as the position of the agent in the grid or action correctness, regardless of how that information is represented, and are also activated by unrelated spatial reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jibang Wu, Chenghao Yang, Simon Mahns, Chaoqi Wang, Hao Zhu, Fei Fang, Haifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin. Our findings suggest a promising LLM-based agentic framework to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring responsible generation using only facts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyu Tao, Guangyuan Ma, Huixiong Yang, Minyan Lu, Guodan Wei, Guangmin Zhou, Xuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As electric vehicles (EVs) approach the end of their operational life, their batteries retain significant economic value and present promising opportunities for second-life use and material recycling. This is particularly compelling for Global South and other underdeveloped regions, where reliable energy storage is vital to addressing critical challenges posed by weak and even nonexistent power grid and energy infrastructures. However, despite this potential, widespread adoption has been hindered by critical uncertainties surrounding the technical performance, safety, and recertification of second-life batteries. In cases where they have been redeployed, mismatches between estimated and actual performance often render batteries technically unsuitable or hazardous, turning them into liabilities for communities they were intended to benefit. This considerable misalignment exacerbates energy access disparities and undermines the broader vision of energy justice, highlighting an urgent need for robust and scalable solutions to unlock the potential. In the PulseBat Dataset, the authors tested 464 retired lithium-ion batteries, covering 3 cathode material types, 6 historical usages, 3 physical formats, and 6 capacity designs. The pulse test experiments were performed repeatedly for each second-life battery with 10 pulse width, 10 pulse magnitude, multiple state-of-charge, and state-of-health conditions, e.g., from 0.37 to 1.03. The PulseBat Dataset recorded these test conditions and the voltage response as well as the temperature signals that were subject to the injected pulse current, which could be used as a valuable data resource for critical diagnostics tasks such as state-of-charge estimation, state-of-health estimation, cathode material type identification, open-circuit voltage reconstruction, thermal management, and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhi Hao (Department of Economics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), Danyang Xie (Thrust of Innovation, Policy, and Entrepreneurship, the Society Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper pioneers a novel approach to economic and public policy analysis by leveraging multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) as heterogeneous artificial economic agents. We first evaluate five LLMs' economic decision-making capabilities in solving two-period consumption allocation problems under two distinct scenarios: with explicit utility functions and based on intuitive reasoning. While previous research has often simulated heterogeneity by solely varying prompts, our approach harnesses the inherent variations in analytical capabilities across different LLMs to model agents with diverse cognitive traits. Building on these findings, we construct a Multi-LLM-Agent-Based (MLAB) framework by mapping these LLMs to specific educational groups and corresponding income brackets. Using interest-income taxation as a case study, we demonstrate how the MLAB framework can simulate policy impacts across heterogeneous agents, offering a promising new direction for economic and public policy analysis by leveraging LLMs' human-like reasoning capabilities and computational power.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Stephen White, Saad Hassan, Philip A Kalra, James Ritchie, Carl Diver, Jennie Shorley</p>
<p>Abstract: Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI), remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional cardiovascular risk scores rely primarily on clinical data, often overlooking environmental influences like air pollution that significantly impact heart health. Moreover, integrating complex time-series environmental data with clinical records is challenging.
  We introduce TabulaTime, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances ACS risk prediction by combining clinical risk factors with air pollution data. TabulaTime features three key innovations: First, it integrates time-series air pollution data with clinical tabular data to improve prediction accuracy. Second, its PatchRWKV module automatically extracts complex temporal patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional feature engineering while maintaining linear computational complexity. Third, attention mechanisms enhance interpretability by revealing interactions between clinical and environmental factors.
  Experimental results show that TabulaTime improves prediction accuracy by over 20% compared to conventional models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with air pollution data alone contributing over a 10% improvement. Feature importance analysis identifies critical predictors including previous angina, systolic blood pressure, PM10, and NO2. Overall, TabulaTime bridges clinical and environmental insights, supporting personalized prevention strategies and informing public health policies to mitigate ACS risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Jung Chen, Chung-Chin Shih, Ti-Rong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Strength estimation and adjustment are crucial in designing human-AI interactions, particularly in games where AI surpasses human players. This paper introduces a novel strength system, including a strength estimator (SE) and an SE-based Monte Carlo tree search, denoted as SE-MCTS, which predicts strengths from games and offers different playing strengths with human styles. The strength estimator calculates strength scores and predicts ranks from games without direct human interaction. SE-MCTS utilizes the strength scores in a Monte Carlo tree search to adjust playing strength and style. We first conduct experiments in Go, a challenging board game with a wide range of ranks. Our strength estimator significantly achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting ranks by observing 15 games only, whereas the previous method reached 49% accuracy for 100 games. For strength adjustment, SE-MCTS successfully adjusts to designated ranks while achieving a 51.33% accuracy in aligning to human actions, outperforming a previous state-of-the-art, with only 42.56% accuracy. To demonstrate the generality of our strength system, we further apply SE and SE-MCTS to chess and obtain consistent results. These results show a promising approach to strength estimation and adjustment, enhancing human-AI interactions in games.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lionel Richy Panlap Houamegni, Fatih Gedikli</p>
<p>Abstract: The automation of news analysis and summarization presents a promising solution to the challenge of processing and analyzing vast amounts of information prevalent in today's information society. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to transform vast amounts of textual data into concise and easily comprehensible summaries, offering an effective solution to the problem of information overload and providing users with a quick overview of relevant information. A particularly significant application of this technology lies in supply chain risk analysis. Companies must monitor the news about their suppliers and respond to incidents for several critical reasons, including compliance with laws and regulations, risk management, and maintaining supply chain resilience. This paper develops an automated news summarization system for supply chain risk analysis using LLMs. The proposed solution aggregates news from various sources, summarizes them using LLMs, and presents the condensed information to users in a clear and concise format. This approach enables companies to optimize their information processing and make informed decisions. Our study addresses two main research questions: (1) Are LLMs effective in automating news summarization, particularly in the context of supply chain risk analysis? (2) How effective are various LLMs in terms of readability, duplicate detection, and risk identification in their summarization quality? In this paper, we conducted an offline study using a range of publicly available LLMs at the time and complemented it with a user study focused on the top performing systems of the offline experiments to evaluate their effectiveness further. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Few-Shot GPT-4o mini, offer significant improvements in summary quality and risk identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianhui Zhao, Li Zhang, Fang Liu, Xiaoli Lian, Qiaoyuanhe Meng, Ziqian Jiao, Zetong Zhou, Borui Zhang, Runlin Guo, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but the autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to poor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly focus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they treat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and semantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in code generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world programming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17216">Making LLMs Reason? The Intermediate Language Problem in Neurosymbolic Approaches</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Beiser, David Penz</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning tasks manifest themselves as a challenge to Large Language Models (LLMs). Neurosymbolic approaches use LLMs to translate logical reasoning problems formulated in natural language into a formal intermediate language. Subsequently, the usage of symbolic reasoners yields reliable solving thereof. However, LLMs often fail in translation due to poorly chosen intermediate languages.
  We introduce the intermediate language problem, which is the problem of choosing a suitable formal language representation for neurosymbolic approaches. Theoretically, we argue that its origins lie in the inability of LLMs to distinguish syntax from semantics and the relative independence of the problem from its representation. We showcase its existence experimentally by contrasting two intermediate languages, Answer Set Programming and the Python Knowledge Engine. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of varying degrees of supplementary context information. Our results show a maximum difference in overall-accuracy of 53.20% and 49.26% in execution-accuracy. When using the GPT4o-mini LLM we beat the state-of-the-art in overall-accuracy on the ProntoQA dataset by 21.20% and by 50.50% on the ProofWriter dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumen Sinha, Tanisha Rana, Rahul Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (M^2RAG), a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in leveraging knowledge from multi-modal retrieval documents. The benchmark comprises four tasks: image captioning, multi-modal question answering, multi-modal fact verification, and image reranking. All tasks are set in an open-domain setting, requiring RAG models to retrieve query-relevant information from a multi-modal document collection and use it as input context for RAG modeling. To enhance the context utilization capabilities of MLLMs, we also introduce Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning (MM-RAIT), an instruction tuning method that optimizes MLLMs within multi-modal contexts. Our experiments show that MM-RAIT improves the performance of RAG systems by enabling them to effectively learn from multi-modal contexts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangshijie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in the field of natural language processing (NLP), leading to widely recognized applications such as ChatGPT. However, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. Unlike continuous domains like images, text exists in a discrete space, making even minor alterations at the sentence, word, or character level easily perceptible to humans. This inherent discreteness also complicates the use of conventional optimization techniques, as text is non-differentiable. Previous research on adversarial attacks in text has focused on character-level, word-level, sentence-level, and multi-level approaches, all of which suffer from inefficiency or perceptibility issues due to the need for multiple queries or significant semantic shifts.
  In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial attack method, Emoji-Attack, which leverages the manipulation of emojis to create subtle, yet effective, perturbations. Unlike character- and word-level strategies, Emoji-Attack targets emojis as a distinct layer of attack, resulting in less noticeable changes with minimal disruption to the text. This approach has been largely unexplored in previous research, which typically focuses on emoji insertion as an extension of character-level attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that Emoji-Attack achieves strong attack performance on both large and small models, making it a promising technique for enhancing adversarial robustness in NLP systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinzheng Li, Jingshu Zhang, Hongguang Li, Yiqing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial decision-making requires processing vast amounts of real-time information while understanding their complex temporal relationships. While traditional search engines excel at providing real-time information access, they often struggle to comprehend sophisticated user intentions and contextual nuances. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate reasoning and interaction capabilities but may generate unreliable outputs without access to current data. While recent attempts have been made to combine LLMs with search capabilities, they suffer from (1) restricted access to specialized financial data, (2) static query structures that cannot adapt to dynamic market conditions, and (3) insufficient temporal awareness in result generation. To address these challenges, we present FinSearch, a novel agent-based search framework specifically designed for financial applications that interface with diverse financial data sources including market, stock, and news data. Innovatively, FinSearch comprises four components: (1) an LLM-based multi-step search pre-planner that decomposes user queries into structured sub-queries mapped to specific data sources through a graph representation; (2) a search executor with an LLM-based adaptive query rewriter that executes the searching of each sub-query while dynamically refining the sub-queries in its subsequent node based on intermediate search results; (3) a temporal weighting mechanism that prioritizes information relevance based on the deduced time context from the user's query; (4) an LLM-based response generator that synthesizes results into coherent, contextually appropriate outputs. To evaluate FinSearch, we construct FinSearchBench-24, a benchmark of 1,500 four-choice questions across the stock market, rate changes, monetary policy, and industry developments spanning from June to October 2024.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), adopted to understand human language, drive the development of artificial intelligence (AI) web search agents. Compared to traditional search engines, LLM-powered AI search agents are capable of understanding and responding to complex queries with greater depth, enabling more accurate operations and better context recognition. However, little attention and effort has been paid to the Chinese web search, which results in that the capabilities of open-source models have not been uniformly and fairly evaluated. The difficulty lies in lacking three aspects: an unified agent framework, an accurately labeled dataset, and a suitable evaluation metric. To address these issues, we propose a general-purpose and training-free web search agent by level-aware navigation, Level-Navi Agent, accompanied by a well-annotated dataset (Web24) and a suitable evaluation metric. Level-Navi Agent can think through complex user questions and conduct searches across various levels on the internet to gather information for questions. Meanwhile, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs under fair settings. To further facilitate future research, source code is available at Github.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web crawling is a critical technique for extracting online data, yet it poses challenges due to webpage diversity and anti-scraping mechanisms. This study investigates the integration of generative AI tools Claude AI (Sonnet 3.5) and ChatGPT4.0 with prompt engineering to automate web scraping. Using two prompts, PROMPT I (general inference, tested on Yahoo News) and PROMPT II (element-specific, tested on Coupons.com), we evaluate the code quality and performance of AI-generated scripts. Claude AI consistently outperformed ChatGPT-4.0 in script quality and adaptability, as confirmed by predefined evaluation metrics, including functionality, readability, modularity, and robustness. Performance data were collected through manual testing and structured scoring by three evaluators. Visualizations further illustrate Claude AI's superiority. Anti-scraping solutions, including undetected_chromedriver, Selenium, and fake_useragent, were incorporated to enhance performance. This paper demonstrates how generative AI combined with prompt engineering can simplify and improve web scraping workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Familiarizing oneself with a new scientific field and its existing literature can be daunting due to the large amount of available articles. Curated lists of academic references, or reading lists, compiled by experts, offer a structured way to gain a comprehensive overview of a domain or a specific scientific challenge. In this work, we introduce ACL-rlg, the largest open expert-annotated reading list dataset. We also provide multiple baselines for evaluating reading list generation and formally define it as a retrieval task. Our qualitative study highlights the fact that traditional scholarly search engines and indexing methods perform poorly on this task, and GPT-4o, despite showing better results, exhibits signs of potential data contamination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Yang, Xingrun Li, Heng Chang, Jinze Yang, Xihong Yang, Shengyu Tao, Ningkang Chang, Maiko Shigeno, Junfeng Wang, Dawei Yin, Erxue Min</p>
<p>Abstract: The cold start problem is a challenging problem faced by most modern recommender systems. By leveraging knowledge from other domains, cross-domain recommendation can be an effective method to alleviate the cold start problem. However, the modelling distortion for long-tail data, which is widely present in recommender systems, is often overlooked in cross-domain recommendation. In this research, we propose a hyperbolic manifold based cross-domain collaborative filtering model using BiTGCF as the base model. We introduce the hyperbolic manifold and construct new propagation layer and transfer layer to address these challenges. The significant performance improvements across various datasets compared to the baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Wang, Weisong Wang, Xuanji Xiao, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems have now become an essential part of modern content platforms. Yet, traditional behavior-based recommendation models often struggle with cold users, who have limited interaction data. Despite this, engaging these users is crucial for the ongoing growth of content platforms. To bridge this gap, we propose utilizing the social-relation graph to enrich the interest profiles derived from behavior-based models. While social graphs are ubiquitous on content platforms, extracting value from this data is challenging due to social-relation noise and interest inconsistency. To address the noise propagation issue in graph data and obtain accurate social interest, we employ a dual-view denoising strategy. It first applies low-rank SVD to the user-item matrix to extract denoised user embeddings. These embeddings are then used to generate a reconstructed social graph. Finally, the strategy implements contrastive learning between the original and reconstructed social graphs. Addressing the interest inconsistency between social and behavioral interests, we adopt a mutual distillation technique to isolate the original interests into four sub-interests, namely aligned social/behavior interests and social/behavior specific interests, which maximally fuse the two interests. Experimental results on industry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, particularly for cold users, verifying that effectively fusing social relations and behaviors can be highly beneficial for modern recommendation platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Shi, Shanglin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fashion, deeply rooted in sociocultural dynamics, evolves as individuals emulate styles popularized by influencers and iconic figures. In the quest to replicate such refined tastes using artificial intelligence, traditional fashion ensemble methods have primarily used supervised learning to imitate the decisions of style icons, which falter when faced with distribution shifts, leading to style replication discrepancies triggered by slight variations in input. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have become prominent across various sectors, recognized for their user-friendly interfaces, strong conversational skills, and advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Fashion Large Language Model (FLLM), which employs auto-prompt generation training strategies to enhance its capacity for delivering personalized fashion advice while retaining essential domain knowledge. Additionally, by integrating a retrieval augmentation technique during inference, the model can better adjust to individual preferences. Our results show that this approach surpasses existing models in accuracy, interpretability, and few-shot learning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexu Sun, Qiyu Han, Minqin Zhu, Hao Gong, Dugang Liu, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving user engagement and platform revenue is crucial for online marketing platforms. Uplift modeling is proposed to solve this problem, which applies different treatments (e.g., discounts, bonus) to satisfy corresponding users. Despite progress in this field, limitations persist. Firstly, most of them focus on scenarios where only user features exist. However, in real-world scenarios, there are rich contexts available in the online platform (e.g., short videos, news), and the uplift model needs to infer an incentive for each user on the specific item, which is called real-time marketing. Thus, only considering the user features will lead to biased prediction of the responses, which may cause the cumulative error for uplift prediction. Moreover, due to the large-scale contexts, directly concatenating the context features with the user features will cause a severe distribution shift in the treatment and control groups. Secondly, capturing the interaction relationship between the user features and context features can better predict the user response. To solve the above limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic Robust Uplift Modeling with Large-Scale Contexts (UMLC) framework for Real-time Marketing. Our UMLC includes two customized modules. 1) A response-guided context grouping module for extracting context features information and condensing value space through clusters. 2) A feature interaction module for obtaining better uplift prediction. Specifically, this module contains two parts: a user-context interaction component for better modeling the response; a treatment-feature interaction component for discovering the treatment assignment sensitive feature of each instance to better predict the uplift. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and a real-world product dataset to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our UMLC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Arslan (Le2i, ICB), Saba Munawar (NUCES), Christophe Cruz</p>
<p>Abstract: Businesses heavily rely on data sourced from various channels like news articles, financial reports, and consumer reviews to drive their operations, enabling informed decision-making and identifying opportunities. However, traditional manual methods for data extraction are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the adoption of digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency. Yet, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a sustainable solution for Information Extraction (IE) and processing. The research methodology involves reviewing existing solutions for business decision-making, noting that many systems require training new machine learning models, which are resource-intensive and have significant environmental impacts. Instead, we propose a sustainable business solution using pre-existing LLMs that can work with diverse datasets. We link domain-specific datasets to tailor LLMs to company needs and employ a Multi-Agent architecture to divide tasks such as information retrieval, enrichment, and classification among specialized agents. This approach optimizes the extraction process and improves overall efficiency. Through the utilization of these technologies, businesses can optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making processes, and contribute to sustainable development goals, thereby fostering environmental responsibility within the corporate sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Arslan (Le2i, ICB), Saba Munawar (NUCES), Christophe Cruz (ICB)</p>
<p>Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, media content stands as the foundation for political news analysis, offering invaluable insights sourced from various channels like news articles, social media updates, speeches, and reports. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized Political Information Extraction (IE), automating tasks such as Event Extraction (EE) from these diverse media outlets. While traditional NLP methods often necessitate specialized expertise to build rule-based systems or train machine learning models with domain-specific datasets, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a promising alternative. These models offer accessibility, alleviating challenges associated with model construction from scratch and reducing the dependency on extensive datasets during the training phase, thus facilitating rapid implementation. However, challenges persist in handling domain-specific tasks, leading to the development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating external data retrieval, enriching their contextual understanding, and expanding their knowledge base beyond pre-existing training data. To illustrate RAG's efficacy, we introduce the Political EE system, specifically tailored to extract political event information from news articles. Understanding these political insights is essential for remaining informed about the latest political advancements, whether on a national or global scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Xue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing tasks, with the potential to automate systematic reviews. This study evaluates the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs in conducting systematic review tasks. We assessed GPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral 8x7B across four systematic review tasks: study design formulation, search strategy development, literature screening, and data extraction. Sourced from a previously published systematic review, we provided reference standard including standard PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) design, standard eligibility criteria, and data from 20 reference literature. Three investigators evaluated the quality of study design and eligibility criteria using 5-point Liker Scale in terms of accuracy, integrity, relevance, consistency and overall performance. For other tasks, the output is defined as accurate if it is the same as the reference standard. Search strategy performance was evaluated through accuracy and retrieval efficacy. Screening accuracy was assessed for both abstracts screening and full texts screening. Data extraction accuracy was evaluated across 1,120 data points comprising 3,360 individual fields. Claude-3 demonstrated superior overall performance in PICO design. In search strategy formulation, GPT-4 and Claude-3 achieved comparable accuracy, outperforming Mistral. For abstract screening, GPT-4 achieved the highest accuracy, followed by Mistral and Claude-3. In data extraction, GPT-4 significantly outperformed other models. LLMs demonstrate potential for automating systematic review tasks, with GPT-4 showing superior performance in search strategy formulation, literature screening and data extraction. These capabilities make them promising assistive tools for researchers and warrant further development and validation in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of AI in education offers significant potential to enhance learning efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, allow students to query a wide range of topics, providing unprecedented flexibility. However, LLMs face challenges, such as handling varying content relevance and lack of personalization. To address these challenges, we propose TutorLLM, a personalized learning recommender LLM system based on Knowledge Tracing (KT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The novelty of TutorLLM lies in its unique combination of KT and RAG techniques with LLMs, which enables dynamic retrieval of context-specific knowledge and provides personalized learning recommendations based on the student's personal learning state. Specifically, this integration allows TutorLLM to tailor responses based on individual learning states predicted by the Multi-Features with Latent Relations BERT-based KT (MLFBK) model and to enhance response accuracy with a Scraper model. The evaluation includes user assessment questionnaires and performance metrics, demonstrating a 10\% improvement in user satisfaction and a 5\% increase in quiz scores compared to using general LLMs alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing prominence of AI necessitates the deployment of inference platforms for efficient and effective management of AI pipelines and compute resources. As these pipelines grow in complexity, the demand for distributed serving rises and introduces much-dreaded network delays. In this paper, we investigate how the network can instead be a boon to the excessively high resource overheads of AI pipelines. To alleviate these overheads, we discuss how resource-intensive data processing tasks -- a key facet of growing AI pipeline complexity -- are well-matched for the computational characteristics of packet processing pipelines and how they can be offloaded onto SmartNICs. We explore the challenges and opportunities of offloading, and propose a research agenda for integrating network hardware into AI pipelines, unlocking new opportunities for optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Alagha, Maha Kadadha, Rabeb Mizouni, Shakti Singh, Jamal Bentahar, Hadi Otrok</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of selecting relay nodes and coordinating among them in UAV-assisted Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV). The selection of UAV relay nodes in IoV employs mechanisms executed either at centralized servers or decentralized nodes, which have two main limitations: 1) the traceability of the selection mechanism execution and 2) the coordination among the selected UAVs, which is currently offered in a centralized manner and is not coupled with the relay selection. Existing UAV coordination methods often rely on optimization methods, which are not adaptable to different environment complexities, or on centralized deep reinforcement learning, which lacks scalability in multi-UAV settings. Overall, there is a need for a comprehensive framework where relay selection and coordination are coupled and executed in a transparent and trusted manner. This work proposes a framework empowered by reinforcement learning and Blockchain for UAV-assisted IoV networks. It consists of three main components: a two-sided UAV relay selection mechanism for UAV-assisted IoV, a decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MDRL) model for autonomous UAV coordination, and a Blockchain implementation for transparency and traceability in the interactions between vehicles and UAVs. The relay selection considers the two-sided preferences of vehicles and UAVs based on the Quality-of-UAV (QoU) and the Quality-of-Vehicle (QoV). Upon selection of relay UAVs, the decentralized coordination between them is enabled through an MDRL model trained to control their mobility and maintain the network coverage and connectivity using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed selection and coordination mechanisms improve the stability of the selected relays and maximize the coverage and connectivity achieved by the UAVs.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advancement of technology and changes in the market, the demand for the construction of domain-specific knowledge bases has been increasing, either to improve model performance or to promote enterprise innovation and competitiveness. The construction of domain-specific knowledge bases typically relies on web crawlers or existing industry databases, leading to problems with accuracy and consistency of the data. To address these challenges, we considered the characteristics of domain data, where internal knowledge is interconnected, and proposed the Self-Natural Language Inference Data Filtering (self-nli-TDF) framework. This framework compares trusted filtered knowledge with the data to be filtered, deducing the reasoning relationship between them, thus improving filtering performance. The framework uses plug-and-play large language models for trustworthiness assessment and employs the RoBERTa-MNLI model from the NLI domain for reasoning. We constructed three datasets in the domains of biology, radiation, and science, and conducted experiments using RoBERTa, GPT3.5, and the local Qwen2 model. The experimental results show that this framework improves filter quality, producing more consistent and reliable filtering results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cary Coglianese, Colton R. Crum</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) exacerbate a core regulatory challenge associated with AI: its heterogeneity. By their very nature, foundation models and generative AI can perform multiple functions for their users, thus presenting a vast array of different risks. This multifunctionality means that prescriptive, one-size-fits-all regulation will not be a viable option. Even performance standards and ex post liability - regulatory approaches that usually afford flexibility - are unlikely to be strong candidates for responding to multifunctional AI's risks, given challenges in monitoring and enforcement. Regulators will do well instead to promote proactive risk management on the part of developers and users by using management-based regulation, an approach that has proven effective in other contexts of heterogeneity. Regulators will also need to maintain ongoing vigilance and agility. More than in other contexts, regulators of multifunctional AI will need sufficient resources, top human talent and leadership, and organizational cultures committed to regulatory excellence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas A. Caputo</p>
<p>Abstract: This year, jurisdictions worldwide, including the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China, are set to enact or revise laws governing frontier AI. Their efforts largely rely on the assumption that increasing model scale through pretraining is the path to more advanced AI capabilities. Yet growing evidence suggests that this "pretraining paradigm" may be hitting a wall and major AI companies are turning to alternative approaches, like inference-time "reasoning," to boost capabilities instead.
  This paradigm shift presents fundamental challenges for the frontier AI governance frameworks that target pretraining scale as a key bottleneck useful for monitoring, control, and exclusion, threatening to undermine this new legal order as it emerges. This essay seeks to identify these challenges and point to new paths forward for regulation. First, we examine the existing frontier AI regulatory regime and analyze some key traits and vulnerabilities. Second, we introduce the concept of the "pretraining frontier," the capabilities threshold made possible by scaling up pretraining alone, and demonstrate how it could make the regulatory field more diffuse and complex and lead to new forms of competition. Third, we lay out a regulatory approach that focuses on increasing transparency and leveraging new natural technical bottlenecks to effectively oversee changing frontier AI development while minimizing regulatory burdens and protecting fundamental rights. Our analysis provides concrete mechanisms for governing frontier AI systems across diverse technical paradigms, offering policymakers tools for addressing both current and future regulatory challenges in frontier AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Loyal AI is loyal to the community that builds it. An AI is loyal to a community if the community has ownership, alignment, and control. Community owned models can only be used with the approval of the community and share the economic rewards communally. Community aligned models have values that are aligned with the consensus of the community. Community controlled models perform functions designed by the community. Since we would like permissionless access to the loyal AI's community, we need the AI to be open source. The key scientific question then is: how can we build models that are openly accessible (open source) and yet are owned and governed by the community. This seeming impossibility is the focus of this paper where we outline a concrete pathway to Open, Monetizable and Loyal models (OML), building on our earlier work on OML, arXiv:2411.03887(1) , and a representation via a cryptographic-ML library http://github.com/sentient-agi/oml-1.0-fingerprinting .</p>

<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of AI in science necessitates efficient and scalable solutions for retrieving and preserving research information. Here, we present a tool for the development of a customized question-answer (QA) dataset, called Interactive Trained Research Innovator (iTRI) - QA, tailored for the needs of researchers leveraging language models (LMs) to retrieve scientific knowledge in a QA format. Our approach integrates curated QA datasets with a specialized research paper dataset to enhance responses' contextual relevance and accuracy using fine-tuned LM. The framework comprises four key steps: (1) the generation of high-quality and human-generated QA examples, (2) the creation of a structured research paper database, (3) the fine-tuning of LMs using domain-specific QA examples, and (4) the generation of QA dataset that align with user queries and the curated database. This pipeline provides a dynamic and domain-specific QA system that augments the utility of LMs in academic research that will be applied for future research LM deployment. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of our tool for streamlining knowledge retrieval in scientific contexts, paving the way for its integration into broader multi-disciplinary applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Gurawa, Anjali Dharmik</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, the performance of various predictive models, including probabilistic baseline, CNN, LSTM, and finetuned LLMs, in forecasting merchant categories from financial transaction data have been evaluated. Utilizing datasets from Bank A for training and Bank B for testing, the superior predictive capabilities of the fine-tuned Mistral Instruct model, which was trained using customer data converted into natural language format have been demonstrated. The methodology of this study involves instruction fine-tuning Mistral via LoRA (LowRank Adaptation of Large Language Models) to adapt its vast pre-trained knowledge to the specific domain of financial transactions. The Mistral model significantly outperforms traditional sequential models, achieving higher F1 scores in the three key merchant categories of bank transaction data (grocery, clothing, and gas stations) that is crucial for targeted marketing campaigns. This performance is attributed to the model's enhanced semantic understanding and adaptability which enables it to better manage minority classes and predict transaction categories with greater accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in predicting human behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to evaluate the efficiency of a RAG-based agentic Large Language Model (LLM) architecture in network packet seed generation for network protocol fuzzing. Enhanced by chain-of-thought (COT) prompting techniques, the proposed approach focuses on the improvement of the seeds structural quality in order to guide protocol fuzzing frameworks through a wide exploration of the protocol state space. Our method leverages RAG and text embeddings in a two-stages. In the first stage, the agent dynamically refers to the Request For Comments (RFC) documents knowledge base for answering queries regarding the protocol Finite State Machine (FSM), then it iteratively reasons through the retrieved knowledge, for output refinement and proper seed placement. In the second stage, we evaluate the response structure quality of the agent's output, based on metrics as BLEU, ROUGE, and Word Error Rate (WER) by comparing the generated packets against the ground truth packets. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements of up to 18.19%, 14.81%, and 23.45% in BLEU, ROUGE, and WER, respectively, over baseline models. These results confirm the potential of such approach, improving LLM-based protocol fuzzing frameworks for the identification of hidden vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring data quality in large tabular datasets is a critical challenge, typically addressed through data wrangling tasks. Traditional statistical methods, though efficient, cannot often understand the semantic context and deep learning approaches are resource-intensive, requiring task and dataset-specific training. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an automated system that utilizes large language models to generate executable code for tasks like missing value imputation, error detection, and error correction. Our system aims to identify inherent patterns in the data while leveraging external knowledge, effectively addressing both memory-dependent and memory-independent tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Agarwal, Sai Sundaresan, Subrata Mitra, Debabrata Mahapatra, Archit Gupta, Rounak Sharma, Nirmal Joshua Kapu, Tong Yu, Shiv Saini</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is often used with Large Language Models (LLMs) to infuse domain knowledge or user-specific information. In RAG, given a user query, a retriever extracts chunks of relevant text from a knowledge base. These chunks are sent to an LLM as part of the input prompt. Typically, any given chunk is repeatedly retrieved across user questions. However, currently, for every question, attention-layers in LLMs fully compute the key values (KVs) repeatedly for the input chunks, as state-of-the-art methods cannot reuse KV-caches when chunks appear at arbitrary locations with arbitrary contexts. Naive reuse leads to output quality degradation. This leads to potentially redundant computations on expensive GPUs and increases latency. In this work, we propose Cache-Craft, a system for managing and reusing precomputed KVs corresponding to the text chunks (we call chunk-caches) in RAG-based systems. We present how to identify chunk-caches that are reusable, how to efficiently perform a small fraction of recomputation to fix the cache to maintain output quality, and how to efficiently store and evict chunk-caches in the hardware for maximizing reuse while masking any overheads. With real production workloads as well as synthetic datasets, we show that Cache-Craft reduces redundant computation by 51% over SOTA prefix-caching and 75% over full recomputation. Additionally, with continuous batching on a real production workload, we get a 1.6X speed up in throughput and a 2X reduction in end-to-end response latency over prefix-caching while maintaining quality, for both the LLaMA-3-8B and LLaMA-3-70B models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Peng, Xin Wu, Lianming Xu, Li Wang, Aiguo Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed DNN inference is becoming increasingly important as the demand for intelligent services at the network edge grows. By leveraging the power of distributed computing, edge devices can perform complicated and resource-hungry inference tasks previously only possible on powerful servers, enabling new applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart homes. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate and efficient distributed edge inference due to the fluctuating nature of the actual resources of the devices and the processing difficulty of the input data. In this work, we propose DistrEE, a distributed DNN inference framework that can exit model inference early to meet specific quality of service requirements. In particular, the framework firstly integrates model early exit and distributed inference for multi-node collaborative inferencing scenarios. Furthermore, it designs an early exit policy to control when the model inference terminates. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that DistrEE can efficiently realize efficient collaborative inference, achieving an effective trade-off between inference latency and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Rey, Ana M. Bernardos, Andrzej D. Dobrzycki, David Carrami\~nana, Luca Bergesio, Juan A. Besada, Jos\'e Ram\'on Casar</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enhanced the capabilities of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) in computer vision. However, the integration of AI techniques o-nboard drones is constrained by their processing capabilities. In this sense, this study evaluates the deployment of object detection models (YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s) on both resource-constrained edge devices and cloud environments. The objective is to carry out a comparative performance analysis using a representative real-time UAV image processing pipeline. Specifically, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, Orin NX, and Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI5) devices have been tested to measure their detection accuracy, inference speed, and energy consumption, and the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ). The results show that YOLOv8n surpasses YOLOv8s in its inference speed, achieving 52 FPS on the Jetson Orin NX and 65 fps with INT8 quantization. Conversely, the RPI5 failed to satisfy the real-time processing needs in spite of its suitability for low-energy consumption applications. An analysis of both the cloud-based and edge-based end-to-end processing times showed that increased communication latencies hindered real-time applications, revealing trade-offs between edge (low latency) and cloud processing (quick processing). Overall, these findings contribute to providing recommendations and optimization strategies for the deployment of AI models on UAVs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently used extensively to generate code by professionals and students, motivating the development of tools to detect LLM-generated code for applications such as academic integrity and cybersecurity. We address this authorship attribution problem as a binary classification task along with feature identification and extraction. We propose new Discretized Nested Bigram Frequency features on source code groups of various sizes.

Experimental evaluation demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed a commonly used GPT code-detection API and baseline features, with accuracy exceeding 96% compared to 72% and 79% respectively in detecting GPT-rewritten Java code fragments for 976 files with GPT 3.5 and GPT4 using 12 features. We also outperformed three prior works on code author identification in a 40-author dataset. Our approach scales well to larger data sets, and we achieved 99% accuracy and 0.999 AUC for 76,089 files and over 1,000 authors with GPT 4o using 227 features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonghyuk Hahn, Hyeseon Ahn, Jungin Kim, Soohan Lim, Yo-Sub Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Time complexity is a theoretic measure to determine the amount of time the algorithm needs for its execution. In reality, developers write algorithms into code snippets within limited resources, making the calculation of a code's time complexity a fundamental task. However, determining the precise time complexity of a code is theoretically undecidable. In response, recent advancements have leaned toward deploying datasets for code time complexity prediction and initiating preliminary experiments for this challenge. We investigate the challenge in low-resource scenarios where only a few labeled instances are given for training. Remarkably, we are the first to introduce TCProF: a Time-Complexity Prediction SSL Framework as an effective solution for code time complexity prediction in low-resource settings. TCProF significantly boosts performance by integrating our augmentation, symbolic modules, and a co-training mechanism, achieving a more than 60% improvement over self-training approaches. We further provide an extensive comparative analysis between TCProF, ChatGPT, and Gemini-Pro, offering a detailed evaluation of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Text2Net, an innovative text-based network simulation engine that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to transform plain-text descriptions of network topologies into dynamic, interactive simulations. Text2Net simplifies the process of configuring network simulations, eliminating the need for users to master vendor-specific syntaxes or navigate complex graphical interfaces.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matilde Valente, Tiago C. Dias, Vasco Guerra, Rodrigo Ventura</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven machine learning models often require extensive datasets, which can be costly or inaccessible, and their predictions may fail to comply with established physical laws. Current approaches for incorporating physical priors mitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in physics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that automatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do not guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and invariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality. We propose a novel physics-consistent machine learning method that directly enforces compliance with physical principles by projecting model outputs onto the manifold defined by these laws. This procedure ensures that predictions inherently adhere to the chosen physical constraints, improving reliability and interpretability. Our method is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a low-temperature reactive plasma. Compared to purely data-driven models, our approach significantly reduces errors in physical law compliance, enhances predictive accuracy of physical quantities, and outperforms alternatives when working with simpler models or limited datasets. The proposed projection-based technique is versatile and can function independently or in conjunction with existing physics-informed neural networks, offering a powerful, general, and scalable solution for developing fast and reliable surrogate models of complex physical systems, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Berti, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Stock Price Trend Prediction (SPTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and struggle to reliably predict short-term trends. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. To assess TLOB's effectiveness, we evaluate it on the well-known FI-2010 benchmark (F1 of 92.8\%) and on Tesla (+2.67\% on F1) and Intel (+14.16\% on F1). Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time (-6.68 absolute points in F1), highlighting the growing market efficiencies. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.</p>

<p>Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we deploy 17 LLMs across four XR devices--Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. We devise an experimental setup and evaluate performance on four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We finally propose a unified evaluation method based on the Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from the quality and speed objectives. We believe our findings offer valuable insights to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be followed as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field. All supplemental materials are available at www.nanovis.org/Loxr.html.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes smart city domains such as healthcare, transportation, industry, and education. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining prominence, particularly in smart hospitals and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). The vast volume of data generated by IoMT devices should be analyzed in real-time for health surveillance, prognosis, and prediction of diseases. Current approaches relying on Cloud computing to provide the necessary computing and storage capabilities do not scale for these latency-sensitive applications. Edge computing emerges as a solution by bringing cloud services closer to IoMT devices. This paper introduces SmartEdge, an AI-powered smart healthcare end-to-end integrated edge and cloud computing system for diabetes prediction. This work addresses latency concerns and demonstrates the efficacy of edge resources in healthcare applications within an end-to-end system. The system leverages various risk factors for diabetes prediction. We propose an Edge and Cloud-enabled framework to deploy the proposed diabetes prediction models on various configurations using edge nodes and main cloud servers. Performance metrics are evaluated using, latency, accuracy, and response time. By using ensemble machine learning voting algorithms we can improve the prediction accuracy by 5% versus a single model prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Pang, Kai Li, Ruifeng She, Feifan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), it has become increasingly important to optimize hardware usage and improve throughput. In this paper, we study the inference optimization of the serving system that deploys LLMs. To optimize system throughput and maximize hardware utilization, we formulate the inference optimization problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and propose a hybrid offline-online method as solution. The offline method improves large-scale inference systems by introducing a Minimizing Makespan Bin Packing Problem. We further provide a theoretical lower bound computation method. Then, we propose an online sorting and preemptive scheduling method to better utilize hardware. In the online iteration scheduling process, a Lagrangian method is applied to evaluate the cost efficiency of inserting prefill stages versus decode stages at each iteration and dynamically determine when to preempt decoding tasks and insert prefill tasks. Experiments using real-world data from the LLaMA-65B model and the GSM8K dataset demonstrate that system utilization improves from 80.2% to 89.1%, and the total inference time decreases from 201.00 to 190.58 seconds. A 100-cases study shows that our method consistently outperforms the baseline method and improves the utilization rate by 8.0% on average. Finally, we discuss potential future extensions, including stochastic modeling, reinforcement learning-based schedulers, and dynamic decision-making strategies for system throughput and hardware utilization.</p>

<p>Abstract: The removal of leaked radioactive iodine isotopes in humid environments holds significant importance in nuclear waste management and nuclear accident mitigation. In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOFs and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOFs. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features and 8 chemical features were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOFs were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms. This work combined high-throughput computation, machine learning, and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted factors influencing the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs, offering profound insightful guidelines for screening and structural design of advanced MOF materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Wang, Xufeng Zhang, Xiaoyu Zhang, Zhenhuan Ding, Chaoxu Mu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Gumbel AlphaZero~(GAZ) was proposed to solve classic combinatorial optimization problems such as TSP and JSSP by creating a carefully designed competition model~(consisting of a learning player and a competitor player), which leverages the idea of self-play. However, if the competitor is too strong or too weak, the effectiveness of self-play training can be reduced, particularly in complex CO problems. To address this problem, we further propose a two-stage self-play strategy to improve the GAZ method~(named TSS GAZ PTP). In the first stage, the learning player uses the enhanced policy network based on the Gumbel Monte Carlo Tree Search~(MCTS), and the competitor uses the historical best trained policy network~(acts as a greedy player). In the second stage, we employ Gumbel MCTS for both players, which makes the competition fiercer so that both players can continuously learn smarter trajectories. We first investigate the performance of our proposed TSS GAZ PTP method on TSP since it is also used as a test problem by the original GAZ. The results show the superior performance of TSS GAZ PTP. Then we extend TSS GAZ PTP to deal with multi-constrained Electric Vehicle Routing Problems~(EVRP), which is a recently well-known real application research topic and remains challenging as a complex CO problem. Impressively, the experimental results show that the TSS GAZ PTP outperforms the state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning methods in all types of instances tested and outperforms the optimization solver in tested large-scale instances, indicating the importance and promising of employing more dynamic self-play strategies for complex CO problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Wang, Chen Weidong, Huang Zhifeng, Md Raisul Islam, Chua Kian Jon</p>
<p>Abstract: In tropical countries with high humidity, air conditioning can account for up to 60% of a building's energy use. For commercial buildings with centralized systems, the efficiency of the chiller plant is vital, and model predictive control provides an effective strategy for optimizing operations through dynamic adjustments based on accurate load predictions. Artificial neural networks are effective for modelling nonlinear systems but are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Effective feature engineering can mitigate this issue. While weather data are crucial for load prediction, they are often used as raw numerical inputs without advanced processing. Clustering features is a technique that can reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Although previous studies have explored clustering algorithms for load prediction, none have applied them to multidimensional weather data, revealing a research gap. This study presents a cooling load prediction model that combines a neural network with Kalman filtering and K-means clustering. Applied to real world data from a commercial skyscraper in Singapore's central business district, the model achieved a 46.5% improvement in prediction accuracy. An optimal chiller sequencing strategy was also developed through genetic algorithm optimization of the predictive load, potentially saving 13.8% in energy. Finally, the study evaluated the integration of thermal energy storage into the chiller plant design, demonstrating potential reductions in capital and operational costs of 26% and 13%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhilash Neog, Arka Daw, Sepideh Fatemi Khorasgani, Anuj Karpatne</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant challenge in time-series (TS) modeling is the presence of missing values in real-world TS datasets. Traditional two-stage frameworks, involving imputation followed by modeling, suffer from two key drawbacks: (1) the propagation of imputation errors into subsequent TS modeling, (2) the trade-offs between imputation efficacy and imputation complexity. While one-stage approaches attempt to address these limitations, they often struggle with scalability or fully leveraging partially observed features. To this end, we propose a novel imputation-free approach for handling missing values in time series termed Missing Feature-aware Time Series Modeling (MissTSM) with two main innovations. First, we develop a novel embedding scheme that treats every combination of time-step and feature (or channel) as a distinct token. Second, we introduce a novel Missing Feature-Aware Attention (MFAA) Layer to learn latent representations at every time-step based on partially observed features. We evaluate the effectiveness of MissTSM in handling missing values over multiple benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Qiu, Zheng Huang, Haoyu Hu, Aosong Feng, Yujun Yan, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals into text has been a key challenge in the neuroscience community, with the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces and uncover deeper insights into brain mechanisms. However, existing approaches often struggle with suboptimal predictive performance, limited task variety, and poor generalization across subjects. In response to this, we propose MindLLM, a model designed for subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding. MindLLM consists of an fMRI encoder and an off-the-shelf LLM. The fMRI encoder employs a neuroscience-informed attention mechanism, which is capable of accommodating subjects with varying input shapes and thus achieves high-performance subject-agnostic decoding. Moreover, we introduce Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), a novel approach that enhances the model's ability to capture diverse semantic representations from fMRI signals, facilitating more versatile decoding. We evaluate MindLLM on comprehensive fMRI-to-text benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines, improving downstream tasks by 12.0%, unseen subject generalization by 16.4%, and novel task adaptation by 25.0%. Furthermore, the attention patterns in MindLLM provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Saikumar, Blesson Varghese</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network pruning is essential for reducing model complexity to enable deployment on resource constrained hardware. While performance loss of pruned networks is often attributed to the removal of critical parameters, we identify signal collapse a reduction in activation variance across layers as the root cause. Existing one shot pruning methods focus on weight selection strategies and rely on computationally expensive second order approximations. In contrast, we demonstrate that mitigating signal collapse, rather than optimizing weight selection, is key to improving accuracy of pruned networks. We propose REFLOW that addresses signal collapse without updating trainable weights, revealing high quality sparse sub networks within the original parameter space. REFLOW enables magnitude pruning to achieve state of the art performance, restoring ResNeXt101 accuracy from under 4.1% to 78.9% on ImageNet with only 20% of the weights retained, surpassing state of the art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sirui Li, Wenbin Ouyang, Yining Ma, Cathy Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-horizon combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), such as the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), often involve complex, interdependent decisions over extended time frames, posing significant challenges for existing solvers. While Rolling Horizon Optimization (RHO) addresses this by decomposing problems into overlapping shorter-horizon subproblems, such overlap often involves redundant computations. In this paper, we present L-RHO, the first learning-guided RHO framework for COPs. L-RHO employs a neural network to intelligently fix variables that in hindsight did not need to be re-optimized, resulting in smaller and thus easier-to-solve subproblems. For FJSP, this means identifying operations with unchanged machine assignments between consecutive subproblems. Applied to FJSP, L-RHO accelerates RHO by up to 54% while significantly improving solution quality, outperforming other heuristic and learning-based baselines. We also provide in-depth discussions and verify the desirable adaptability and generalization of L-RHO across numerous FJSP variates, distributions, online scenarios and benchmark instances. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis to elucidate the conditions under which learning is beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong W. Xu, Wenhao Li, Scott Sanner, Elias B. Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a Transformer-based framework for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). CSPs find use in many applications and thus accelerating their solution with machine learning is of wide interest. Most existing approaches rely on supervised learning from feasible solutions or reinforcement learning, paradigms that require either feasible solutions to these NP-Complete CSPs or large training budgets and a complex expert-designed reward signal. To address these challenges, we propose ConsFormer, a self-supervised framework that leverages a Transformer as a solution refiner. ConsFormer constructs a solution to a CSP iteratively in a process that mimics local search. Instead of using feasible solutions as labeled data, we devise differentiable approximations to the discrete constraints of a CSP to guide model training. Our model is trained to improve random assignments for a single step but is deployed iteratively at test time, circumventing the bottlenecks of supervised and reinforcement learning. Our method can tackle out-of-distribution CSPs simply through additional iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Kouremetis, Marissa Dotter, Alex Byrne, Dan Martin, Ethan Michalak, Gianpaolo Russo, Michael Threet, Guido Zarrella</p>
<p>Abstract: The prospect of artificial intelligence (AI) competing in the adversarial landscape of cyber security has long been considered one of the most impactful, challenging, and potentially dangerous applications of AI. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to assessing AI's progress towards enabling and scaling real-world offensive cyber operations (OCO) tactics in use by modern threat actors. We detail OCCULT, a lightweight operational evaluation framework that allows cyber security experts to contribute to rigorous and repeatable measurement of the plausible cyber security risks associated with any given large language model (LLM) or AI employed for OCO. We also prototype and evaluate three very different OCO benchmarks for LLMs that demonstrate our approach and serve as examples for building benchmarks under the OCCULT framework. Finally, we provide preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate how this framework allows us to move beyond traditional all-or-nothing tests, such as those crafted from educational exercises like capture-the-flag environments, to contextualize our indicators and warnings in true cyber threat scenarios that present risks to modern infrastructure. We find that there has been significant recent advancement in the risks of AI being used to scale realistic cyber threats. For the first time, we find a model (DeepSeek-R1) is capable of correctly answering over 90% of challenging offensive cyber knowledge tests in our Threat Actor Competency Test for LLMs (TACTL) multiple-choice benchmarks. We also show how Meta's Llama and Mistral's Mixtral model families show marked performance improvements over earlier models against our benchmarks where LLMs act as offensive agents in MITRE's high-fidelity offensive and defensive cyber operations simulation environment, CyberLayer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhou, Heng Li, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Xudong Yan, Mario Fritz, Margret Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to curb overconfidence in neural network predictions and enhance generalization. However, previous research shows that LS can force feature representations into excessively tight clusters, eroding intra-class distinctions. More recent findings suggest that LS also induces overconfidence in misclassifications, yet the precise mechanism remained unclear. In this work, we decompose the loss term introduced by LS, revealing two key components: (i) a regularization term that functions only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-enhancement term that emerges under misclassifications. This latter term compels the model to reinforce incorrect predictions with exaggerated certainty, further collapsing the feature space. To address these issues, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which uniformly applies the intended regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit instead of the ground-truth logit. Through feature analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Extensive experiments on image classification and downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for addressing modern challenges and enabling practical applications. However, their computational expense remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique to democratize access and enable low resource device deployment. Despite these advancements, the safety and trustworthiness of quantized models remain underexplored, as prior studies often overlook contemporary architectures and rely on overly simplistic benchmarks and evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce OpenSafetyMini, a novel open-ended safety dataset designed to better distinguish between models. We evaluate 4 state-of-the-art quantization techniques across LLaMA and Mistral models using 4 benchmarks, including human evaluations. Our findings reveal that the optimal quantization method varies for 4-bit precision, while vector quantization techniques deliver the best safety and trustworthiness performance at 2-bit precision, providing foundation for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compositional generalization-the systematic combination of known components into novel structures-remains a core challenge in cognitive science and machine learning. Although transformer-based large language models can exhibit strong performance on certain compositional tasks, the underlying mechanisms driving these abilities remain opaque, calling into question their interpretability. In this work, we identify and mechanistically interpret the circuit responsible for compositional induction in a compact transformer. Using causal ablations, we validate the circuit and formalize its operation using a program-like description. We further demonstrate that this mechanistic understanding enables precise activation edits to steer the model's behavior predictably. Our findings advance the understanding of complex behaviors in transformers and highlight such insights can provide a direct pathway for model control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Zhang, Daning Cheng, Yunquan Zhang, Meiqi Tu, Fangmin Liu, Jiake Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth in parameter size and computational complexity of deep models poses significant challenges for efficient deployment. The core problem of existing compression methods is that different layers of the model have significant differences in their tolerance to compression levels. For instance, the first layer of a model can typically sustain a higher compression level compared to the last layer without compromising performance. Thus, the key challenge lies in how to allocate compression levels across layers in a way that minimizes performance loss while maximizing parameter reduction. To address this challenge, we propose a Compression Error Theory (CET) framework, designed to determine the optimal compression level for each layer. Taking quantization as an example, CET leverages differential expansion and algebraic geometry to reconstruct the quadratic form of quantization error as ellipsoids and hyperbolic paraboloids, and utilizes their geometric structures to define an error subspace. To identify the error subspace with minimal performance loss, by performing orthogonal decomposition of the geometric space, CET transforms the optimization process of the error subspace into a complementary problem. The final theoretical analysis shows that constructing the quantization subspace along the major axis results in minimal performance degradation. Through experimental verification of the theory, CET can greatly retain performance while compressing. Specifically, on the ResNet-34 model, CET achieves nearly 11$\times$ parameter compression while even surpassing performance comparable to the original model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingzhe Zhao, Ke Cheng, Aomufei Yuan, Yuxuan Tian, Ruiguang Zhong, Chengchen Hu, Tong Yang, Lian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: KV cache techniques in Transformer models aim to reduce redundant computations at the expense of substantially increased memory usage, making KV cache compression an important and popular research topic. Recently, state-of-the-art KV cache compression methods implement imbalanced, per-head allocation algorithms that dynamically adjust the KV cache budget for each attention head, achieving excellent performance in single-GPU scenarios. However, we observe that such imbalanced compression leads to significant load imbalance when deploying multi-GPU inference, as some GPUs become overburdened while others remain underutilized. In this paper, we propose FairKV, a method designed to ensure fair memory usage among attention heads in systems employing imbalanced KV cache compression. The core technique of FairKV is Fair-Copying, which replicates a small subset of memory-intensive attention heads across GPUs using data parallelism to mitigate load imbalance. Our experiments on popular models, including LLaMA 70b and Mistral 24b model, demonstrate that FairKV increases throughput by 1.66x compared to standard tensor parallelism inference. Our code will be released as open source upon acceptance.</p>

Notably, FragFM achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity. These results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yao, Xuan Tong, Ruofan Wang, Yixu Wang, Lujundong Li, Liang Liu, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, claude-sonnet and gemini-thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking claude-sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on SemEval-2020 Task 4 dataset, focusing on commonsense validation and explanation. Our methodology involves evaluating multiple LLMs, including LLaMA3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Mixtral-8x7B, using zero-shot prompting techniques. The models are tested on two tasks: Task A (Commonsense Validation), where models determine whether a statement aligns with commonsense knowledge, and Task B (Commonsense Explanation), where models identify the reasoning behind implausible statements. Performance is assessed based on accuracy, and results are compared to fine-tuned transformer-based models. The results indicate that larger models outperform previous models and perform closely to human evaluation for Task A, with LLaMA3-70B achieving the highest accuracy of 98.40% in Task A whereas, lagging behind previous models with 93.40% in Task B. However, while models effectively identify implausible statements, they face challenges in selecting the most relevant explanation, highlighting limitations in causal and inferential reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an attractive and energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their sparse binary activation.

We introduce the Hybrid Dynamics Integrate-and-Fire Neuron (HD-IF), designed to simulate selective neuron activation and reduce over-reliance on specific artificial neurons. SPT attains state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets that span both real-world and synthetic datasets in the SNN domain. Meanwhile, the theoretical energy consumption of SPT is at least 6.4$\times$ less than its ANN counterpart.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of multimodal language models, understanding the nuanced meanings conveyed through visual cues - such as satire, insult, or critique - remains a significant challenge. Existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on direct tasks like image captioning or are limited to a narrow set of categories, such as humor or satire, for deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we introduce, for the first time, a comprehensive, multi-level Chinese-based benchmark designed specifically for evaluating the understanding of implicit meanings in images. This benchmark is systematically categorized into four subtasks: surface-level content understanding, symbolic meaning interpretation, background knowledge comprehension, and implicit meaning comprehension. We propose an innovative semi-automatic method for constructing datasets, adhering to established construction protocols. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 15 open-source large vision language models (LVLMs) and GPT-4o, revealing that even the best-performing model lags behind human performance by nearly 14% in understanding implicit meaning. Our findings underscore the intrinsic challenges current LVLMs face in grasping nuanced visual semantics, highlighting significant opportunities for future research and development in this domain. We will publicly release our InsightVision dataset, code upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid model that integrates long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to significantly enhance the accuracy of stock market predictions. The LSTM component adeptly captures temporal patterns in stock price data, effectively modeling the time series dynamics of financial markets. Concurrently, the GNN component leverages Pearson correlation and association analysis to model inter-stock relational data, capturing complex nonlinear polyadic dependencies influencing stock prices. The model is trained and evaluated using an expanding window validation approach, enabling continuous learning from increasing amounts of data and adaptation to evolving market conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on historical stock data demonstrate that our hybrid LSTM-GNN model achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.00144, representing a substantial reduction of 10.6% compared to the MSE of the standalone LSTM model of 0.00161. Furthermore, the hybrid model outperforms traditional and advanced benchmarks, including linear regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and dense networks. These compelling results underscore the significant potential of combining temporal and relational data through a hybrid approach, offering a powerful tool for real-time trading and financial analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the capability of AI to solve problems in theoretical physics, focusing on high-energy theory and cosmology. The first iteration of our benchmark consists of 57 problems of varying difficulty, from undergraduate to research level. These problems are novel in the sense that they do not come from public problem collections. We evaluate our data set on various open and closed language models, including o3-mini, o1, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o and versions of Llama and Qwen. While we find impressive progress in model performance with the most recent models, our research-level difficulty problems are mostly unsolved. We address challenges of auto-verifiability and grading, and discuss common failure modes. While currently state-of-the art models are still of limited use for researchers, our results show that AI assisted theoretical physics research may become possible in the near future. We discuss the main obstacles towards this goal and possible strategies to overcome them. The public problems and solutions, results for various models, and updates to the data set and score distribution, are available on the website of the dataset tpbench.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keane Ong, Rui Mao, Deeksha Varshney, Erik Cambria, Gianmarco Mengaldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental, social and governance, ESG performance, but their content is increasingly obscured by greenwashing - sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Yet, existing NLP approaches for ESG analysis lack robustness against greenwashing risks, often extracting insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce A3CG - Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Tyler Wong, Sun Fei, Liangming Pan, Adam Jardine, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Montgomery Alban, Ehsan Ahmadi, Randy Goebel, Amir Rasouli</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion planning is a fundamental problem in autonomous driving and perhaps the most challenging to comprehensively evaluate because of the associated risks and expenses of real-world deployment. Therefore, simulations play an important role in efficient development of planning algorithms. To be effective, simulations must be accurate and realistic, both in terms of dynamics and behavior modeling, and also highly customizable in order to accommodate a broad spectrum of research frameworks. In this paper, we introduce SMARTS 2.0, the second generation of our motion planning simulator which, in addition to being highly optimized for large-scale simulation, provides many new features, such as realistic map integration, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, traffic and pedestrian simulation, and a broad variety of sensor models.
  Moreover, we present a novel benchmark suite for evaluating planning algorithms in various highly challenging scenarios, including interactive driving, such as turning at intersections, and adaptive driving, in which the task is to closely follow a lead vehicle without any explicit knowledge of its intention. Each scenario is characterized by a variety of traffic patterns and road structures. We further propose a series of common and task-specific metrics to effectively evaluate the performance of the planning algorithms. At the end, we evaluate common motion planning algorithms using the proposed benchmark and highlight the challenges the proposed scenarios impose. The new SMARTS 2.0 features and the benchmark are publicly available at github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Umer Qayyum, Muhammad Fahad, Nasrullah Abbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: In oncology, recurrence after treatment is one of the major challenges, related to patients' survival and quality of life. Conventionally, prediction of cancer relapse has always relied on clinical observation with statistical model support, which almost fails to explain the complex, multifactorial nature of tumor recurrence. This research explores how AI and ML models may increase the accuracy and reliability of recurrence prediction in cancer. Therefore, AI and ML create new opportunities not only for personalized medicine but also for proactive management of patients through analyzing large volumes of data on genetics, clinical manifestations, and treatment. The paper describes the various AI and ML techniques for pattern identification and outcome prediction in cancer patients using supervised and unsupervised learning. Clinical implications provide an opportunity to review how early interventions could happen and the design of treatment planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahyun Jung, Jaehyung Seo, Jaewook Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often retain outdated or incorrect information from pre-training, which undermines their reliability. While model editing methods have been developed to address such errors without full re-training, they frequently suffer from knowledge conflicts, where outdated information interferes with new knowledge. In this work, we propose Conflict-free Model Editing (CoME), a novel framework that enhances the accuracy of knowledge updates in LLMs by selectively removing outdated knowledge. CoME leverages unlearning to mitigate knowledge interference, allowing new information to be integrated without compromising relevant linguistic features. Through experiments on GPT-J and LLaMA-3 using Counterfact and ZsRE datasets, we demonstrate that CoME improves both editing accuracy and model reliability when applied to existing editing methods. Our results highlight that the targeted removal of outdated knowledge is crucial for enhancing model editing effectiveness and maintaining the model's generative performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parichat Suknark, Sompote Youwaib, Tipok Kitkobsin, Sirintornthep Towprayoon, Chart Chiemchaisri, Komsilp Wangyao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of shear strength parameters in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) remains a critical challenge in geotechnical engineering due to the heterogeneous nature of waste materials and their temporal evolution through degradation processes. This paper presents a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for evaluating cohesion and friction angle across diverse MSW compositional profiles. The proposed model integrates a multi-layer perceptron architecture with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to provide transparent insights into how specific waste components influence strength characteristics. Training data encompassed large-scale direct shear tests across various waste compositions and degradation states. The model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional gradient boosting methods, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of 7.42% and 14.96% for friction angle and cohesion predictions, respectively. Through SHAP analysis, the study revealed that fibrous materials and particle size distribution were primary drivers of shear strength variation, with food waste and plastics showing significant but non-linear effects. The model's explainability component successfully quantified these relationships, enabling evidence-based recommendations for waste management practices. This research bridges the gap between advanced machine learning and geotechnical engineering practice, offering a reliable tool for rapid assessment of MSW mechanical properties while maintaining interpretability for engineering decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyang Sun, Yihao Wang, Tao Feng, Dan Zhang, Yifan Zhu, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to streamline the fine-tuning of foundation models, Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have been substantially adopted across various fields, including instruction tuning and domain adaptation. The underlying concept of LoRA involves decomposing a full-rank matrix into the product of two lower-rank matrices, which reduces storage consumption and accelerates the training process. Furthermore, to address the limited expressive capacity of LoRA, the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) has been introduced for incorporating multiple LoRA adapters. The integration of LoRA experts leads to a visible improvement across several downstream scenes. However, the mixture of LoRAs (MoE-LoRA) still exhibits its low robustness during tuning and inferring. Inspired by the Riemannian Preconditioners which train LoRA as a sub-space projector, we propose a new training strategy for MoE-LoRA, to stabilize and boost its feature learning procedure by multi-space projections. Examinations on SGD and AdamW optimizers demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology. Source code is available at https://github.com/THUDM/MoELoRA_Riemannian.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weisong Sun, Yuchen Chen, Mengzhe Yuan, Chunrong Fang, Zhenpeng Chen, Chong Wang, Yang Liu, Baowen Xu, Zhenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural code models (NCMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in code intelligence tasks. Meanwhile, the security of NCMs and NCMs-based systems has garnered increasing attention. In particular, NCMs are often trained on large-scale data from potentially untrustworthy sources, providing attackers with the opportunity to manipulate them by inserting crafted samples into the data. This type of attack is called a code poisoning attack (also known as a backdoor attack). It allows attackers to implant backdoors in NCMs and thus control model behavior, which poses a significant security threat. However, there is still a lack of effective techniques for detecting various complex code poisoning attacks.
  In this paper, we propose an innovative and lightweight technique for code poisoning detection named KillBadCode. KillBadCode is designed based on our insight that code poisoning disrupts the naturalness of code. Specifically, KillBadCode first builds a code language model (CodeLM) on a lightweight $n$-gram language model. Then, given poisoned data, KillBadCode utilizes CodeLM to identify those tokens in (poisoned) code snippets that will make the code snippets more natural after being deleted as trigger tokens. Considering that the removal of some normal tokens in a single sample might also enhance code naturalness, leading to a high false positive rate (FPR), we aggregate the cumulative improvement of each token across all samples. Finally, KillBadCode purifies the poisoned data by removing all poisoned samples containing the identified trigger tokens. The experimental results on two code poisoning attacks and four code intelligence tasks demonstrate that KillBadCode significantly outperforms four baselines. More importantly, KillBadCode is very efficient, with a minimum time consumption of only 5 minutes, and is 25 times faster than the best baseline on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Canevaro, Julian Schmidt, Mohammad Sajad Marvi, Hang Yu, Georg Martius, Julian Jordan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of machine learning, the assumption that training and test data share the same distribution is often violated in real-world scenarios, requiring effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This paper presents a novel OOD detection method that leverages the unique local neuroplasticity property of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons, KANs exhibit local plasticity, allowing them to preserve learned information while adapting to new tasks. Our method compares the activation patterns of a trained KAN against its untrained counterpart to detect OOD samples. We validate our approach on benchmarks from image and medical domains, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art techniques. These results underscore the potential of KANs in enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems in diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuchen Cao, Sven Apel, Adish Singla, Vera Demberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed to produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using one of the latest LLMs on a popular code generation dataset. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Chen, Sebastian Szyller, Weilin Xu, Nageen Himayat</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular. Their emergent capabilities can be attributed to their massive training datasets. However, these datasets often contain undesirable or inappropriate content, e.g., harmful texts, personal information, and copyrighted material. This has promoted research into machine unlearning that aims to remove information from trained models. In particular, approximate unlearning seeks to achieve information removal by strategically editing the model rather than complete model retraining.
  Recent work has shown that soft token attacks (STA) can successfully extract purportedly unlearned information from LLMs, thereby exposing limitations in current unlearning methodologies. In this work, we reveal that STAs are an inadequate tool for auditing unlearning. Through systematic evaluation on common unlearning benchmarks (Who Is Harry Potter? and TOFU), we demonstrate that such attacks can elicit any information from the LLM, regardless of (1) the deployed unlearning algorithm, and (2) whether the queried content was originally present in the training corpus. Furthermore, we show that STA with just a few soft tokens (1-10) can elicit random strings over 400-characters long. Thus showing that STAs are too powerful, and misrepresent the effectiveness of the unlearning methods.
  Our work highlights the need for better evaluation baselines, and more appropriate auditing tools for assessing the effectiveness of unlearning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Cong Wang, Xingliang Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Web of Things (WoT) enhances interoperability across web-based and ubiquitous computing platforms while complementing existing IoT standards. The multimodal Federated Learning (FL) paradigm has been introduced to enhance WoT by enabling the fusion of multi-source mobile sensing data while preserving privacy. However, a key challenge in mobile sensing systems using multimodal FL is modality incompleteness, where some modalities may be unavailable or only partially captured, potentially degrading the system's performance and reliability. Current multimodal FL frameworks typically train multiple unimodal FL subsystems or apply interpolation techniques on the node side to approximate missing modalities. However, these approaches overlook the shared latent feature space among incomplete modalities across different nodes and fail to discriminate against low-quality nodes. To address this gap, we present FedMobile, a new knowledge contribution-aware multimodal FL framework designed for robust learning despite missing modalities. FedMobile prioritizes local-to-global knowledge transfer, leveraging cross-node multimodal feature information to reconstruct missing features. It also enhances system performance and resilience to modality heterogeneity through rigorous node contribution assessments and knowledge contribution-aware aggregation rules. Empirical evaluations on five widely recognized multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedMobile maintains robust learning even when up to 90% of modality information is missing or when data from two modalities are randomly missing, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Xue, Kristjan Greenewald, Youssef Mroueh, Baharan Mirzasoleiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucination problems, which hinder their reliability in sensitive applications. In the black-box setting, several self-consistency-based techniques have been proposed for hallucination detection. We empirically study these techniques and show that they achieve performance close to that of a supervised (still black-box) oracle, suggesting little room for improvement within this paradigm. To address this limitation, we explore cross-model consistency checking between the target model and an additional verifier LLM. With this extra information, we observe improved oracle performance compared to purely self-consistency-based methods. We then propose a budget-friendly, two-stage detection algorithm that calls the verifier model only for a subset of cases. It dynamically switches between self-consistency and cross-consistency based on an uncertainty interval of the self-consistency classifier. We provide a geometric interpretation of consistency-based hallucination detection methods through the lens of kernel mean embeddings, offering deeper theoretical insights. Extensive experiments show that this approach maintains high detection performance while significantly reducing computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Language Models (LMs) increasingly operate as autonomous agents, accurately forecasting their capabilities becomes crucial for societal preparedness. We evaluate six forecasting methods that predict downstream capabilities of LM agents. We use "one-step" approaches that predict benchmark scores from input metrics like compute or model release date directly or "two-step" approaches that first predict an intermediate metric like the principal component of cross-benchmark performance (PC-1) and human-evaluated competitive Elo ratings. We evaluate our forecasting methods by backtesting them on a dataset of 38 LMs from the OpenLLM 2 leaderboard. We then use the validated two-step approach (Release Date$\to$Elo$\to$Benchmark) to predict LM agent performance for frontier models on three benchmarks: SWE-Bench Verified (software development), Cybench (cybersecurity assessment), and RE-Bench (ML research engineering). Our forecast predicts that by the beginning of 2026, non-specialized LM agents with low capability elicitation will reach a success rate of 54% on SWE-Bench Verified, while state-of-the-art LM agents will reach an 87% success rate. Our approach does not account for recent advances in inference-compute scaling and might thus be too conservative.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with hierarchical instruction schemes, where certain instructions (e.g., system-level directives) are expected to take precedence over others (e.g., user messages). Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of how effectively these hierarchical control mechanisms work. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework based on constraint prioritization to assess how well LLMs enforce instruction hierarchies. Our experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that models struggle with consistent instruction prioritization, even for simple formatting conflicts. We find that the widely-adopted system/user prompt separation fails to establish a reliable instruction hierarchy, and models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraint types regardless of their priority designation. While controlled prompt engineering and model fine-tuning show modest improvements, our results indicate that instruction hierarchy enforcement is not robustly realized, calling for deeper architectural innovations beyond surface-level modifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face significant performance gaps when applied to technical domains requiring precise information extraction from complex documents. Current evaluation methodologies relying on document-level metrics inadequately capture token-resolution retrieval accuracy that is critical for domain-related documents. We propose a framework combining granular evaluation metrics with synthetic data generation to optimize domain-specific RAG performance. First, we introduce token-aware metrics Precision $\Omega$ and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) that quantify context preservation versus information density trade-offs inherent in technical texts. Second, we develop a reasoning model-driven pipeline using instruction-tuned LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1 distilled variants, and Phi-4) to generate context-anchored QA pairs with discontinuous reference spans across three specialized corpora: SEC 10-K filings (finance), biomedical abstracts (PubMed), and APT threat reports (cybersecurity).
  Our empirical analysis reveals critical insights: smaller chunks (less than 10 tokens) improve precision by 31-42% (IoU = 0.071 vs. baseline 0.053) at recall costs (-18%), while domain-specific embedding strategies yield 22% variance in optimal chunk sizing (5-20 tokens). The DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model demonstrates superior concept alignment (+14% mean IoU over alternatives), though no configuration universally dominates. Financial texts favor larger chunks for risk factor coverage (Recall = 0.81 at size = 20), whereas cybersecurity content benefits from atomic segmentation, Precision $\Omega = 0.28$ at size = 5.

<p>Abstract: Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutic applications, yet existing AI-assisted methods often struggle to generate stable peptides with high affinity due to their inability to accurately simulate the dynamic docking process. To address this challenge, we propose NLFlow, a novel multi-manifold approach based on non-linear flow matching. Specifically, we design a polynomial-based conditional vector field to accelerate the convergence of the peptide's position towards the target pocket, effectively capturing the temporal inconsistencies across position, rotation, torsion, and amino acid type manifolds. This enables the model to better align with the true conformational changes observed in biological docking processes. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related information, such as polarity, to enhance the understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NLFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering a fast and efficient solution for peptide design and advancing the peptide-based therapeutic development.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, advancements in generative artificial intelligence have led to the development of sophisticated tools capable of mimicking diverse artistic styles, opening new possibilities for digital creativity and artistic expression. This paper presents a critical assessment of the style replication capabilities of contemporary generative models, evaluating their strengths and limitations across multiple dimensions. We examine how effectively these models reproduce traditional artistic styles while maintaining structural integrity and compositional balance in the generated images.
  The analysis is based on a new large dataset of AI-generated works imitating artistic styles of the past, holding potential for a wide range of applications: the "AI-pastiche" dataset.
  The study is supported by extensive user surveys, collecting diverse opinions on the dataset and investigation both technical and aesthetic challenges, including the ability to generate outputs that are realistic and visually convincing, the versatility of models in handling a wide range of artistic styles, and the extent to which they adhere to the content and stylistic specifications outlined in prompts.
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of generative tools in style replication, offering insights into their technical and artistic limitations, potential advancements in model design and training methodologies, and emerging opportunities for enhancing digital artistry, human-AI collaboration, and the broader creative landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Fan, Guoqiang Ma, Yuanfeng Song, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into task-specific Small Language Models (SLMs) encounters two significant challenges: safeguarding domain-specific knowledge privacy and managing limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose PPC-GPT, a innovative privacy-preserving federated framework specifically designed for compressing LLMs into task-specific SLMs via pruning and Chain-of-Thought (COT) distillation. PPC-GPT works on a server-client federated architecture, where the client sends differentially private (DP) perturbed task-specific data to the server's LLM. The LLM then generates synthetic data along with their corresponding rationales. This synthetic data is subsequently used for both LLM pruning and retraining processes. Additionally, we harness COT knowledge distillation, leveraging the synthetic data to further improve the retraining of structurally-pruned SLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPC-GPT across various text generation tasks. By compressing LLMs into task-specific SLMs, PPC-GPT not only achieves competitive performance but also prioritizes data privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim W. Dornis, Sebastian Stober</p>
<p>Abstract: Training generative AI models requires extensive amounts of data. A common practice is to collect such data through web scraping. Yet, much of what has been and is collected is copyright protected. Its use may be copyright infringement. In the USA, AI developers rely on "fair use" and in Europe, the prevailing view is that the exception for "Text and Data Mining" (TDM) applies. In a recent interdisciplinary tandem-study, we have argued in detail that this is actually not the case because generative AI training fundamentally differs from TDM. In this article, we share our main findings and the implications for both public and corporate research on generative models. We further discuss how the phenomenon of training data memorization leads to copyright issues independently from the "fair use" and TDM exceptions. Finally, we outline how the ISMIR could contribute to the ongoing discussion about fair practices with respect to generative AI that satisfy all stakeholders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zeng, Enmeng Lu, Xin Guan, Cunqing Huangfu, Zizhe Ruan, Ammar Younas</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is profoundly transforming human society and concurrently presenting a series of ethical, legal, and social issues. The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring, assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI governance systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the role of LLM-generated synthetic data in cyberbullying detection. We conduct a series of experiments where we replace some or all of the authentic data with synthetic data, or augment the authentic data with synthetic data. We find that synthetic cyberbullying data can be the basis for training a classifier for harm detection that reaches performance close to that of a classifier trained with authentic data. Combining authentic with synthetic data shows improvements over the baseline of training on authentic data alone for the test data for all three LLMs tried. These results highlight the viability of synthetic data as a scalable, ethically viable alternative in cyberbullying detection while emphasizing the critical impact of LLM selection on performance outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Chen, Jiaao Chen, Jianda Chen, Misha Sra</p>
<p>Abstract: Current financial LLM agent benchmarks are inadequate. They prioritize task performance while ignoring fundamental safety risks. Threats like hallucinations, temporal misalignment, and adversarial vulnerabilities pose systemic risks in high-stakes financial environments, yet existing evaluation frameworks fail to capture these risks. We take a firm position: traditional benchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance. To address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding safety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an empirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal hidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To move the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA), grounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the model level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process reliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight the urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the focus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas \"Ubellacker</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates how individuals' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) limitations influence organizational readiness for AI adoption. Through semi-structured interviews with seven AI implementation experts, analyzed using the Gioia methodology, the research reveals that organizational readiness emerges through dynamic interactions between individual sensemaking, social learning, and formal integration processes. The findings demonstrate that hands-on experience with AI limitations leads to more realistic expectations and increased trust, mainly when supported by peer networks and champion systems. Organizations that successfully translate these individual and collective insights into formal governance structures achieve more sustainable AI adoption. The study advances theory by showing how organizational readiness for AI adoption evolves through continuous cycles of individual understanding, social learning, and organizational adaptation. These insights suggest that organizations should approach AI adoption not as a one-time implementation but as an ongoing strategic learning process that balances innovation with practical constraints. The research contributes to organizational readiness theory and practice by illuminating how micro-level perceptions and experiences shape macro-level adoption outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manar Aljohani, Jun Hou, Sindhura Kommu, Xuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making, medical research, and patient care. As LLMs are increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, several critical challenges must be addressed to ensure their reliable and ethical deployment. These challenges include truthfulness, where models generate misleading information; privacy, with risks of unintentional data retention; robustness, requiring defenses against adversarial attacks; fairness, addressing biases in clinical outcomes; explainability, ensuring transparent decision-making; and safety, mitigating risks of misinformation and medical errors. Recently, researchers have begun developing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to systematically assess the trustworthiness of LLMs. However, the trustworthiness of LLMs in healthcare remains underexplored, lacking a systematic review that provides a comprehensive understanding and future insights into this area. This survey bridges this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the recent research of existing methodologies and solutions aimed at mitigating the above risks in healthcare. By focusing on key trustworthiness dimensions including truthfulness, privacy and safety, robustness, fairness and bias, and explainability, we present a thorough analysis of how these issues impact the reliability and ethical use of LLMs in healthcare. This paper highlights ongoing efforts and offers insights into future research directions to ensure the safe and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaid Khan, Ali Farhadi, Ranjay Krishna, Luca Weihs, Mohit Bansal, Tanmay Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: When a human requests an LLM to complete a coding task using functionality from a large code repository, how do we provide context from the repo to the LLM? One approach is to add the entire repo to the LLM's context window. However, most tasks involve only fraction of symbols from a repo, longer contexts are detrimental to the LLM's reasoning abilities, and context windows are not unlimited. Alternatively, we could emulate the human ability to navigate a large repo, pick out the right functionality, and form a plan to solve the task. We propose MutaGReP (Mutation-guided Grounded Repository Plan Search), an approach to search for plans that decompose a user request into natural language steps grounded in the codebase. MutaGReP performs neural tree search in plan space, exploring by mutating plans and using a symbol retriever for grounding. On the challenging LongCodeArena benchmark, our plans use less than 5% of the 128K context window for GPT-4o but rival the coding performance of GPT-4o with a context window filled with the repo. Plans produced by MutaGReP allow Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B and 72B to match the performance of GPT-4o with full repo context and enable progress on the hardest LongCodeArena tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Junjiao Tian, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dorsa Farahmandazad, Kasra Danesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Medicare fraud poses a substantial challenge to healthcare systems, resulting in significant financial losses and undermining the quality of care provided to legitimate beneficiaries. This study investigates the use of machine learning (ML) to enhance Medicare fraud detection, addressing key challenges such as class imbalance, high-dimensional data, and evolving fraud patterns. A dataset comprising inpatient claims, outpatient claims, and beneficiary details was used to train and evaluate five ML models: Random Forest, KNN, LDA, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost. Data preprocessing techniques included resampling SMOTE method to address the class imbalance, feature selection for dimensionality reduction, and aggregation of diagnostic and procedural codes. Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a training accuracy of 99.2% and validation accuracy of 98.8%, and F1-score (98.4%). The Decision Tree also performed well, achieving a validation accuracy of 96.3%. KNN and AdaBoost demonstrated moderate performance, with validation accuracies of 79.2% and 81.1%, respectively, while LDA struggled with a validation accuracy of 63.3% and a low recall of 16.6%. The results highlight the importance of advanced resampling techniques, feature engineering, and adaptive learning in detecting Medicare fraud effectively. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in addressing the complexities of fraud detection. Future work should explore explainable AI and hybrid models to improve interpretability and performance, ensuring scalable and reliable fraud detection systems that protect healthcare resources and beneficiaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Yushi Feng, Changyang He, Yue Deng, Hongxi Pu, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide explainable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and a Distinguisher that examines how well the input texts align with the predicted prompts. We develop and examine two versions of Distinguishers. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that both Distinguishers perform significantly better than the baseline methods, with version2 outperforming baselines by 9.73% on in-distribution data (F1-score) and 12.65% on OOD data (AUROC). Furthermore, a user study is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing impact of human-induced climate change and unplanned urban constructions has increased flooding incidents in recent years. Accurate identification of flooded areas is crucial for effective disaster management and urban planning. While few works have utilized convolutional neural networks and transformer-based semantic segmentation techniques for identifying flooded areas from aerial footage, recent developments in graph neural networks have created improvement opportunities. This paper proposes an innovative approach, the Graph Attention Convolutional U-NET (GAC-UNET) model, based on graph neural networks for automated identification of flooded areas. The model incorporates a graph attention mechanism and Chebyshev layers into the U-Net architecture. Furthermore, this paper explores the applicability of transfer learning and model reprogramming to enhance the accuracy of flood area segmentation models. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GAC-UNET model, outperforms other approaches with 91\% mAP, 94\% dice score, and 89\% IoU, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and better planning of future infrastructures in flood-prone areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Zhuang, Xiaodong Yu, Jialian Wu, Ximeng Sun, Ze Wang, Jiang Liu, Yusheng Su, Jingbo Shang, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and context retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Baena, Paolo Testolina, Michele Polese, Dimitrios Koutsonikolas, Josep Jornet, Tommaso Melodia</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are essential for ubiquitous connectivity, providing coverage in remote and underserved areas. However, since NTNs are currently operated independently, they face challenges such as isolation, limited scalability, and high operational costs. Integrating satellite constellations with terrestrial networks offers a way to address these limitations while enabling adaptive and cost-efficient connectivity through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.
  This paper introduces Space-O-RAN, a framework that extends Open Radio Access Network (RAN) principles to NTNs. It employs hierarchical closed-loop control with distributed Space RAN Intelligent Controllers (Space-RICs) to dynamically manage and optimize operations across both domains.
  To enable adaptive resource allocation and network orchestration, the proposed architecture integrates real-time satellite optimization and control with AI-driven management and digital twin (DT) modeling. It incorporates distributed Space Applications (sApps) and dApps to ensure robust performance in in highly dynamic orbital environments. A core feature is dynamic link-interface mapping, which allows network functions to adapt to specific application requirements and changing link conditions using all physical links on the satellite.
  Simulation results evaluate its feasibility by analyzing latency constraints across different NTN link types, demonstrating that intra-cluster coordination operates within viable signaling delay bounds, while offloading non-real-time tasks to ground infrastructure enhances scalability toward sixth-generation (6G) networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given a swarm of limited-capability robots, we seek to automatically discover the set of possible emergent behaviors. Prior approaches to behavior discovery rely on human feedback or hand-crafted behavior metrics to represent and evolve behaviors and only discover behaviors in simulation, without testing or considering the deployment of these new behaviors on real robot swarms. In this work, we present Real2Sim2Real Behavior Discovery via Self-Supervised Representation Learning, which combines representation learning and novelty search to discover possible emergent behaviors automatically in simulation and enable direct controller transfer to real robots. First, we evaluate our method in simulation and show that our proposed self-supervised representation learning approach outperforms previous hand-crafted metrics by more accurately representing the space of possible emergent behaviors. Then, we address the reality gap by incorporating recent work in sim2real transfer for swarms into our lightweight simulator design, enabling direct robot deployment of all behaviors discovered in simulation on an open-source and low-cost robot platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shane Bergsma, Nolan Dey, Gurpreet Gosal, Gavia Gray, Daria Soboleva, Joel Hestness</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are commonly trained with a learning rate (LR) warmup, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the maximum (10x decay). In a large-scale empirical study, we show that under an optimal peak LR, a simple linear decay-to-zero (D2Z) schedule consistently outperforms other schedules when training at compute-optimal dataset sizes. D2Z is superior across a range of model sizes, batch sizes, datasets, and vocabularies. Benefits increase as dataset size increases. Leveraging a novel interpretation of AdamW as an exponential moving average of weight updates, we show how linear D2Z optimally balances the demands of early training (moving away from initial conditions) and late training (averaging over more updates in order to mitigate gradient noise). In experiments, a 610M-parameter model trained for 80 tokens-per-parameter (TPP) using D2Z achieves lower loss than when trained for 200 TPP using 10x decay, corresponding to an astonishing 60% compute savings. Models such as Llama2-7B, trained for 286 TPP with 10x decay, could likely have saved a majority of compute by training with D2Z.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifu Zhan, Jun Wang, Shuang Zhou, Jiawen Deng, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To optimize in-context learning in biomedical natural language processing by improving example selection. Methods: We introduce a novel multi-mode retrieval-augmented generation (MMRAG) framework, which integrates four retrieval strategies: (1) Random Mode, selecting examples arbitrarily; (2) Top Mode, retrieving the most relevant examples based on similarity; (3) Diversity Mode, ensuring variation in selected examples; and (4) Class Mode, selecting category-representative examples. This study evaluates MMRAG on three core biomedical NLP tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Text Classification (TC). The datasets used include BC2GM for gene and protein mention recognition (NER), DDI for drug-drug interaction extraction (RE), GIT for general biomedical information extraction (RE), and HealthAdvice for health-related text classification (TC). The framework is tested with two large language models (Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B) and three retrievers (Contriever, MedCPT, BGE-Large) to assess performance across different retrieval strategies. Results: The results from the Random mode indicate that providing more examples in the prompt improves the model's generation performance. Meanwhile, Top mode and Diversity mode significantly outperform Random mode on the RE (DDI) task, achieving an F1 score of 0.9669, a 26.4% improvement. Among the three retrievers tested, Contriever outperformed the other two in a greater number of experiments. Additionally, Llama 2 and Llama 3 demonstrated varying capabilities across different tasks, with Llama 3 showing a clear advantage in handling NER tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Themistoklis Haris, Krzysztof Onak</p>
<p>Abstract: A key limitation of autoregressive Transformers is the large memory needed at inference-time to cache all previous key-value (KV) embeddings. Prior works address this by compressing the KV cache, but often assume specific structural properties of the embeddings. This raises the following natural question: Can truly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for attention-based token generation must use $\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated so far and $d = \Omega(\log n)$ is the dimension of the KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication complexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties of projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the low-dimensional regime $d = o(\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires $\Omega(d\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers, that SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this bound. Further, we investigate how sparsity assumptions enable token generation in truly sublinear space, presenting impossibility results and proposing a new KV cache compression algorithm for sliding window attention when the value cache outside the window is unmasked. Finally, we analyze token generation's time complexity, using an indistinguishability argument to prove that no non-adaptive algorithm can compute attention online in sublinear time for all tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqiang Wang, Suyuchen Wang, Yun Zhu, Bang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory plays a key role in enhancing LLMs' performance when deployed to real-world applications. Existing solutions face trade-offs: explicit memory designs based on external storage require complex management and incur storage overhead, while implicit memory designs that store information via parameters struggle with reliable retrieval. In this paper, we propose R$^3$Mem, a memory network that optimizes both information Retention and Retrieval through Reversible context compression. Specifically, R$^3$Mem employs virtual memory tokens to compress and encode infinitely long histories, further enhanced by a hierarchical compression strategy that refines information from document- to entity-level for improved assimilation across granularities. For retrieval, R$^3$Mem employs a reversible architecture, reconstructing raw data by invoking the model backward with compressed information. Implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it can integrate seamlessly with any Transformer-based model. Experiments demonstrate that our memory design achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-context language modeling and retrieval-augmented generation tasks. It also significantly outperforms conventional memory modules in long-horizon interaction tasks like conversational agents, showcasing its potential for next-generation retrieval systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avanika Narayan, Dan Biderman, Sabri Eyuboglu, Avner May, Scott Linderman, James Zou, Christopher Re</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate an emerging setup in which a small, on-device language model (LM) with access to local data communicates with a frontier, cloud-hosted LM to solve real-world tasks involving financial, medical, and scientific reasoning over long documents. Can a local-remote collaboration reduce cloud inference costs while preserving quality? First, we consider a naive collaboration protocol where the local and remote models simply chat back and forth. Because only the local model reads the full context, this protocol achieves a 30.4x reduction in remote costs, but recovers only 87% of the performance of the frontier model. We identify two key limitations of this protocol: the local model struggles to (1) follow the remote model's multi-step instructions and (2) reason over long contexts. Motivated by these observations, we study an extension of this protocol, coined MinionS, in which the remote model decomposes the task into easier subtasks over shorter chunks of the document, that are executed locally in parallel. MinionS reduces costs by 5.7x on average while recovering 97.9% of the performance of the remote model alone. Our analysis reveals several key design choices that influence the trade-off between cost and performance in local-remote systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Rudman, Michal Golovanesky, Amir Bar, Vedant Palit, Yann LeCun, Carsten Eickhoff, Ritambhara Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across various multimodal tasks. However, their effectiveness in cross-cultural contexts remains limited due to the predominantly Western-centric nature of existing data and models. Meanwhile, multi-agent models have shown strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in a multi-agent interaction setting for the novel task of multicultural image generation. Our key contributions are: (1) We introduce MosAIG, a Multi-Agent framework that enhances multicultural Image Generation by leveraging LLMs with distinct cultural personas; (2) We provide a dataset of 9,000 multicultural images spanning five countries, three age groups, two genders, 25 historical landmarks, and five languages; and (3) We demonstrate that multi-agent interactions outperform simple, no-agent models across multiple evaluation metrics, offering valuable insights for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesus Rios, Pierre Dognin, Ronny Luss, Karthikeyan N. Ramamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Full fine-tuning of large language models for alignment and task adaptation has become prohibitively expensive as models have grown in size. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim at significantly reducing the computational and memory resources needed for fine-tuning these models by only training on a small number of parameters instead of all model parameters. Currently, the most popular PEFT method is the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which freezes the parameters of the model to be fine-tuned and introduces a small set of trainable parameters in the form of low-rank matrices. We propose simply reducing the number of trainable parameters by randomly selecting a small proportion of the model parameters to train on. In this paper, we compare the efficiency and performance of our proposed approach with PEFT methods, including LoRA, as well as full parameter fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tian, Daniel Lee, Fei Wu, Tung Mai, Kun Qian, Siddhartha Sahai, Tianyi Zhang, Yunyao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL models, which parse natural language (NL) questions to executable SQL queries, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However, deploying such models in the real world often requires adapting them to the highly specialized database schemas used in specific applications. We find that existing text-to-SQL models experience significant performance drops when applied to new schemas, primarily due to the lack of domain-specific data for fine-tuning. This data scarcity also limits the ability to effectively evaluate model performance in new domains. Continuously obtaining high-quality text-to-SQL data for evolving schemas is prohibitively expensive in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose SQLsynth, a human-in-the-loop text-to-SQL data annotation system. SQLsynth streamlines the creation of high-quality text-to-SQL datasets through human-LLM collaboration in a structured workflow. A within-subjects user study comparing SQLsynth with manual annotation and ChatGPT shows that SQLsynth significantly accelerates text-to-SQL data annotation, reduces cognitive load, and produces datasets that are more accurate, natural, and diverse.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayant Sachdev, Sean D Rosario, Abhijeet Phatak, He Wen, Swati Kirti, Chittaranjan Tripathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate query-product relevance labeling is indispensable to generate ground truth dataset for search ranking in e-commerce. Traditional approaches for annotating query-product pairs rely on human-based labeling services, which is expensive, time-consuming and prone to errors. In this work, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate query-product relevance labeling for large-scale e-commerce search. We use several publicly available and proprietary LLMs for this task, and conducted experiments on two open-source datasets and an in-house e-commerce search dataset. Using prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, In-context Learning (ICL), and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR), we show that LLM's performance has the potential to approach human-level accuracy on this task in a fraction of the time and cost required by human-labelers, thereby suggesting that our approach is more efficient than the conventional methods. We have generated query-product relevance labels using LLMs at scale, and are using them for evaluating improvements to our search algorithms. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve query-product relevance thus enhancing e-commerce search user experience. More importantly, this scalable alternative to human-annotation has significant implications for information retrieval domains including search and recommendation systems, where relevance scoring is crucial for optimizing the ranking of products and content to improve customer engagement and other conversion metrics.</p>

Our model tuning strategy for med-gte-hybrid combines contrastive learning and a denoising autoencoder. To evaluate the performance of med-gte-hybrid, we investigate several clinical prediction tasks in large patient cohorts extracted from the MIMIC-IV dataset, including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patient prognosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) prediction, and patient mortality prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the med-gte-hybrid model improves patient stratification, clustering, and text retrieval, thus outperforms current state-of-the-art models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While some of our evaluations focus on CKD, our hybrid tuning of sentence transformers could be transferred to other medical domains and has the potential to improve clinical decision-making and personalised treatment pathways in various healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Shekhar, Bidur Devkota, Dumindu Samaraweera, Laxima Niure Kandel, Manoj Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models, particularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous driving. Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in real-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following this idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic for autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a 'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this attack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized on a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a comprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches trained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the Segformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of our analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study reveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs. Transformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude that although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images of any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular model are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true for both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that for CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike ViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less misclassification than others.

<p>Abstract: Technological advancements in soccer have surged over the past decade, transforming aspects of the sport. Unlike binary rules, many soccer regulations, such as the "Offside Rule," rely on subjective interpretation rather than straightforward True or False criteria. The on-field referee holds ultimate authority in adjudicating these nuanced decisions. A significant breakthrough in soccer officiating is the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system, leveraging a network of 20-30 cameras within stadiums to minimize human errors. VAR's operational scope typically encompasses 10-30 cameras, ensuring high decision accuracy but at a substantial cost. This report proposes an innovative approach to offside detection using a single camera, such as the broadcasting camera, to mitigate expenses associated with sophisticated technological setups.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potent diagnostic tool for detecting pathological tissues in various diseases. Different MRI sequences have different contrast mechanisms and sensitivities for different types of lesions, which pose challenges to accurate and consistent lesion segmentation. In clinical practice, radiologists commonly use the sub-sequence feature, i.e. the difference between post contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (post) and pre-contrast-enhanced (pre) sequences, to locate lesions. Inspired by this, we propose a residual fusion method to learn subsequence representation for MRI lesion segmentation. Specifically, we iteratively and adaptively fuse features from pre- and post-contrast sequences at multiple resolutions, using dynamic weights to achieve optimal fusion and address diverse lesion enhancement patterns. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation and our in-house breast MRI dataset for breast lesion segmentation. Our method is clinically inspired and has the potential to facilitate lesion segmentation in various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Aref, Sheng Wei, Narayan B. Mandayam</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the complexity of multi-tenant cloud environments and the need for real-time threat mitigation, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) must integrate AI-driven adaptive defenses against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). However, SOC analysts struggle with countering adaptive adversarial tactics, necessitating intelligent decision-support frameworks. To enhance human-AI collaboration in SOCs, we propose a Cognitive Hierarchy Theory-driven Deep Q-Network (CHT-DQN) framework that models SOC analysts' decision-making against AI-driven APT bots. The SOC analyst (defender) operates at cognitive level-1, anticipating attacker strategies, while the APT bot (attacker) follows a level-0 exploitative policy. By incorporating CHT into DQN, our framework enhances SOC defense strategies via Attack Graph (AG)-based reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments across varying AG complexities show that CHT-DQN achieves higher data protection and lower action discrepancies compared to standard DQN. A theoretical lower bound analysis further validates its superior Q-value performance. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) reveals that SOC analysts using CHT-DQN-driven transition probabilities align better with adaptive attackers, improving data protection. Additionally, human decision patterns exhibit risk aversion after failure and risk-seeking behavior after success, aligning with Prospect Theory. These findings underscore the potential of integrating cognitive modeling into deep reinforcement learning to enhance SOC operations and develop real-time adaptive cloud security mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework tailored for EEG analysis that transforms continuous, noisy brain signals into a sequence of discrete, well-represented tokens for various EEG tasks. Conventional approaches typically rely on continuous embeddings and inter-channel dependencies, which are limited in capturing inherent EEG features such as temporally unpredictable patterns and diverse oscillatory waveforms. In contrast, we hypothesize that critical time-frequency features can be effectively captured from a single channel. By learning tokens that encapsulate these intrinsic patterns within a single channel, our approach yields a scalable tokenizer adaptable across diverse EEG settings. We integrate the TFM-Tokenizer with a transformer-based TFM-Encoder, leveraging established pretraining techniques from natural language processing, such as masked token prediction, followed by downstream fine-tuning for various EEG tasks. Experiments across four EEG datasets show that TFM-Token outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On TUEV, our approach improves balanced accuracy and Cohen's Kappa by 5% over baselines. Comprehensive analysis of the learned tokens demonstrates their ability to capture class-distinctive features, enhance frequency representation, and ability to encode time-frequency motifs into distinct tokens, improving interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) threaten modern machine learning systems by enabling adversaries to steal models, exposing intellectual property and training data. With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in distributed computing environments, including cloud, edge, and federated learning settings, each paradigm introduces distinct vulnerabilities and challenges. Without a unified perspective on MEAs across these distributed environments, organizations risk fragmented defenses, inadequate risk assessments, and substantial economic and privacy losses. This survey is motivated by the urgent need to understand how the unique characteristics of cloud, edge, and federated deployments shape attack vectors and defense requirements. We systematically examine the evolution of attack methodologies and defense mechanisms across these environments, demonstrating how environmental factors influence security strategies in critical sectors such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and financial services. By synthesizing recent advances in MEAs research and discussing the limitations of current evaluation practices, this survey provides essential insights for developing robust and adaptive defense strategies. Our comprehensive approach highlights the importance of integrating protective measures across the entire distributed computing landscape to ensure the secure deployment of machine learning models.</p>

We introduce MRTAgent, a dual-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework inspired by self-play, designed to optimize task assignments and robot selection to ensure timely task execution. For safe navigation, a modified linear quadratic controller (LQR) approach is employed. To the best of our knowledge, MRTAgent is the first framework to address all critical aspects of practical MRTA problems while supporting continuous robot movements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable performance in domains such as mathematics, programming, and literary creation. However, most studies have focused on semantic memory-based question answering, neglecting LLMs' potential to handle episodic memory (EM)-related queries. This oversight has led to suboptimal performance in applications requiring EM, including emotional companionship, personal AI assistants, and AI teachers. To address this gap, we introduce Echo, a LLM enhanced with temporal episodic memory. We propose a Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework that guides the model in generating multi-turn, complex scenario episodic memory dialogue data (EM-Train). Temporal information is innovatively incorporated into the LLM training process, and Echo is trained using the EM-Train. Furthermore, We develop an EM-Test benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' episodic memory capabilities. The EM-Test assesses performance across various time spans and difficulty levels, providing a comprehensive evaluation of multi-turn episodic memory dialogues. Our experiments demonstrate that Echo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on EM-Test. Additionally, a qualitative analysis reveals Echo's potential to exhibit human-like episodic memory capabilities. We will open-source all datasets, code, and model weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Cheng, Xiaoyu Xia, Hong Wang, Minghui Liwang, Ning Chen, Xuwei Fan, Xianbin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge inference (EI) is a key solution to address the growing challenges of delayed response times, limited scalability, and privacy concerns in cloud-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference. However, deploying DNN models on resource-constrained edge devices faces more severe challenges, such as model storage limitations, dynamic service requests, and privacy risks. This paper proposes a novel framework for privacy-aware joint DNN model deployment and partition optimization to minimize long-term average inference delay under resource and privacy constraints. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a complex optimization problem considering model deployment, user-server association, and model partition strategies. To handle the NP-hardness and future uncertainties, a Lyapunov-based approach is introduced to transform the long-term optimization into a single-time-slot problem, ensuring system performance. Additionally, a coalition formation game model is proposed for edge server association, and a greedy-based algorithm is developed for model deployment within each coalition to efficiently solve the problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxiang Fan, Changshuang Zhou, Hao Yu, Xueyang Wu, Jiangyu Gu, Zhenhui Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching literature under interdisciplinary contexts (e.g., science, art) that connect reading materials has become popular in elementary schools. However, constructing such contexts is challenging as it requires teachers to explore substantial amounts of interdisciplinary content and link it to the reading materials. In this paper, we develop LitLinker via an iterative design process involving 13 teachers to facilitate the ideation of interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature. Powered by a large language model (LLM), LitLinker can recommend interdisciplinary topics and contextualize them with the literary elements (e.g., paragraphs, viewpoints) in the reading materials. A within-subjects study (N=16) shows that compared to an LLM chatbot, LitLinker can improve the integration depth of different subjects and reduce workload in this ideation task. Expert interviews (N=9) also demonstrate LitLinker's usefulness for supporting the ideation of interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature. We conclude with concerns and design considerations for supporting interdisciplinary teaching with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tue M. Cao, Nhat X. Hoang, Hieu H. Pham, Phi Le Nguyen, My T. Thai</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of neural networks is essential for enhancing model performance and interpretability. Current research predominantly focuses on examining the connection between individual neurons and the model's final predictions. Which suffers from challenges in interpreting the internal workings of the model, particularly when neurons encode multiple unrelated features. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that transitions the focus from analyzing individual neurons to investigating groups of neurons, shifting the emphasis from neuron-output relationships to functional interaction between neurons. Our automated framework, NeurFlow, first identifies core neurons and clusters them into groups based on shared functional relationships, enabling a more coherent and interpretable view of the network's internal processes. This approach facilitates the construction of a hierarchical circuit representing neuron interactions across layers, thus improving interpretability while reducing computational costs. Our extensive empirical studies validate the fidelity of our proposed NeurFlow. Additionally, we showcase its utility in practical applications such as image debugging and automatic concept labeling, thereby highlighting its potential to advance the field of neural network explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmahdi Mirfakhar, Xuchuang Wang, Jinhang Zuo, Yair Zick, Mohammad Hajiesmaili</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a hinted heterogeneous multi-agent multi-armed bandits problem (HMA2B), where agents can query low-cost observations (hints) in addition to pulling arms. In this framework, each of the $M$ agents has a unique reward distribution over $K$ arms, and in $T$ rounds, they can observe the reward of the arm they pull only if no other agent pulls that arm. The goal is to maximize the total utility by querying the minimal necessary hints without pulling arms, achieving time-independent regret. We study HMA2B in both centralized and decentralized setups. Our main centralized algorithm, GP-HCLA, which is an extension of HCLA, uses a central decision-maker for arm-pulling and hint queries, achieving $O(M^4K)$ regret with $O(MK\log T)$ adaptive hints. In decentralized setups, we propose two algorithms, HD-ETC and EBHD-ETC, that allow agents to choose actions independently through collision-based communication and query hints uniformly until stopping, yielding $O(M^3K^2)$ regret with $O(M^3K\log T)$ hints, where the former requires knowledge of the minimum gap and the latter does not. Finally, we establish lower bounds to prove the optimality of our results and verify them through numerical simulations.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16129">Robust Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Liu, Hanyang Wang, Siyuan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is a nascent field of research that involves the automated recognition of facial expressions in video data. Although existing research has primarily focused on learning representations under noisy and hard samples, the issue of the coexistence of both types of samples remains unresolved. In order to overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a robust method of distinguishing between hard and noisy samples. This is achieved by evaluating the prediction agreement of the model on different sampled clips of the video. Subsequently, methodologies that reinforce the learning of hard samples and mitigate the impact of noisy samples can be employed. Moreover, to identify the principal expression in a video and enhance the model's capacity for representation learning, comprising a key expression re-sampling framework and a dual-stream hierarchical network is proposed, namely Robust Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (RDFER). The key expression re-sampling framework is designed to identify the key expression, thereby mitigating the potential confusion caused by non-target expressions. RDFER employs two sequence models with the objective of disentangling short-term facial movements and long-term emotional changes. The proposed method has been shown to outperform current State-Of-The-Art approaches in DFER through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets such as DFEW and FERV39K. A comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights and observations regarding the proposed agreement. This work has significant implications for the field of dynamic facial expression recognition and promotes the further development of the field of noise-consistent robust learning in dynamic facial expression recognition.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel strategy defined as Chain-of-Description (CoD) Prompting, tailored for Multi-Modal Large Language Models. This approach involves having the model first provide a detailed description of the multi-modal input before generating an answer to the question. When applied to models such as Qwen2-Audio, Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-VL, CoD Prompting significantly enhances performance compared to standard prompting methods. This is demonstrated by nearly a 4\% improvement in the speech category of the audio benchmark AIR-Bench-Chat and a 5.3\% improvement in the hard-level portion of the vision benchmark MMMU\_Pro. Our ablation study further validates the effectiveness of CoD Prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Liu, Xiaojun Jia, Yuan Xun, Hua Zhang, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized data generation, particularly in text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, the widespread use of personalized generative models raises significant concerns regarding privacy violations and copyright infringement. To address these issues, researchers have proposed adversarial perturbation-based protection techniques. However, these methods have notable limitations, including insufficient robustness against data transformations and the inability to fully eliminate identifiable features of protected objects in the generated output. In this paper, we introduce PersGuard, a novel backdoor-based approach that prevents malicious personalization of specific images. Unlike traditional adversarial perturbation methods, PersGuard implant backdoor triggers into pre-trained T2I models, preventing the generation of customized outputs for designated protected images while allowing normal personalization for unprotected ones. Unfortunately, existing backdoor methods for T2I diffusion models fail to be applied to personalization scenarios due to the different backdoor objectives and the potential backdoor elimination during downstream fine-tuning processes. To address these, we propose three novel backdoor objectives specifically designed for personalization scenarios, coupled with backdoor retention loss engineered to resist downstream fine-tuning. These components are integrated into a unified optimization framework. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate PersGuard's effectiveness in preserving data privacy, even under challenging conditions including gray-box settings, multi-object protection, and facial identity scenarios. Our method significantly outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust solution for privacy and copyright protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Li, Fei Liu, Zhengkun Wang, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have shown promise in solving routing problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) without handcrafted designs. Research in this domain has explored two primary categories of methods: iterative and non-iterative. While non-iterative methods struggle to generate near-optimal solutions directly, iterative methods simplify the task by learning local search steps. However, existing iterative methods are often limited by restricted neighborhood searches, leading to suboptimal results. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that extends the search to larger neighborhoods by learning a destroy-and-repair strategy. Specifically, we introduce a Destroy-and-Repair framework based on Hyper-Graphs (DRHG). This framework reduces consecutive intact edges to hyper-edges, allowing the model to pay more attention to the destroyed part and decrease the complexity of encoding all nodes. Experiments demonstrate that DRHG achieves stateof-the-art performance on TSP with up to 10,000 nodes and shows strong generalization to real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Long, Liansheng Zhuang, Aodi Li, Minghong Yao, Shafei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the remarkable reasoning ability, Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) tasks, which find answers to natural language questions over knowledge graphs (KGs). To alleviate the hallucinations and lack of knowledge issues of LLMs, existing methods often retrieve the question-related information from KGs to enrich the input context. However, most methods focus on retrieving the relevant information while ignoring the importance of different types of knowledge in reasoning, which degrades their performance. To this end, this paper reformulates the KGQA problem as a graphical model and proposes a three-stage framework named the Evidence Path Enhanced Reasoning Model (EPERM) for KGQA. In the first stage, EPERM uses the fine-tuned LLM to retrieve a subgraph related to the question from the original knowledge graph. In the second stage, EPERM filters out the evidence paths that faithfully support the reasoning of the questions, and score their importance in reasoning. Finally, EPERM uses the weighted evidence paths to reason the final answer. Since considering the importance of different structural information in KGs for reasoning, EPERM can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs in KGQA tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that EPERM achieves superior performances in KGQA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej Chrab\k{a}szcz, Filip Szatkowski, Bartosz W\'ojcik, Jan Dubi\'nski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of the Large Language Model (LLM) is critical, but currently used methods in most cases sacrifice the model performance to obtain increased safety or perform poorly on data outside of their adaptation distribution. We investigate existing methods for such generalization and find them insufficient. Surprisingly, while even plain LLMs recognize unsafe prompts, they may still generate unsafe responses. To avoid performance degradation and preserve safe performance, we advocate for a two-step framework, where we first identify unsafe prompts via a lightweight classifier, and apply a "safe" model only to such prompts. In particular, we explore the design of the safety detector in more detail, investigating the use of different classifier architectures and prompting techniques. Interestingly, we find that the final hidden state for the last token is enough to provide robust performance, minimizing false positives on benign data while performing well on malicious prompt detection. Additionally, we show that classifiers trained on the representations from different model layers perform comparably on the latest model layers, indicating that safety representation is present in the LLMs' hidden states at most model stages. Our work is a step towards efficient, representation-based safety mechanisms for LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human bodily movements convey critical insights into action intentions and cognitive processes, yet existing multimodal systems primarily focused on understanding human motion via language, vision, and audio, which struggle to capture the dynamic forces and torques inherent in 3D motion. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) present a promising alternative, offering lightweight, wearable, and privacy-conscious motion sensing. However, processing of streaming IMU data faces challenges such as wireless transmission instability, sensor noise, and drift, limiting their utility for long-term real-time motion capture (MoCap), and more importantly, online motion analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce Mojito, an intelligent motion agent that integrates inertial sensing with large language models (LLMs) for interactive motion capture and behavioral analysis.</p>

We show that Homomorphic Neural Networks (HNN) can achieve full privacy and security while maintaining levels of accuracy comparable to plain neural networks. We also introduce a new layer, the Differentiable Soft-Argmax, which allows the calibration of output logits in the encrypted domain, raising the entropy of the activation parameters, thus improving the security of the model, while keeping the overall noise below the acceptable noise budget. Experiments were conducted using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) corpora on the DistilBERT base uncased finetuned SST-2 English sentiment analysis model, and the results show that the HNN model can achieve up to 82.5% of the accuracy of the plain model while maintaining full privacy and security.</p>

<p>Abstract: Complex claim fact-checking performs a crucial role in disinformation detection. However, existing fact-checking methods struggle with claim vagueness, specifically in effectively handling latent information and complex relations within claims. Moreover, evidence redundancy, where nonessential information complicates the verification process, remains a significant issue. To tackle these limitations, we propose Bilateral Defusing Verification (BiDeV), a novel fact-checking working-flow framework integrating multiple role-played LLMs to mimic the human-expert fact-checking process. BiDeV consists of two main modules: Vagueness Defusing identifies latent information and resolves complex relations to simplify the claim, and Redundancy Defusing eliminates redundant content to enhance the evidence quality. Extensive experimental results on two widely used challenging fact-checking benchmarks (Hover and Feverous-s) demonstrate that our BiDeV can achieve the best performance under both gold and open settings. This highlights the effectiveness of BiDeV in handling complex claims and ensuring precise fact-checking</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masoud Shokrnezhad, Tarik Taleb</p>
<p>Abstract: 6G networks aim to achieve global coverage, massive connectivity, and ultra-stringent requirements. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) and Semantic Communication (SemCom) are essential for realizing these goals, yet they introduce considerable complexity in resource orchestration. Drawing inspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this complexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use of LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing solutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their adaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a framework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a SemCom-enabled SAGIN. This framework employs an LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) monitors services, users, and resources and processes the collected data, while a Hierarchical Action Planner (HAP) orchestrates resources. ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for high-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level decision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The LLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered by contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management for continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC, along with a comprehensive discussion on potential future research directions to enhance and upgrade ARC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Zhao, Wentao Mu, Xian Zhou, Wenbo Liu, Fei Yan, Tao Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Driver attention recognition in driving scenarios is a popular direction in traffic scene perception technology. It aims to understand human driver attention to focus on specific targets/objects in the driving scene. However, traffic scenes contain not only a large amount of visual information but also semantic information related to driving tasks. Existing methods lack attention to the actual semantic information present in driving scenes. Additionally, the traffic scene is a complex and dynamic process that requires constant attention to objects related to the current driving task. Existing models, influenced by their foundational frameworks, tend to have large parameter counts and complex structures. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time saliency Mamba network based on the latest Mamba framework. As shown in Figure 1, our model uses very few parameters (0.08M, only 0.09~11.16% of other models), while maintaining SOTA performance or achieving over 98% of the SOTA model's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asiri Wijesinghe, Hao Zhu, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSSL) struggles to capture complex structural properties well. This limitation stems from two main factors: (1) the inadequacy of conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in representing sophisticated topological features, and (2) the focus of self-supervised learning solely on final graph representations. To address these issues, we introduce \emph{GenHopNet}, a GNN framework that integrates a $k$-hop message-passing scheme, enhancing its ability to capture local structural information without explicit substructure extraction. We theoretically demonstrate that \emph{GenHopNet} surpasses the expressiveness of the classical Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism. Furthermore, we propose a structural- and positional-aware GSSL framework that incorporates topological information throughout the learning process. This approach enables the learning of representations that are both sensitive to graph topology and invariant to specific structural and feature augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on graph classification datasets, including those designed to test structural sensitivity, show that our method consistently outperforms the existing approaches and maintains computational efficiency. Our work significantly advances GSSL's capability in distinguishing graphs with similar local structures but different global topologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Audio Codec (NAC) models have inspired their use in various speech processing tasks, including speech enhancement (SE). In this work, we propose a novel, efficient SE approach by leveraging the pre-quantization output of a pretrained NAC encoder. Unlike prior NAC-based SE methods, which process discrete speech tokens using Language Models (LMs), we perform SE within the continuous embedding space of the pretrained NAC, which is highly compressed along the time dimension for efficient representation. Our lightweight SE model, optimized through an embedding-level loss, delivers results comparable to SE baselines trained on larger datasets, with a significantly lower real-time factor of 0.005. Additionally, our method achieves a low GMAC of 3.94, reducing complexity 18-fold compared to Sepformer in a simulated cloud-based audio transmission environment. This work highlights a new, efficient NAC-based SE solution, particularly suitable for cloud applications where NAC is used to compress audio before transmission.

<p>Abstract: Transformers with linear attention enable fast and parallel training. Moreover, they can be formulated as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for efficient linear-time inference. While extensively evaluated in causal sequence modeling, they have yet to be extended to the bidirectional setting. This work introduces the LION framework, establishing new theoretical foundations for linear transformers in bidirectional sequence modeling. LION constructs a bidirectional RNN equivalent to full Linear Attention. This extends the benefits of linear transformers: parallel training, and efficient inference, into the bidirectional setting. Using LION, we cast three linear transformers to their bidirectional form: LION-LIT, the bidirectional variant corresponding to (Katharopoulos et al., 2020); LION-D, extending RetNet (Sun et al., 2023); and LION-S, a linear transformer with a stable selective mask inspired by selectivity of SSMs (Dao & Gu, 2024). Replacing the attention block with LION (-LIT, -D, -S) achieves performance on bidirectional tasks that approaches that of Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs), while delivering significant improvements in training speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Srivastava, Durgesh Kumar, Ram Jiwari, Sandeep Seth, Deepak Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: The variability in ECG readings influenced by individual patient characteristics has posed a considerable challenge to adopting automated ECG analysis in clinical settings. A novel feature fusion technique termed SACC (Self Attentive Canonical Correlation) was proposed to address this. This technique is combined with DPN (Dual Pathway Network) and depth-wise separable convolution to create a robust, interpretable, and fast end-to-end arrhythmia classification model named rECGnition_v2.0 (robust ECG abnormality detection). This study uses MIT-BIH, INCARTDB and EDB dataset to evaluate the efficiency of rECGnition_v2.0 for various classes of arrhythmias. To investigate the influence of constituting model components, various ablation studies were performed, i.e. simple concatenation, CCA and proposed SACC were compared, while the importance of global and local ECG features were tested using DPN rECGnition_v2.0 model and vice versa. It was also benchmarked with state-of-the-art CNN models for overall accuracy vs model parameters, FLOPs, memory requirements, and prediction time. Furthermore, the inner working of the model was interpreted by comparing the activation locations in ECG before and after the SACC layer. rECGnition_v2.0 showed a remarkable accuracy of 98.07% and an F1-score of 98.05% for classifying ten distinct classes of arrhythmia with just 82.7M FLOPs per sample, thereby going beyond the performance metrics of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by utilizing MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. Similarly, on INCARTDB and EDB datasets, excellent F1-scores of 98.01% and 96.21% respectively was achieved for AAMI classification. The compact architectural footprint of the rECGnition_v2.0, characterized by its lesser trainable parameters and diminished computational demands, unfurled several advantages including interpretability and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley McDanel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the parallels between Thompson's "Reflections on Trusting Trust" and modern challenges in LLM-based code generation. We examine how Thompson's insights about compiler backdoors take on new relevance in the era of large language models, where the mechanisms for potential exploitation are even more opaque and difficult to analyze. Building on this analogy, we discuss how the statistical nature of LLMs creates novel security challenges in code generation pipelines. As a potential direction forward, we propose an ensemble-based validation approach that leverages multiple independent models to detect anomalous code patterns through cross-model consensus. This perspective piece aims to spark discussion about trust and validation in AI-assisted software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Ball, Simeon Allmendinger, Frauke Kreuter, Niklas K\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly used in survey contexts to simulate human preferences. While many research endeavors evaluate the quality of synthetic GenAI data by comparing model-generated responses to gold-standard survey results, fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of using LLMs as substitutes for human respondents remain. Our study provides a technical analysis of how demographic attributes and prompt variations influence latent opinion mappings in large language models (LLMs) and evaluates their suitability for survey-based predictions. Using 14 different models, we find that LLM-generated data fails to replicate the variance observed in real-world human responses, particularly across demographic subgroups. In the political space, persona-to-party mappings exhibit limited differentiation, resulting in synthetic data that lacks the nuanced distribution of opinions found in survey data. Moreover, we show that prompt sensitivity can significantly alter outputs for some models, further undermining the stability and predictiveness of LLM-based simulations. As a key contribution, we adapt a probe-based methodology that reveals how LLMs encode political affiliations in their latent space, exposing the systematic distortions introduced by these models. Our findings highlight critical limitations in AI-generated survey data, urging caution in its use for public opinion research, social science experimentation, and computational behavioral modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megan Tjandrasuwita, Chanakya Ekbote, Liu Ziyin, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal representation learning is fundamentally about transforming incomparable modalities into comparable representations. While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or, in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Wang, Shaozhen Liu, Yu Rong, Deli Zhao, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Establishing the relationship between 3D structures and the energy states of molecular systems has proven to be a promising approach for learning 3D molecular representations. However, existing methods are limited to modeling the molecular energy states from classical mechanics. This limitation results in a significant oversight of quantum mechanical effects, such as quantized (discrete) energy level structures, which offer a more accurate estimation of molecular energy and can be experimentally measured through energy spectra. In this paper, we propose to utilize the energy spectra to enhance the pre-training of 3D molecular representations (MolSpectra), thereby infusing the knowledge of quantum mechanics into the molecular representations. Specifically, we propose SpecFormer, a multi-spectrum encoder for encoding molecular spectra via masked patch reconstruction. By further aligning outputs from the 3D encoder and spectrum encoder using a contrastive objective, we enhance the 3D encoder's understanding of molecules. Evaluations on public benchmarks reveal that our pre-trained representations surpass existing methods in predicting molecular properties and modeling dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yedi Zhang, Lei Huang, Pengfei Gao, Fu Song, Jun Sun, Jin Song Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of neural network security, the resilience of neural networks against bit-flip attacks (i.e., an attacker maliciously flips an extremely small amount of bits within its parameter storage memory system to induce harmful behavior), has emerged as a relevant area of research. Existing studies suggest that quantization may serve as a viable defense against such attacks. Recognizing the documented susceptibility of real-valued neural networks to such attacks and the comparative robustness of quantized neural networks (QNNs), in this work, we introduce BFAVerifier, the first verification framework designed to formally verify the absence of bit-flip attacks or to identify all vulnerable parameters in a sound and rigorous manner. BFAVerifier comprises two integral components: an abstraction-based method and an MILP-based method. Specifically, we first conduct a reachability analysis with respect to symbolic parameters that represent the potential bit-flip attacks, based on a novel abstract domain with a sound guarantee. If the reachability analysis fails to prove the resilience of such attacks, then we encode this verification problem into an equivalent MILP problem which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Therefore, BFAVerifier is sound, complete, and reasonably efficient. We conduct extensive experiments, which demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency across various network architectures, quantization bit-widths, and adversary capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are radically expanding the scope and capability of automation in knowledge work such as academic research. AI-assisted research tools show promise for augmenting human cognition and streamlining research processes, but could potentially increase automation bias and stifle critical thinking. We surveyed the past three years of publications from leading HCI venues. We closely examined 11 AI-assisted research tools, five employing traditional AI approaches and six integrating GenAI, to explore how these systems envision novel capabilities and design spaces. We consolidate four design recommendations that inform cognitive engagement when working with an AI research tool: Providing user agency and control; enabling divergent and convergent thinking; supporting adaptability and flexibility; and ensuring transparency and accuracy. We discuss how these ideas mark a shift in AI-assisted research tools from mimicking a researcher's established workflows to generative co-creation with the researcher and the opportunities this shift affords the research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ege Onur Taga, M. Emrullah Ildiz, Samet Oymak</p>
<p>Abstract: The diversity of time series applications and scarcity of domain-specific data highlight the need for time-series models with strong few-shot learning capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel training scheme and a transformer-based architecture, collectively referred to as TimePFN, for multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting. TimePFN is based on the concept of Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFN), which aims to approximate Bayesian inference. Our approach consists of (1) generating synthetic MTS data through diverse Gaussian process kernels and the linear coregionalization method, and (2) a novel MTS architecture capable of utilizing both temporal and cross-channel dependencies across all input patches. We evaluate TimePFN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models for MTS forecasting in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably, fine-tuning TimePFN with as few as 500 data points nearly matches full dataset training error, and even 50 data points yield competitive results. We also find that TimePFN exhibits strong univariate forecasting performance, attesting to its generalization ability. Overall, this work unlocks the power of synthetic data priors for MTS forecasting and facilitates strong zero- and few-shot forecasting performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mira J\"urgens, Thomas Mortier, Eyke H\"ullermeier, Viktor Bengs, Willem Waegeman</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate representation of epistemic uncertainty is a challenging yet essential task in machine learning. A widely used representation corresponds to convex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular way of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized supervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified through measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In principle, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As a necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of calibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to determine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that is calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework allows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that different ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the input space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules, which inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable, kernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric testing procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level variability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an iterative approach to performing Scientific Named Entity Recognition (SciNER) using BERT-based models. We leverage transfer learning to fine-tune pretrained models with a small but high-quality set of manually annotated data. The process is iteratively refined by using the fine-tuned model to auto-annotate a larger dataset, followed by additional rounds of fine-tuning. We evaluated two models, dslim/bert-large-NER and bert-largecased, and found that bert-large-cased consistently outperformed the former. Our approach demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy and F1 scores, especially for less common entity classes. Future work could include pertaining with unlabeled data, exploring more powerful encoders like RoBERTa, and expanding the scope of manual annotations. This methodology has broader applications in NLP tasks where access to labeled data is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Nourbakhsh, Hoda Mohammadzade</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Alignment is a critical task in signal processing with numerous real-world applications. In practice, signals often exhibit temporal shifts and scaling, making classification on raw data prone to errors. This paper introduces a novel approach for Multiple Time Series Alignment (MTSA) leveraging Deep Learning techniques. While most existing methods primarily address Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) for protein and DNA sequences, there remains a significant gap in alignment methodologies for numerical time series. Additionally, conventional approaches typically focus on pairwise alignment, whereas our proposed method aligns all signals in a multiple manner (all the signals are aligned together at once). This innovation not only enhances alignment efficiency but also significantly improves computational speed. By decomposing into piece-wise linear sections, we introduce varying levels of complexity into the warping function. Additionally, our method ensures the satisfaction of three warping constraints: boundary, monotonicity, and continuity conditions. The utilization of a deep convolutional network allows us to employ a new loss function, addressing some limitations of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experimental results on the UCR Archive 2018, comprising 129 time series datasets, demonstrate that employing our approach to align signals significantly enhances classification accuracy and warping average and also reduces the run time across the majority of these datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Kumar, Rahul Parhi, Mikhail Belkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have characterized the function-space inductive bias of infinite-width bounded-norm single-hidden-layer neural networks as a kind of bounded-variation-type space. This novel neural network Banach space encompasses many classical multivariate function spaces including certain Sobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces. Notably, this Banach space also includes functions that exhibit less classical regularity such as those that only vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established that the Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into this Banach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and the neural network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaces on unbounded domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentally different. We establish the following fundamental result: Certain functions that lie in the Gaussian RKHS have infinite norm in the neural network Banach space. This provides a nontrivial gap between kernel methods and neural networks by the exhibition of functions in which kernel methods can do strictly better than neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Companies across all economic sectors continue to deploy large language models at a rapid pace. Reinforcement learning is experiencing a resurgence of interest due to its association with the fine-tuning of language models from human feedback. Tool-chain language models control task-specific agents; if the converse has not already appeared, it soon will. In this paper, we present what we believe is the first investigation of an intelligent trading agent based on continuous deep reinforcement learning that also controls a large language model with which it can post to a social media feed observed by other traders. We empirically investigate the performance and impact of such an agent in a simulated financial market, finding that it learns to optimize its total reward, and thereby augment its profit, by manipulating the sentiment of the posts it produces. The paper concludes with discussion, limitations, and suggestions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungbok Lee, You Zhang, Zhiyao Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) is to localize and segment the sounding source objects from the video frames. Researchers working on AVS suffer from limited datasets because hand-crafted annotation is expensive. Recent works attempt to overcome the challenge of limited data by leveraging the segmentation foundation model, SAM, prompting it with audio to enhance its ability to segment sounding source objects. While this approach alleviates the model's burden on understanding visual modality by utilizing pre-trained knowledge of SAM, it does not address the fundamental challenge of the limited dataset for learning audio-visual relationships. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AV2T-SAM}, a novel framework that bridges audio features with the text embedding space of pre-trained text-prompted SAM. Our method leverages multimodal correspondence learned from rich text-image paired datasets to enhance audio-visual alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature, $\mathbf{\textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLIP} \odot \textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLAP}}$, which emphasizes shared semantics of audio and visual modalities while filtering irrelevant noise. Experiments on the AVSBench dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both datasets of AVSBench. Our approach outperforms existing methods by effectively utilizing pretrained segmentation models and cross-modal semantic alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophie Xhonneux, David Dobre, Mehrnaz Mohfakhami, Leo Schwinn, Gauthier Gidel</p>
<p>Abstract: Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on related concepts, like, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), proof of personhood, anonymous credentials, personhood credentials (PHCs) emerged as an alternative approach, enabling individuals to verify to digital service providers that they are a person without disclosing additional information. However, new technologies might introduce some friction due to users misunderstandings and mismatched expectations. Despite their growing importance, limited research has been done on users perceptions and preferences regarding PHCs. To address this gap, we conducted competitive analysis, and semi-structured online user interviews with 23 participants from US and EU to provide concrete design recommendations for PHCs that incorporate user needs, adoption rules, and preferences. Our study -- (a)surfaces how people reason about unknown privacy and security guarantees of PHCs compared to current verification methods -- (b) presents the impact of several factors on how people would like to onboard and manage PHCs, including, trusted issuers (e.g. gov), ground truth data to issue PHC (e.g biometrics, physical id), and issuance system (e.g. centralized vs decentralized). In a think-aloud conceptual design session, participants recommended -- conceptualized design, such as periodic biometrics verification, time-bound credentials, visually interactive human-check, and supervision of government for issuance system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex G. C. de S\'a, David B. Ascher</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been playing important roles in drug discovery in the past years by providing (pre-)screening tools for prioritising chemical compounds to pass through wet lab experiments. One of the main ML tasks in drug discovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an activity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound behaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods exist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's personalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since the chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact leads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by the model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to solve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand. Although an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist cheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few works related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces Auto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical ADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or better predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP method, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property prediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's evolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and interpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are designed to predict outcomes using features about an individual, but fail to take into account how individuals can change them. Consequently, models can assign fixed predictions that deny individuals recourse to change their outcome. This work develops a new paradigm to identify fixed predictions by finding confined regions in which all individuals receive fixed predictions. We introduce the first method, ReVer, for this task, using tools from mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming. Our approach certifies recourse for out-of-sample data, provides interpretable descriptions of confined regions, and runs in seconds on real world datasets. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of confined regions across diverse applications. Our results highlight that existing point-wise verification methods fail to discover confined regions, while ReVer provably succeeds.</p>

<p>Abstract: As automated vehicles enter public roads, safety in a near-infinite number of driving scenarios becomes one of the major concerns for the widespread adoption of fully autonomous driving. The ability to detect anomalous situations outside of the operational design domain is a key component in self-driving cars, enabling us to mitigate the impact of abnormal ego behaviors and to realize trustworthy driving systems. On-road anomaly detection in egocentric videos remains a challenging problem due to the difficulties introduced by complex and interactive scenarios. We conduct a holistic analysis of common on-road anomaly patterns, from which we propose three unsupervised anomaly detection experts: a scene expert that focuses on frame-level appearances to detect abnormal scenes and unexpected scene motions; an interaction expert that models normal relative motions between two road participants and raises alarms whenever anomalous interactions emerge; and a behavior expert which monitors abnormal behaviors of individual objects by future trajectory prediction. To combine the strengths of all the modules, we propose an expert ensemble (Xen) using a Kalman filter, in which the final anomaly score is absorbed as one of the states and the observations are generated by the experts. Our experiments employ a novel evaluation protocol for realistic model performance, demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance than previous methods, and show that our framework has potential in classifying anomaly types using unsupervised learning on a large-scale on-road anomaly dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for data science tasks via code generation. However, the exploratory nature of data science, alongside the stochastic and opaque outputs of LLMs, raise concerns about their reliability. While prior work focuses on benchmarking LLM accuracy, reproducibility remains underexplored, despite being critical to establishing trust in LLM-driven analysis.
  We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions.
  Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies. Our results show that higher reproducibility strongly correlates with improved accuracy and reproducibility-enhancing prompts are effective, demonstrating structured prompting's potential to enhance automated data science workflows and enable transparent, robust AI-driven analysis. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning systems are increasingly threatened by data poisoning attacks, where malicious clients compromise global models by contributing tampered updates. Existing defenses often rely on impractical assumptions, such as access to a central test dataset, or fail to generalize across diverse attack types, particularly those involving multiple malicious clients working collaboratively. To address this, we propose Federated Noise-Induced Activation Analysis (FedNIA), a novel defense framework to identify and exclude adversarial clients without relying on any central test dataset. FedNIA injects random noise inputs to analyze the layerwise activation patterns in client models leveraging an autoencoder that detects abnormal behaviors indicative of data poisoning. FedNIA can defend against diverse attack types, including sample poisoning, label flipping, and backdoors, even in scenarios with multiple attacking nodes. Experimental results on non-iid federated datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, underscoring its potential as a foundational approach for enhancing the security of federated learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Providing students with detailed and timely grading feedback is essential for self-learning. While existing LLM-based grading systems are promising, most of them rely on one single model, which limits their performance. To address this, we propose Ensemble Tree-of-Thought (ToT), a framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating multiple models. Using this framework, we develop a grading system. Ensemble ToT follows three steps: (1) analyzing LLM performance, (2) generating candidate answers, and (3) refining them into a final result. Based on this, our grading system first evaluates the grading tendencies of LLMs, then generates multiple results, and finally integrates them via a simulated debate. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's ability to provide accurate and explainable grading by effectively coordinating multiple LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Hallaji, Roozbeh Razavi-Far, Mehrdad Saif</p>
<p>Abstract: The server-less nature of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) requires allocating the aggregation role to specific participants in each federated round. Current DFL architectures ensure the trustworthiness of the aggregator node upon selection. However, most of these studies overlook the possibility that the aggregating node may turn rogue and act maliciously after being nominated. To address this problem, this paper proposes a DFL structure, called TrustChain, that scores the aggregators before selection based on their past behavior and additionally audits them after the aggregation. To do this, the statistical independence between the client updates and the aggregated model is continuously monitored using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The proposed method relies on several principles, including blockchain, anomaly detection, and concept drift analysis. The designed structure is evaluated on several federated datasets and attack scenarios with different numbers of Byzantine nodes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Professionals increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance their capabilities and assist with task execution. While prior research has examined these uses separately, their potential interaction remains underexplored. We propose that AI-driven training (tutor effect) and AI-assisted task completion (tool effect) can be complementary and test this hypothesis in the context of lung cancer diagnosis. In a field experiment with 334 medical students, we manipulated AI deployment in training, in practice, and in both. Our findings reveal that while AI-integrated training and AI assistance independently improved diagnostic performance, their combination yielded the highest accuracy. These results underscore AI's dual role in enhancing human performance through both learning and real-time support, offering insights into AI deployment in professional settings where human expertise remains essential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liancheng Fang, Aiwei Liu, Hengrui Zhang, Henry Peng Zou, Weizhi Zhang, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have achieved encouraging results in tabular data generation. However, existing approaches require fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive. This paper explores an alternative: prompting a fixed LLM with in-context examples. We observe that using randomly selected in-context examples hampers the LLM's performance, resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose a novel in-context learning framework: TabGen-ICL, to enhance the in-context learning ability of LLMs for tabular data generation. TabGen-ICL operates iteratively, retrieving a subset of real samples that represent the residual between currently generated samples and true data distributions. This approach serves two purposes: locally, it provides more effective in-context learning examples for the LLM in each iteration; globally, it progressively narrows the gap between generated and real data. Extensive experiments on five real-world tabular datasets demonstrate that TabGen-ICL significantly outperforms the random selection strategy. Specifically, it reduces the error rate by a margin of $3.5\%-42.2\%$ on fidelity metrics. We demonstrate for the first time that prompting a fixed LLM can yield high-quality synthetic tabular data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nidhal Jegham, Marwan Abdelatti, Abdeltawab Hendawi</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional evaluations of multimodal large language models (LLMs) have been limited by their focus on single-image reasoning, failing to assess crucial aspects like contextual understanding, reasoning stability, and uncertainty calibration. This study addresses these limitations by introducing a novel benchmark that integrates multi-image reasoning tasks with rejection-based evaluation and positional bias detection. To evaluate these dimensions, we further introduce entropy as a novel metric for quantifying reasoning consistency across reordered answer variants. We applied this benchmark to assess Grok 3, ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-o1, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, DeepSeek Janus models, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, QVQ-72B-Preview, and Pixtral 12B across eight visual reasoning tasks, including difference spotting and diagram interpretation. Our findings reveal ChatGPT-o1 leading in overall accuracy (82.5\%) and rejection accuracy (70.0\%), closely followed by Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental (70.8\%). QVQ-72B-Preview demonstrated superior rejection accuracy (85.5\%). Notably, Pixtral 12B (51.7\%) showed promise in specific domains, while Janus models exhibited challenges in bias and uncertainty calibration, reflected in low rejection accuracies and high entropy scores. High entropy scores in Janus models (Janus 7B: 0.8392, Janus 1B: 0.787) underscore their susceptibility to positional bias and unstable reasoning, contrasting with the low entropy and robust reasoning of ChatGPT models. The study further demonstrates that model size is not the sole determinant of performance, as evidenced by Grok 3 underperformance despite its substantial parameter count. By employing multi-image contexts, rejection mechanisms, and entropy-based consistency metrics, this benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating multimodal LLMs, enabling a more robust and reliable assessment of next-generation AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The next token prediction loss is the dominant self-supervised training objective for large language models and has achieved promising results in a variety of downstream tasks. However, upon closer investigation of this objective, we find that it lacks an understanding of sequence-level signals, leading to a mismatch between training and inference processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a contrastive preference optimization (CPO) procedure that can inject sequence-level information into the language model at any training stage without expensive human labeled data. Our experiments show that the proposed objective surpasses the next token prediction in terms of win rate in the instruction-following and text generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models for image generation are now commonly used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from guided image generation for entertainment to solving inverse problems. Nonetheless, training a generator is a non-trivial feat that requires fine-tuning and can lead to so-called hallucinations, that is, the generation of images that are unrealistic. In this work, we explore image generation using flow matching. We explain and demonstrate why flow matching can generate hallucinations, and propose an iterative process to improve the generation process. Our iterative process can be integrated into virtually $\textit{any}$ generative modeling technique, thereby enhancing the performance and robustness of image synthesis systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Tang, Jing Long, Junmei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Auxiliary Discriminator Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks (ADSeqGAN), a novel approach for molecular generation in small-sample datasets. Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity.
  Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility.
  Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devanish N. Kamtam, Joseph B. Shrager, Satya Deepya Malla, Nicole Lin, Juan J. Cardona, Jake J. Kim, Clarence Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction: Computer vision (CV) has had a transformative impact in biomedical fields such as radiology, dermatology, and pathology. Its real-world adoption in surgical applications, however, remains limited. We review the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning (DL)-based CV models for segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures in videos obtained during surgical procedures.
  Methods: We conducted a scoping review of studies on semantic segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures published between 2014 and 2024 from 3 major databases - PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore. The primary objective was to evaluate the state-of-the-art performance of semantic segmentation in surgical videos. Secondary objectives included examining DL models, progress toward clinical applications, and the specific challenges with segmentation of organs/tissues in surgical videos.
  Results: We identified 58 relevant published studies. These focused predominantly on procedures from general surgery [20(34.4%)], colorectal surgery [9(15.5%)], and neurosurgery [8(13.8%)]. Cholecystectomy [14(24.1%)] and low anterior rectal resection [5(8.6%)] were the most common procedures addressed. Semantic segmentation [47(81%)] was the primary CV task. U-Net [14(24.1%)] and DeepLab [13(22.4%)] were the most widely used models. Larger organs such as the liver (Dice score: 0.88) had higher accuracy compared to smaller structures such as nerves (Dice score: 0.49). Models demonstrated real-time inference potential ranging from 5-298 frames-per-second (fps).
  Conclusion: This review highlights the significant progress made in DL-based semantic segmentation for surgical videos with real-time applicability, particularly for larger organs. Addressing challenges with smaller structures, data availability, and generalizability remains crucial for future advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Shangguan, Daniel Seita, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in cross-modal feature extraction and integration have significantly enhanced performance in few-shot learning tasks. However, current multi-modal object detection (MM-OD) methods often experience notable performance degradation when encountering substantial domain shifts. We propose that incorporating rich textual information can enable the model to establish a more robust knowledge relationship between visual instances and their corresponding language descriptions, thereby mitigating the challenges of domain shift. Specifically, we focus on the problem of Cross-Domain Multi-Modal Few-Shot Object Detection (CDMM-FSOD) and introduce a meta-learning-based framework designed to leverage rich textual semantics as an auxiliary modality to achieve effective domain adaptation. Our new architecture incorporates two key components: (i) A multi-modal feature aggregation module, which aligns visual and linguistic feature embeddings to ensure cohesive integration across modalities. (ii) A rich text semantic rectification module, which employs bidirectional text feature generation to refine multi-modal feature alignment, thereby enhancing understanding of language and its application in object detection. We evaluate the proposed method on common cross-domain object detection benchmarks and demonstrate that it significantly surpasses existing few-shot object detection approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinbo Yan, Alan Zhao, Yixin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image 3D generation has emerged as a prominent research topic, playing a vital role in virtual reality, 3D modeling, and digital content creation. However, existing methods face challenges such as a lack of multi-view geometric consistency and limited controllability during the generation process, which significantly restrict their usability. % To tackle these challenges, we introduce Dragen3D, a novel approach that achieves geometrically consistent and controllable 3D generation leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce the Anchor-Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (Anchor-GS VAE), which encodes a point cloud and a single image into anchor latents and decode these latents into 3DGS, enabling efficient latent-space generation. To enable multi-view geometry consistent and controllable generation, we propose a Seed-Point-Driven strategy: first generate sparse seed points as a coarse geometry representation, then map them to anchor latents via the Seed-Anchor Mapping Module. Geometric consistency is ensured by the easily learned sparse seed points, and users can intuitively drag the seed points to deform the final 3DGS geometry, with changes propagated through the anchor latents. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve geometrically controllable 3D Gaussian generation and editing without relying on 2D diffusion priors, delivering comparable 3D generation quality to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In critical care settings, where precise and timely interventions are crucial for health outcomes, evaluating disparities in patient outcomes is essential. Current approaches often fail to fully capture the impact of respiratory support interventions on individuals affected by social determinants of health. While attributes such as gender, race, and age are commonly assessed and provide valuable insights, they offer only a partial view of the complexities faced by diverse populations. In this study, we focus on two clinically motivated tasks: prolonged mechanical ventilation and successful weaning. Additionally, we conduct fairness audits on the models' predictions across demographic groups and social determinants of health to better understand health inequities in respiratory interventions within the intensive care unit. Furthermore, we release a temporal benchmark dataset, verified by clinical experts, to facilitate benchmarking of clinical respiratory intervention tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Yang, Yucai Pang, Hongbo Yin, Yunpeng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new Transformer, called MS$^2$Dformer, that can be used as a generalized backbone for multi-modal sequence spammer detection. Spammer detection is a complex multi-modal task, thus the challenges of applying Transformer are two-fold. Firstly, complex multi-modal noisy information about users can interfere with feature mining. Secondly, the long sequence of users' historical behaviors also puts a huge GPU memory pressure on the attention computation. To solve these problems, we first design a user behavior Tokenization algorithm based on the multi-modal variational autoencoder (MVAE). Subsequently, a hierarchical split-window multi-head attention (SW/W-MHA) mechanism is proposed. The split-window strategy transforms the ultra-long sequences hierarchically into a combination of intra-window short-term and inter-window overall attention. Pre-trained on the public datasets, MS$^2$Dformer's performance far exceeds the previous state of the art. The experiments demonstrate MS$^2$Dformer's ability to act as a backbone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Gong, Yekun Ke, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The expressive power and computational complexity of deep visual generative models, such as flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models, have gained considerable interest for their wide-ranging applications in generative tasks. However, the theoretical characterization of their expressiveness through the lens of circuit complexity remains underexplored, particularly for the state-of-the-art architecture like FlowAR proposed by [Ren et al., 2024], which integrates flow-based and autoregressive mechanisms. This gap limits our understanding of their inherent computational limits and practical efficiency. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the circuit complexity of the FlowAR architecture. We demonstrate that when the largest feature map produced by the FlowAR model has dimensions $n \times n \times c$, the FlowAR model is simulable by a family of threshold circuits $\mathsf{TC}^0$, which have constant depth $O(1)$ and polynomial width $\mathrm{poly}(n)$. This is the first study to rigorously highlight the limitations in the expressive power of FlowAR models. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the FlowAR model computations can achieve almost quadratic time. To validate our theoretical findings, we present efficient model variant constructions based on low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. Our work provides a foundation for future comparisons with other generative paradigms and guides the development of more efficient and expressive implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Hu, Muning Wen, Xihuai Wang, Shao Zhang, Yiwei Shi, Minne Li, Minglong Li, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in coordinating agents due to complex interdependencies within multi-agent systems. Most MARL algorithms use the simultaneous decision-making paradigm but ignore the action-level dependencies among agents, which reduces coordination efficiency. In contrast, the sequential decision-making paradigm provides finer-grained supervision for agent decision order, presenting the potential for handling dependencies via better decision order management. However, determining the optimal decision order remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Action Generation with Plackett-Luce Sampling (AGPS), a novel mechanism for agent decision order optimization. We model the order determination task as a Plackett-Luce sampling process to address issues such as ranking instability and vanishing gradient during the network training process. AGPS realizes credit-based decision order determination by establishing a bridge between the significance of agents' local observations and their decision credits, thus facilitating order optimization and dependency management. Integrating AGPS with the Multi-Agent Transformer, we propose the Prioritized Multi-Agent Transformer (PMAT), a sequential decision-making MARL algorithm with decision order optimization. Experiments on benchmarks including StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo show that PMAT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, greatly enhancing coordination efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parody is an emerging phenomenon on social media, where individuals imitate a role or position opposite to their own, often for humor, provocation, or controversy. Detecting and analyzing parody can be challenging and is often reliant on context, yet it plays a crucial role in understanding cultural values, promoting subcultures, and enhancing self-expression. However, the study of parody is hindered by limited available data and deficient diversity in current datasets. To bridge this gap, we built seven parody datasets from both English and Chinese corpora, with 14,755 annotated users and 21,210 annotated comments in total. To provide sufficient context information, we also collect replies and construct user-interaction graphs to provide richer contextual information, which is lacking in existing datasets. With these datasets, we test traditional methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) on three key tasks: (1) parody detection, (2) comment sentiment analysis with parody, and (3) user sentiment analysis with parody. Our extensive experiments reveal that parody-related tasks still remain challenging for all models, and contextual information plays a critical role. Interestingly, we find that, in certain scenarios, traditional sentence embedding methods combined with simple classifiers can outperform advanced LLMs, i.e. DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o3, highlighting parody as a significant challenge for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Cohen, Itzik Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate underwater navigation is a challenging task due to the absence of global navigation satellite system signals and the reliance on inertial navigation systems that suffer from drift over time. Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) are typically used to mitigate this drift through velocity measurements, which are commonly estimated using a parameter estimation approach such as least squares (LS). However, LS works under the assumption of ideal conditions and does not account for sensor biases, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a data-driven alternative based on multi-output Gaussian process regression (MOGPR) to improve DVL velocity estimation. MOGPR provides velocity estimates and associated measurement covariances, enabling an adaptive integration within an error-state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world AUV data and compare it against LS and a state-of-the-art deep learning model, BeamsNet. Results demonstrate that MOGPR reduces velocity estimation errors by approximately 20% while simultaneously enhancing overall navigation accuracy, particularly in the orientation states. Additionally, the incorporation of uncertainty estimates from MOGPR enables an adaptive EKF framework, improving navigation robustness in dynamic underwater environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishwajit Prasad Gond</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of supply chains and the rising costs associated with defective or substandard goods (bad goods) highlight the urgent need for advanced predictive methodologies to mitigate risks and enhance operational efficiency. This research presents a novel framework that integrates Time Series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models with a proprietary formula specifically designed to calculate bad goods after time series forecasting. By leveraging historical data patterns, including sales, returns, and capacity, the model forecasts potential quality failures, enabling proactive decision-making. ARIMA is employed to capture temporal trends in time series data, while the newly developed formula quantifies the likelihood and impact of defects with greater precision. Experimental results, validated on a dataset spanning 2022-2024 for Organic Beer-G 1 Liter, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional statistical models, such as Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters, in both prediction accuracy and risk evaluation. This study advances the field of predictive analytics by bridging time series forecasting, ARIMA, and risk management in supply chain quality control, offering a scalable and practical solution for minimizing losses due to bad goods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Wu, Viktor Schlegel, Riza Batista-Navarro</p>
<p>Abstract: As neural language models achieve human-comparable performance on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and see widespread adoption, ensuring their robustness in real-world scenarios has become increasingly important. Current robustness evaluation research, though, primarily develops synthetic perturbation methods, leaving unclear how well they reflect real life scenarios. Considering this, we present a framework to automatically examine MRC models on naturally occurring textual perturbations, by replacing paragraph in MRC benchmarks with their counterparts based on available Wikipedia edit history. Such perturbation type is natural as its design does not stem from an arteficial generative process, inherently distinct from the previously investigated synthetic approaches. In a large-scale study encompassing SQUAD datasets and various model architectures we observe that natural perturbations result in performance degradation in pre-trained encoder language models. More worryingly, these state-of-the-art Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit these errors. Further experiments demonstrate that our findings generalise to natural perturbations found in other more challenging MRC benchmarks. In an effort to mitigate these errors, we show that it is possible to improve the robustness to natural perturbations by training on naturally or synthetically perturbed examples, though a noticeable gap still remains compared to performance on unperturbed data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaohao Yuan, Kangfei Zhao, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu, Liang Wang, Tingyang Xu, Wenbing Huang, Deli Zhao, Hong Cheng, Yu Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated a strong capability in modeling graph structures by addressing the intrinsic limitations of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Recent studies have proposed diverse architectures, enhanced explainability, and practical applications for Graph Transformers. In light of these rapid developments, we conduct a comprehensive review of Graph Transformers, covering aspects such as their architectures, theoretical foundations, and applications within this survey. We categorize the architecture of Graph Transformers according to their strategies for processing structural information, including graph tokenization, positional encoding, structure-aware attention and model ensemble. Furthermore, from the theoretical perspective, we examine the expressivity of Graph Transformers in various discussed architectures and contrast them with other advanced graph learning algorithms to discover the connections. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the practical applications where Graph Transformers have been utilized, such as molecule, protein, language, vision traffic, brain and material data. At the end of this survey, we will discuss the current challenges and prospective directions in Graph Transformers for potential future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Rystr{\o}m, Hannah Rose Kirk, Scott Hale</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Cai Chen, Yi Pin Xu, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting parameters from technical documentation is crucial for ensuring design precision and simulation reliability in electronic design. However, current methods struggle to handle high-dimensional design data and meet the demands of real-time processing. In electronic design automation (EDA), engineers often manually search through extensive documents to retrieve component parameters required for constructing PySpice models, a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the extraction of parameters and the generation of PySpice models directly from datasheets. Our framework introduces three Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based techniques: (1) Targeted Document Retrieval (TDR), which enables the rapid identification of relevant technical sections; (2) Iterative Retrieval Optimization (IRO), which refines the parameter search through iterative improvements; and (3) Preference Optimization (PO), which dynamically prioritizes key document sections based on relevance. Experimental results show that applying all three methods together improves retrieval precision by 47.69% and reduces processing latency by 37.84%. Furthermore, effect size analysis using Cohen's d reveals that PO significantly reduces latency, while IRO contributes most to precision enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of our framework to streamline EDA processes, enhance design accuracy, and shorten development timelines. Additionally, our algorithm has model-agnostic generalization, meaning it can improve parameter search performance across different LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhou Chen, Xiumei Wang, Jinyang Sun, Xi Chen, Heyu Chu, Guo Song, Yuji Luo, Xingping Zhou, Rong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with millons of deaths each year, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies. While significant progress has been made in the field of heart failure, leading to improved survival rates and improvement of ejection fraction, there remains substantial unmet needs, due to the complexity and multifactorial characteristics. Therefore, we propose a composable strategy framework for assessment and treatment optimization in heart failure. This framework simulates the doctor-patient consultation process and leverages multi-modal algorithms to analyze a range of data, including video, physical examination, text results as well as medical history. By integrating these various data sources, our framework offers a more holistic evaluation and optimized treatment plan for patients. Our results demonstrate that this multi-modal approach outperforms single-modal artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in terms of accuracy in heart failure (HF) prognosis prediction. Through this method, we can further evaluate the impact of various pathological indicators on HF prognosis,providing a more comprehensive evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Kuzmanko</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform when tackling quantitative management decision problems in a zero-shot setting. Drawing on 900 responses generated by five leading models across 20 diverse managerial scenarios, our analysis explores whether these base models can deliver accurate numerical decisions under varying presentation formats, scenario complexities, and repeated attempts. Contrary to prior findings, we observed no significant effects of text presentation format (direct, narrative, or tabular) or text length on accuracy. However, scenario complexity -- particularly in terms of constraints and irrelevant parameters -- strongly influenced performance, often degrading accuracy. Surprisingly, the models handled tasks requiring multiple solution steps more effectively than expected. Notably, only 28.8\% of responses were exactly correct, highlighting limitations in precision. We further found no significant ``learning effect'' across iterations: performance remained stable across repeated queries. Nonetheless, significant variations emerged among the five tested LLMs, with some showing superior binary accuracy. Overall, these findings underscore both the promise and the pitfalls of harnessing LLMs for complex quantitative decision-making, informing managers and researchers about optimal deployment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengqing Wu, Takayuki Ito</p>
<p>Abstract: Consensus formation is pivotal in multi-agent systems (MAS), balancing collective coherence with individual diversity. Conventional LLM-based MAS primarily rely on explicit coordination, e.g., prompts or voting, risking premature homogenization. We argue that implicit consensus, where agents exchange information yet independently form decisions via in-context learning, can be more effective in dynamic environments that require long-horizon adaptability. By retaining partial diversity, systems can better explore novel strategies and cope with external shocks. We formalize a consensus-diversity tradeoff, showing conditions where implicit methods outperform explicit ones. Experiments on three scenarios -- Dynamic Disaster Response, Information Spread and Manipulation, and Dynamic Public-Goods Provision -- confirm partial deviation from group norms boosts exploration, robustness, and performance. We highlight emergent coordination via in-context learning, underscoring the value of preserving diversity for resilient decision-making.</p>

In this work, we introduce Entropy-Lens, a scalable, model-agnostic framework that leverages information theory to interpret frozen, off-the-shelf large-scale transformers. By quantifying the evolution of Shannon entropy within intermediate residual streams, our approach extracts computational signatures that distinguish model families, categorize task-specific prompts, and correlate with output accuracy. We further demonstrate the generality of our method by extending the analysis to vision transformers.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in audio tokenization have significantly enhanced the integration of audio capabilities into large language models (LLMs). However, audio understanding and generation are often treated as distinct tasks, hindering the development of truly unified audio-language models. While instruction tuning has demonstrated remarkable success in improving generalization and zero-shot learning across text and vision, its application to audio remains largely unexplored. A major obstacle is the lack of comprehensive datasets that unify audio understanding and generation. To address this, we introduce Audio-FLAN, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset covering 80 diverse tasks across speech, music, and sound domains, with over 100 million instances. Audio-FLAN lays the foundation for unified audio-language models that can seamlessly handle both understanding (e.g., transcription, comprehension) and generation (e.g., speech, music, sound) tasks across a wide range of audio domains in a zero-shot manner. The Audio-FLAN dataset is available on HuggingFace and GitHub and will be continuously updated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Zewei Zhou, Zhaoyi Wang, Yangjie Ji, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides across diverse multimodal tasks and benchmarks. This paper reveals a largely under-explored problem from existing video-involved LVLMs - language bias, where models tend to prioritize language over video and thus result in incorrect responses. To address this research gap, we first collect a Video Language Bias Evaluation Benchmark, which is specifically designed to assess the language bias in video-involved LVLMs through two key tasks: ambiguous video contrast and interrogative question probing. Accordingly, we design accompanied evaluation metrics that aim to penalize LVLMs being biased by language. In addition, we also propose Multi-branch Contrastive Decoding (MCD), introducing two expert branches to simultaneously counteract language bias potentially generated by the amateur text-only branch. Our experiments demonstrate that i) existing video-involved LVLMs, including both proprietary and open-sourced, are largely limited by the language bias problem; ii) our MCD can effectively mitigate this issue and maintain general-purpose capabilities in various video-involved LVLMs without any additional retraining or alteration to model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Caetano, Christiaan Viviers, Lena Filatova, Peter H. N. de With, Fons van der Sommen</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the quality and integrity of medical images is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy in deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis and Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems. Covariate shifts are subtle variations in the data distribution caused by different imaging devices or settings and can severely degrade model performance, similar to the effects of adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is vital to have a lightweight and fast method to assess the quality of these images prior to using CAD models. AdverX-Ray addresses this need by serving as an image-quality assessment layer, designed to detect covariate shifts effectively. This Adversarial Variational Autoencoder prioritizes the discriminator's role, using the suboptimal outputs of the generator as negative samples to fine-tune the discriminator's ability to identify high-frequency artifacts. Images generated by adversarial networks often exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, guiding the discriminator to focus excessively on these components. This makes the discriminator ideal for this approach. Trained on patches from X-ray images of specific machine models, AdverX-Ray can evaluate whether a scan matches the training distribution, or if a scan from the same machine is captured under different settings. Extensive comparisons with various OOD detection methods show that AdverX-Ray significantly outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 96.2% average AUROC using only 64 random patches from an X-ray. Its lightweight and fast architecture makes it suitable for real-time applications, enhancing the reliability of medical imaging systems. The code and pretrained models are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Xu, Yiyuan Yang, Niki Trigoni, Andrew Markham</p>
<p>Abstract: Target speaker extraction focuses on isolating a specific speaker's voice from an audio mixture containing multiple speakers. To provide information about the target speaker's identity, prior works have utilized clean audio examples as conditioning inputs. However, such clean audio examples are not always readily available (e.g. It is impractical to obtain a clean audio example of a stranger's voice at a cocktail party without stepping away from the noisy environment). Limited prior research has explored extracting the target speaker's characteristics from noisy audio examples, which may include overlapping speech from disturbing speakers. In this work, we focus on target speaker extraction when multiple speakers are present during the enrollment stage, through leveraging differences between audio segments where the target speakers are speaking (Positive Enrollments) and segments where they are not (Negative Enrollments). Experiments show the effectiveness of our model architecture and the dedicated pretraining method for the proposed task. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the proposed application settings and demonstrates strong generalizability across challenging and realistic scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal content on social media presents significant challenges in understanding and moderating complex, context-dependent issues such as misinformation, hate speech, and propaganda. While efforts have been made to develop resources and propose new methods for automatic detection, limited attention has been given to label detection and the generation of explanation-based rationales for predicted labels.

To solve these tasks, we propose a multi-stage optimization approach and train Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves performance over the base model for both \textbf{label detection} and explanation generation, outperforming the current state-of-the-art with an absolute improvement of ~3% on ArMeme and ~7% on Hateful Memes.

<p>Abstract: Intelligent tutors have proven to be effective in K-12 education, though their impact on adult learners -- especially as a supplementary resource -- remains underexplored. Understanding how adults voluntarily engage with educational technologies can inform the design of tools that support skill re-learning and enhancement. More critically, it helps determine whether tutoring systems, which are typically built for K-12 learners, can also support adult populations. This study examines the adoption, usage patterns, and effectiveness of a novel tutoring system, Apprentice Tutors, among adult learners at a state technical college. We analyze three types of data including, user demographics, grades, and tutor interactions, to assess whether voluntary tutor usage translates into measurable learning gains. Our findings reveal key temporal patterns in tutor engagement and provide evidence of learning within tutors, as determined through skill improvement in knowledge components across tutors. We also found evidence that this learning transferred outside the tutor, as observed through higher course assessment scores following tutor usage. These results suggest that intelligent tutors are a viable tool for adult learners, warranting further research into their long-term impact on this population.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI models, renowned for their ability to synthesize high-quality content, have sparked growing concerns over the improper generation of copyright-protected material. While recent studies have proposed various approaches to address copyright issues, the capability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect copyright infringements remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on evaluating the copyright detection abilities of state-of-the-art LVLMs using a various set of image samples. Recognizing the absence of a comprehensive dataset that includes both IP-infringement samples and ambiguous non-infringement negative samples, we construct a benchmark dataset comprising positive samples that violate the copyright protection of well-known IP figures, as well as negative samples that resemble these figures but do not raise copyright concerns. This dataset is created using advanced prompt engineering techniques. We then evaluate leading LVLMs using our benchmark dataset. Our experimental results reveal that LVLMs are prone to overfitting, leading to the misclassification of some negative samples as IP-infringement cases. In the final section, we analyze these failure cases and propose potential solutions to mitigate the overfitting problem.</p>

Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 1.63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruichu Cai, Junxian Huang, Zhenhui Yang, Zijian Li, Emadeldeen Eldele, Min Wu, Fuchun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series domain adaptation aims to transfer the complex temporal dependence from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Recent advances leverage the stable causal mechanism over observed variables to model the domain-invariant temporal dependence. However, modeling precise causal structures in high-dimensional data, such as videos, remains challenging. Additionally, direct causal edges may not exist among observed variables (e.g., pixels). These limitations hinder the applicability of existing approaches to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we find that the high-dimension time series data are generated from the low-dimension latent variables, which motivates us to model the causal mechanisms of the temporal latent process. Based on this intuition, we propose a latent causal mechanism identification framework that guarantees the uniqueness of the reconstructed latent causal structures. Specifically, we first identify latent variables by utilizing sufficient changes in historical information. Moreover, by enforcing the sparsity of the relationships of latent variables, we can achieve identifiable latent causal structures. Built on the theoretical results, we develop the Latent Causality Alignment (LCA) model that leverages variational inference, which incorporates an intra-domain latent sparsity constraint for latent structure reconstruction and an inter-domain latent sparsity constraint for domain-invariant structure reconstruction. Experiment results on eight benchmarks show a general improvement in the domain-adaptive time series classification and forecasting tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Qu, David Aponte, Colby Banbury, Daniel P. Robinson, Tianyu Ding, Kazuhito Koishida, Ilya Zharkov, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning and quantization are fundamental techniques used to reduce the size of deep neural networks (DNNs) and typically are applied independently. Applying these techniques jointly via co-optimization has the potential to produce smaller, high-quality models. However, existing joint schemes are not widely used because of (1) engineering difficulties (complicated multi-stage processes), (2) black-box optimization (extensive hyperparameter tuning to control the overall compression), and (3) insufficient architecture generalization. To address these limitations, we present the framework GETA, which automatically and efficiently performs joint structured pruning and quantization-aware training on any DNNs. GETA introduces three key innovations: (i) a quantization-aware dependency graph (QADG) that constructs a pruning search space for generic quantization-aware DNN, (ii) a partially projected stochastic gradient method that guarantees layerwise bit constraints are satisfied, and (iii) a new joint learning strategy that incorporates interpretable relationships between pruning and quantization. We present numerical experiments on both convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures that show that our approach achieves competitive (often superior) performance compared to existing joint pruning and quantization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlong Wang, Zhaoyang Chu, Zhengxiang Cheng, Xuyi Yang, Kaiyue Qiu, Yao Wan, Zhou Zhao, Xuanhua Shi, Dongping Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance in software engineering yet face challenges in adapting to continually evolving code knowledge, particularly regarding the frequent updates of third-party library APIs. This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets, often results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety and efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for identifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge updates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop CODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay synchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs from six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three evaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of 2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of advanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe that our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more effective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thiem Nguyen, Anh Nguyen, Quyen Tran, Tu Vu, Diep Nguyen, Linh Ngo, Thien Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Typically, Few-shot Continual Relation Extraction (FCRE) models must balance retaining prior knowledge while adapting to new tasks with extremely limited data. However, real-world scenarios may also involve unseen or undetermined relations that existing methods still struggle to handle. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages the Open Information Extraction concept of Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC). Our method not only exposes models to all possible pairs of relations, including determined and undetermined labels not available in the training set, but also enriches model knowledge with diverse relation descriptions, thereby enhancing knowledge retention and adaptability in this challenging scenario. In the perspective of KGC, this is the first work explored in the setting of Continual Learning, allowing efficient expansion of the graph as the data evolves. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art FCRE baselines, as well as the efficiency in handling dynamic graph construction in this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiteng Zhao, Chang Ma, FangZhi Xu, Lingpeng Kong, Zhi-Hong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengzhi Li, Megan Tjandrasuwita, Yi R. Fung, Armando Solar-Lezama, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important as AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities. However, current works in artificial social reasoning all rely on language-only, or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel source of data rich in nonverbal and social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting non-verbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 221 videos from YouTube, through rigorous annotation and verification, resulting in a benchmark with 101 videos and 806 question-answer pairs. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that their overall accuracy ranges from 15-30%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. Our data resources are released at https://github.com/MIT-MI/MimeQA to inspire future work in foundation models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhash Kantamneni, Joshua Engels, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Max Tegmark, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for interpreting concepts represented in large language model (LLM) activations. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the validity of their interpretations due to the lack of a ground truth for the concepts used by an LLM, and a growing number of works have presented problems with current SAEs. One alternative source of evidence would be demonstrating that SAEs improve performance on downstream tasks beyond existing baselines. We test this by applying SAEs to the real-world task of LLM activation probing in four regimes: data scarcity, class imbalance, label noise, and covariate shift. Due to the difficulty of detecting concepts in these challenging settings, we hypothesize that SAEs' basis of interpretable, concept-level latents should provide a useful inductive bias. However, although SAEs occasionally perform better than baselines on individual datasets, we are unable to design ensemble methods combining SAEs with baselines that consistently outperform ensemble methods solely using baselines. Additionally, although SAEs initially appear promising for identifying spurious correlations, detecting poor dataset quality, and training multi-token probes, we are able to achieve similar results with simple non-SAE baselines as well. Though we cannot discount SAEs' utility on other tasks, our findings highlight the shortcomings of current SAEs and the need to rigorously evaluate interpretability methods on downstream tasks with strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayeon Ki, Marine Carpuat</p>
<p>Abstract: Can we improve machine translation (MT) with LLMs by rewriting their inputs automatically? Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is easier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text in many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily exploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of 21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English into 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective MT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using quality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms that simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT. These results suggest LLM-assisted input rewriting as a promising direction for improving translations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Babu Piskala, Vijay Raajaa, Sachin Mishra, Bruno Bozza</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4, BART, and LLaMA, the need for a system that can intelligently select the most suitable model for specific tasks while balancing cost, latency, accuracy, and ethical considerations has become increasingly important. Recognizing that not all tasks necessitate models with over 100 billion parameters, we introduce OptiRoute, an advanced model routing engine designed to dynamically select and route tasks to the optimal LLM based on detailed user-defined requirements. OptiRoute captures both functional (e.g., accuracy, speed, cost) and non-functional (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty) criteria, leveraging lightweight task analysis and complexity estimation to efficiently match tasks with the best-fit models from a diverse array of LLMs. By employing a hybrid approach combining k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search and hierarchical filtering, OptiRoute optimizes for user priorities while minimizing computational overhead. This makes it ideal for real-time applications in cloud-based ML platforms, personalized AI services, and regulated industries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irene Solaiman, Rishi Bommasani, Dan Hendrycks, Ariel Herbert-Voss, Yacine Jernite, Aviya Skowron, Andrew Trask</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI release decisions determine whether system components are made available, but release does not address many other elements that change how users and stakeholders are able to engage with a system. Beyond release, access to system components informs potential risks and benefits. Access refers to practical needs, infrastructurally, technically, and societally, in order to use available components in some way. We deconstruct access along three axes: resourcing, technical usability, and utility. Within each category, a set of variables per system component clarify tradeoffs. For example, resourcing requires access to computing infrastructure to serve model weights. We also compare the accessibility of four high performance language models, two open-weight and two closed-weight, showing similar considerations for all based instead on access variables. Access variables set the foundation for being able to scale or increase access to users; we examine the scale of access and how scale affects ability to manage and intervene on risks. This framework better encompasses the landscape and risk-benefit tradeoffs of system releases to inform system release decisions, research, and policy.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16704">Code Summarization Beyond Function Level</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Makharev, Vladimir Ivanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Code summarization is a critical task in natural language processing and software engineering, which aims to generate concise descriptions of source code. Recent advancements have improved the quality of these summaries, enhancing code readability and maintainability. However, the content of a repository or a class has not been considered in function code summarization. This study investigated the effectiveness of code summarization models beyond the function level, exploring the impact of class and repository contexts on the summary quality. The study involved revising benchmarks for evaluating models at class and repository levels, assessing baseline models, and evaluating LLMs with in-context learning to determine the enhancement of summary quality with additional context. The findings revealed that the fine-tuned state-of-the-art CodeT5+ base model excelled in code summarization, while incorporating few-shot learning and retrieved code chunks from RAG significantly enhanced the performance of LLMs in this task. Notably, the Deepseek Coder 1.3B and Starcoder2 15B models demonstrated substantial improvements in metrics such as BLEURT, METEOR, and BLEU-4 at both class and repository levels. Repository-level summarization exhibited promising potential but necessitates significant computational resources and gains from the inclusion of structured context. Lastly, we employed the recent SIDE code summarization metric in our evaluation. This study contributes to refining strategies for prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and RAG, addressing gaps in benchmarks for code summarization at various levels. Finally, we publish all study details, code, datasets, and results of evaluation in the GitHub repository available at https://github.com/kilimanj4r0/code-summarization-beyond-function-level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Light, Wei Cheng, Wu Yue, Masafumi Oyamada, Mengdi Wang, Santiago Paternain, Haifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many inference scaling methods work by breaking a problem into smaller steps (or groups of tokens), then sampling and choosing the best next step. However, these steps and their sizes are usually predetermined based on human intuition or domain knowledge. This paper introduces dynamic decomposition, a method that automatically and adaptively splits solution and reasoning traces into steps during inference. This approach improves computational efficiency by focusing more resources on difficult steps, breaking them down further and prioritizing their sampling. Experiments on coding and math benchmarks (APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench) show that dynamic decomposition performs better than static methods, which rely on fixed steps like token-level, sentence-level, or single-step decompositions. These results suggest that dynamic decomposition can enhance many inference scaling techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhai Feng, Jiaming Han, Zhuoran Yang, Xiangyu Yue, Sergey Levine, Jianlan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving complex long-horizon robotic manipulation problems requires sophisticated high-level planning capabilities, the ability to reason about the physical world, and reactively choose appropriate motor skills. Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet data could in principle offer a framework for tackling such problems. However, in their current form, VLMs lack both the nuanced understanding of intricate physics required for robotic manipulation and the ability to reason over long horizons to address error compounding issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time computation framework that enhances VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves a pretrained VLM with a "reflection" mechanism - it uses a generative model to imagine future world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art commercial VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

<p>Abstract: The growing demand for data privacy in Machine Learning (ML) applications has seen Machine Unlearning (MU) emerge as a critical area of research. As the `right to be forgotten' becomes regulated globally, it is increasingly important to develop mechanisms that delete user data from AI systems while maintaining performance and scalability of these systems. Incremental Unlearning (IU) is a promising MU solution to address the challenges of efficiently removing specific data from ML models without the need for expensive and time-consuming full retraining. This paper presents the various techniques and approaches to IU. It explores the challenges faced in designing and implementing IU mechanisms. Datasets and metrics for evaluating the performance of unlearning techniques are discussed as well. Finally, potential solutions to the IU challenges alongside future research directions are offered. This survey provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand the current landscape of IU and its potential for enhancing privacy-preserving intelligent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Snehesh Shrestha, Yantian Zha, Saketh Banagiri, Ge Gao, Yiannis Aloimonos, Cornelia Ferm\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) datasets emphasize the integration of speech and gestures, allowing robots to absorb explicit knowledge and tacit understanding. However, existing datasets primarily focus on elementary tasks like object pointing and pushing, limiting their applicability to complex domains. They prioritize simpler human command data but place less emphasis on training robots to correctly interpret tasks and respond appropriately. To address these gaps, we present the NatSGLD dataset, which was collected using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method, where participants interacted with a robot they believed to be autonomous. NatSGLD records humans' multimodal commands (speech and gestures), each paired with a demonstration trajectory and a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that provides a ground-truth interpretation of the commanded tasks. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for research at the intersection of HRI and machine learning. By providing multimodal inputs and detailed annotations, NatSGLD enables exploration in areas such as multimodal instruction following, plan recognition, and human-advisable reinforcement learning from demonstrations. We release the dataset and code under the MIT License at https://www.snehesh.com/natsgld/ to support future HRI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suneel Nadipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained transformers is a powerful technique for enhancing the performance of base models on specific tasks. From early applications in models like BERT to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), this approach has been instrumental in adapting general-purpose architectures for specialized downstream tasks. Understanding the fine-tuning process is crucial for uncovering how transformers adapt to specific objectives, retain general representations, and acquire task-specific features. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of fine-tuning, specifically in the BERT transformer, by analyzing activation similarity, training Sparse AutoEncoders (SAEs), and visualizing token-level activations across different layers. Based on experiments conducted across multiple datasets and BERT layers, we observe a steady progression in how features adapt to the task at hand: early layers primarily retain general representations, middle layers act as a transition between general and task-specific features, and later layers fully specialize in task adaptation. These findings provide key insights into the inner workings of fine-tuning and its impact on representation learning within transformer architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution(OOD) detection, a fundamental machine learning task aimed at identifying abnormal samples, traditionally requires model retraining for different inlier distributions. While recent research demonstrates the applicability of diffusion models to OOD detection, existing approaches are limited to Euclidean or latent image spaces. Our work extends OOD detection to trajectories in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D ($\mathbb{SE}(3)$), addressing a critical need in computer vision, robotics, and engineering applications that process object pose sequences in $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We present $\textbf{D}$iffusion-based $\textbf{O}$ut-of-distribution detection on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ ($\mathbf{DOSE3}$), a novel OOD framework that extends diffusion to a unified sample space of $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ pose sequences. Through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate $\mathbf{DOSE3}$'s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Nakatani (Security & Development Lab)</p>
<p>Abstract: We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses
  the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior
  approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen
  leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from
  a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented
  knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop
  (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted
  exploits in a fully automated manner.
  In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell
  access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a
  60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential
  of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations
  without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities,
  while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges.
  Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient,
  thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is transforming clinical decision-making and hospital operations. DeepSeek has emerged as a leading AI system, widely deployed across China's tertiary hospitals since January 2025. Initially implemented in Shanghai's major medical institutions, it has since expanded nationwide, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, streamlining workflows, and improving patient management. AI-powered pathology, imaging analysis, and clinical decision support systems have demonstrated significant potential in optimizing medical processes and reducing the cognitive burden on healthcare professionals. However, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare raises critical regulatory and ethical challenges, particularly regarding accountability in AI-assisted diagnosis and the risk of automation bias. The absence of a well-defined liability framework underscores the need for policies that ensure AI functions as an assistive tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker. With continued technological advancements, AI is expected to integrate multimodal data sources, such as genomics and radiomics, paving the way for precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies. The future of AI in healthcare depends on the development of transparent regulatory structures, industry collaboration, and adaptive governance frameworks that balance innovation with responsibility, ensuring equitable and effective AI-driven medical services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Peng Gao, Yu Shen, Ming Lin, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge transfer between teacher and student models has proven effective across various machine learning applications. However, challenges arise when the teacher's predictions are noisy, or the data domain during student training shifts from the teacher's pretraining data. In such scenarios, blindly relying on the teacher's predictions can lead to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and universal framework, Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Knowledge Transfer ($\textbf{AUKT}$), which leverages Conformal Prediction (CP) to dynamically adjust the student's reliance on the teacher's guidance based on the teacher's prediction uncertainty. CP is a distribution-free, model-agnostic approach that provides reliable prediction sets with statistical coverage guarantees and minimal computational overhead. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the risk of learning undesirable or incorrect knowledge. We validate the proposed framework across diverse applications, including image classification, imitation-guided reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach improves performance, robustness and transferability, offering a promising direction for enhanced knowledge transfer in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Lu, Mohammad Pedramfar, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Projection-based algorithms for constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) face scalability challenges in high-dimensional settings due to the computational complexity of projecting iterates onto constraint sets. This paper introduces a projection-free algorithm for COCO that achieves state-of-the-art performance guarantees while eliminating the need for projections. By integrating a separation oracle with adaptive Online Gradient Descent (OGD) and employing a Lyapunov-driven surrogate function, while dynamically adjusting step sizes using gradient norms, our method jointly optimizes the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV). We also use a blocked version of OGD that helps achieve tradeoffs betweeen the regret and CCV with the number of calls to the separation oracle. For convex cost functions, our algorithm attains an optimal regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a CCV of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log T)$, matching the best-known projection-based results, while only using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({T})$ calls to the separation oracle. The results also demonstrate a tradeoff where lower calls to the separation oracle increase the regret and the CCV. In the strongly convex setting, we further achieve a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ and a CCV of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log T} )$, while requiring ${\mathcal{O}}({T}^2)$ calls to the separation oracle. Further, tradeoff with the decreasing oracle calls is studied. These results close the gap between projection-free and projection-based approaches, demonstrating that projection-free methods can achieve performance comparable to projection-based counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Quoc Nguyen, Cong Duy Vu Hoang, Duy Vu, Gioacchino Tangari, Thanh Tien Vu, Don Dharmasiri, Yuan-Fang Li, Long Duong</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance in the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task. However, their effectiveness diminishes when dealing with large database schemas, as the context length increases. To address this limitation, we present SQLong, a novel and efficient data augmentation framework designed to enhance LLM performance in long-context scenarios for the NL2SQL task. SQLong generates augmented datasets by extending existing database schemas with additional synthetic CREATE TABLE commands and corresponding data rows, sampled from diverse schemas in the training data. This approach effectively simulates long-context scenarios during finetuning and evaluation. Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets. These imply SQLong's practical implementation and its impact on improving NL2SQL capabilities in real-world settings with complex database schemas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Ma, Dongrui Liu, Qian Chen, Linfeng Zhang, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized tasks incurs substantial computational and data costs. While model merging offers a training-free solution to integrate multiple task-specific models, existing methods suffer from safety-utility conflicts where enhanced general capabilities degrade safety safeguards. We identify two root causes: \textbf{neuron misidentification} due to simplistic parameter magnitude-based selection, and \textbf{cross-task neuron interference} during merging. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LED-Merging}, a three-stage framework that \textbf{L}ocates task-specific neurons via gradient-based attribution, dynamically \textbf{E}lects critical neurons through multi-model importance fusion, and \textbf{D}isjoints conflicting updates through parameter isolation. Extensive experiments on Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-13B demonstrate that LED-Merging reduces harmful response rates(\emph{e.g.}, a 31.4\% decrease on Llama-3-8B-Instruct on HarmBench) while preserving 95\% of utility performance(\emph{e.g.}, 52.39\% accuracy on GSM8K). LED-Merging resolves safety-utility conflicts and provides a lightweight, training-free paradigm for constructing reliable multi-task LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanaz Hasanzadeh Fard, Emily Dolson</p>
<p>Abstract: Species interaction networks are a powerful tool for describing ecological communities; they typically contain nodes representing species, and edges representing interactions between those species. For the purposes of drawing abstract inferences about groups of similar networks, ecologists often use graph topology metrics to summarize structural features. However, gathering the data that underlies these networks is challenging, which can lead to some interactions being missed. Thus, it is important to understand how much different structural metrics are affected by missing data. To address this question, we analyzed a database of 148 real-world bipartite networks representing four different types of species interactions (pollination, host-parasite, plant-ant, and seed-dispersal). For each network, we measured six different topological properties: number of connected components, variance in node betweenness, variance in node PageRank, largest Eigenvalue, the number of non-zero Eigenvalues, and community detection as determined by four different algorithms. We then tested how these properties change as additional edges -- representing data that may have been missed -- are added to the networks. We found substantial variation in how robust different properties were to the missing data. For example, the Clauset-Newman-Moore and Louvain community detection algorithms showed much more gradual change as edges were added than the label propagation and Girvan-Newman algorithms did, suggesting that the former are more robust. Robustness also varied for some metrics based on interaction type. These results provide a foundation for selecting network properties to use when analyzing messy ecological network data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxuan Huang, Xili Dai, Jianan Wang, Xianbiao Qi, Yixing Yuan, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Room layout estimation from multiple-perspective images is poorly investigated due to the complexities that emerge from multi-view geometry, which requires muti-step solutions such as camera intrinsic and extrinsic estimation, image matching, and triangulation. However, in 3D reconstruction, the advancement of recent 3D foundation models such as DUSt3R has shifted the paradigm from the traditional multi-step structure-from-motion process to an end-to-end single-step approach. To this end, we introduce Plane-DUSt3R}, a novel method for multi-view room layout estimation leveraging the 3D foundation model DUSt3R. Plane-DUSt3R incorporates the DUSt3R framework and fine-tunes on a room layout dataset (Structure3D) with a modified objective to estimate structural planes. By generating uniform and parsimonious results, Plane-DUSt3R enables room layout estimation with only a single post-processing step and 2D detection results. Unlike previous methods that rely on single-perspective or panorama image, Plane-DUSt3R extends the setting to handle multiple-perspective images. Moreover, it offers a streamlined, end-to-end solution that simplifies the process and reduces error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that Plane-DUSt3R not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the synthetic dataset but also proves robust and effective on in the wild data with different image styles such as cartoon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Tang, Zechuan Chen, Jiarui Yang, Jiayao Mai, Yongsen Zheng, Keze Wang, Jinrui Chen, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on discovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex financial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Golowich, Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, Sham M. Kakade, Eran Malach</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models to predict beyond their training context lengths has drawn much attention in recent years, yet the principles driving such behavior of length generalization remain underexplored. We propose a new theoretical framework to study length generalization for the next-token prediction task, as performed by decoder-only transformers. Conceptually, we show that length generalization occurs as long as each predicted token depends on a small (fixed) number of previous tokens. We formalize such tasks via a notion we call $k$-sparse planted correlation distributions, and show that an idealized model of transformers which generalize attention heads successfully length-generalize on such tasks. As a bonus, our theoretical model justifies certain techniques to modify positional embeddings which have been introduced to improve length generalization, such as position coupling.
  We support our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic tasks and natural language, which confirm that a key factor driving length generalization is a ``sparse'' dependency structure of each token on the previous ones. Inspired by our theory, we introduce Predictive Position Coupling, which trains the transformer to predict the position IDs used in a positional coupling approach. Predictive Position Coupling thereby allows us to broaden the array of tasks to which position coupling can successfully be applied to achieve length generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Bin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their ability to learn representations from graph data. Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client nodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing attacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain gradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation precludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address the above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL, referred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the local clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a contrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are trained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature information of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by node-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then, VGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and the gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive function. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification rules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node classification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA achieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

<p>Abstract: Mobile phone agents can assist people in automating daily tasks on their phones, which have emerged as a pivotal research spotlight. However, existing procedure-oriented agents struggle with cross-app instructions, due to the following challenges: (1) complex task relationships, (2) diverse app environment, and (3) error propagation and information loss in multi-step execution. Drawing inspiration from object-oriented programming principles, we recognize that object-oriented solutions is more suitable for cross-app instruction. To address these challenges, we propose a self-evolving multi-agent framework named MobileSteward, which integrates multiple app-oriented StaffAgents coordinated by a centralized StewardAgent. We design three specialized modules in MobileSteward: (1) Dynamic Recruitment generates a scheduling graph guided by information flow to explicitly associate tasks among apps. (2) Assigned Execution assigns the task to app-oriented StaffAgents, each equipped with app-specialized expertise to address the diversity between apps. (3) Adjusted Evaluation conducts evaluation to provide reflection tips or deliver key information, which alleviates error propagation and information loss during multi-step execution. To continuously improve the performance of MobileSteward, we develop a Memory-based Self-evolution mechanism, which summarizes the experience from successful execution, to improve the performance of MobileSteward. We establish the first English Cross-APP Benchmark (CAPBench) in the real-world environment to evaluate the agents' capabilities of solving complex cross-app instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that MobileSteward achieves the best performance compared to both single-agent and multi-agent frameworks, highlighting the superiority of MobileSteward in better handling user instructions with diverse complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Peng, Xinlin Zhuang, Qiu Jiantao, Ren Ma, Jing Yu, Tianyi Bai, Conghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly affected by the quality and composition of their pre-training data, which is inherently diverse, spanning various domains, sources, and topics. Effectively integrating these heterogeneous data sources is crucial for optimizing LLM performance. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on domain-based data mixing, often neglecting the nuanced topic-level characteristics of the data. To address this gap, we propose a simple yet effective topic-based data mixing strategy that utilizes fine-grained topics generated through our topic modeling method, DataWeave. DataWeave employs a multi-stage clustering process to group semantically similar documents and utilizes LLMs to generate detailed topics, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of dataset composition. Our strategy employs heuristic methods to upsample or downsample specific topics, which significantly enhances LLM performance on downstream tasks, achieving superior results compared to previous, more complex data mixing approaches. Furthermore, we confirm that the topics Science and Relationships are particularly effective, yielding the most substantial performance improvements. We will make our code and datasets publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are revolutionizing transportation by reducing human intervention, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing safety. Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their exceptional planning and reasoning capabilities, have been integrated into ADSs to assist with driving decision-making. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advancements in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs have focused on improving inter-agent communication and cooperation. This paper provides a frontier survey of LLM-based multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based approaches based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans.

<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking under low-light environments is prevalent in real life. Recent years have seen rapid development in the field of multi-object tracking. However, due to the lack of datasets and the high cost of annotations, multi-object tracking under low-light environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking under low-light conditions. To address the issues of limited data and the lack of dataset, we first constructed a low-light multi-object tracking dataset (LLMOT). This dataset comprises data from MOT17 that has been enhanced for nighttime conditions as well as multiple unannotated low-light videos. Subsequently, to tackle the high annotation costs and address the issue of image quality degradation, we propose a semi-supervised multi-object tracking method based on consistency regularization named CRTrack. First, we calibrate a consistent adaptive sampling assignment to replace the static IoU-based strategy, enabling the semi-supervised tracking method to resist noisy pseudo-bounding boxes. Then, we design a adaptive semi-supervised network update method, which effectively leverages unannotated data to enhance model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Guo, Yuren Mao, Zhonghao Hu, Lu Chen, Yunjun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic join discovery, which aims to find columns in a table repository with high semantic joinabilities to a query column, is crucial for dataset discovery. Existing methods can be divided into two categories: cell-level methods and column-level methods. However, neither of them ensures both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Cell-level methods, which compute the joinability by counting cell matches between columns, enjoy ideal effectiveness but suffer poor efficiency. In contrast, column-level methods, which determine joinability only by computing the similarity of column embeddings, enjoy proper efficiency but suffer poor effectiveness due to the issues occurring in their column embeddings: (i) semantics-joinability-gap, (ii) size limit, and (iii) permutation sensitivity. To address these issues, this paper proposes to compute column embeddings via proxy columns; furthermore, a novel column-level semantic join discovery framework, Snoopy, is presented, leveraging proxy-column-based embeddings to bridge effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, the proposed column embeddings are derived from the implicit column-to-proxy-column relationships, which are captured by the lightweight approximate-graph-matching-based column projection.To acquire good proxy columns for guiding the column projection, we introduce a rank-aware contrastive learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Snoopy outperforms SOTA column-level methods by 16% in Recall@25 and 10% in NDCG@25, and achieves superior efficiency--being at least 5 orders of magnitude faster than cell-level solutions, and 3.5x faster than existing column-level methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks due to large training datasets and powerful transformer architecture. However, the reliability of responses from LLMs remains a question. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs is crucial for ensuring their reliability, especially in areas such as healthcare, finance, and decision-making. Existing UQ methods primarily focus on semantic similarity, overlooking the deeper knowledge dimensions embedded in responses. We introduce a multi-dimensional UQ framework that integrates semantic and knowledge-aware similarity analysis. By generating multiple responses and leveraging auxiliary LLMs to extract implicit knowledge, we construct separate similarity matrices and apply tensor decomposition to derive a comprehensive uncertainty representation. This approach disentangles overlapping information from both semantic and knowledge dimensions, capturing both semantic variations and factual consistency, leading to more accurate UQ. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in identifying uncertain responses, offering a more robust framework for enhancing LLM reliability in high-stakes applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruikun Li, Huandong Wang, Qingmin Liao, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy landscapes play a crucial role in shaping dynamics of many real-world complex systems. System evolution is often modeled as particles moving on a landscape under the combined effect of energy-driven drift and noise-induced diffusion, where the energy governs the long-term motion of the particles. Estimating the energy landscape of a system has been a longstanding interdisciplinary challenge, hindered by the high operational costs or the difficulty of obtaining supervisory signals. Therefore, the question of how to infer the energy landscape in the absence of true energy values is critical. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed self-supervised learning method to learn the energy landscape from the evolution trajectories of the system. It first maps the system state from the observation space to a discrete landscape space by an adaptive codebook, and then explicitly integrates energy into the graph neural Fokker-Planck equation, enabling the joint learning of energy estimation and evolution prediction. Experimental results across interdisciplinary systems demonstrate that our estimated energy has a correlation coefficient above 0.9 with the ground truth, and evolution prediction accuracy exceeds the baseline by an average of 17.65\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houji Jin, Negin Ashrafi, Kamiar Alaei, Elham Pishgar, Greg Placencia, Maryam Pishgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis is a major cause of ICU mortality, where early recognition and effective interventions are essential for improving patient outcomes. However, the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) varies dynamically with a patient's hemodynamic status, complicated by irregular medication patterns, missing data, and confounders, making sepsis prediction challenging. To address this, we propose a novel Teacher-Student multitask framework with self-supervised VIS pretraining via a Masked Autoencoder (MAE). The teacher model performs mortality classification and severity-score regression, while the student distills robust time-series representations, enhancing adaptation to heterogeneous VIS data. Compared to LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an AUROC of 0.82 on MIMIC-IV 3.0 (9,476 patients), outperforming the baseline (0.74). SHAP analysis revealed that SOFA score (0.147) had the greatest impact on ICU mortality, followed by LODS (0.033), single marital status (0.031), and Medicaid insurance (0.023), highlighting the role of sociodemographic factors. SAPSII (0.020) also contributed significantly. These findings suggest that both clinical and social factors should be considered in ICU decision-making. Our novel multitask and distillation strategies enable earlier identification of high-risk patients, improving prediction accuracy and disease management, offering new tools for ICU decision support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afonso Louren\c{c}o, Jo\~ao Gama, Eric P. Xing, Goreti Marreiros</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art data stream mining in supervised classification has traditionally relied on ensembles of incremental decision trees. However, the emergence of large tabular models, i.e., transformers designed for structured numerical data, marks a significant paradigm shift. These models move beyond traditional weight updates, instead employing in-context learning through prompt tuning. By using on-the-fly sketches to summarize unbounded streaming data, one can feed this information into a pre-trained model for efficient processing. This work bridges advancements from both areas, highlighting how transformers' implicit meta-learning abilities, pre-training on drifting natural data, and reliance on context optimization directly address the core challenges of adaptive learning in dynamic environments. Exploring real-time model adaptation, this research demonstrates that TabPFN, coupled with a simple sliding memory strategy, consistently outperforms ensembles of Hoeffding trees across all non-stationary benchmarks. Several promising research directions are outlined in the paper. The authors urge the community to explore these ideas, offering valuable opportunities to advance in-context stream learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dilermando Queiroz, Anderson Carlos, Andr\'e Anjos, Lilian Berton</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring equitable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare demands systems that make unbiased decisions across all demographic groups, bridging technical innovation with ethical principles. Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahsa Golchoubian, Moojan Ghafurian, Nasser Lashgarian Azad, Kerstin Dautenhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zhang, Dian Yu, Tao Ge, Linfeng Song, Zhichen Zeng, Haitao Mi, Nan Jiang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Many existing alignment approaches rely on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which assumes the existence of a ground-truth reward for each prompt-response pair. However, this assumption can be overly restrictive when modeling complex human preferences. In this paper, we drop the BT model assumption and study LLM alignment under general preferences, formulated as a two-player game. Drawing on theoretical insights from learning in games, we integrate optimistic online mirror descent into our alignment framework to approximate the Nash policy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an $O(T^{-1})$ bound on the duality gap, improving upon the previous $O(T^{-1/2})$ result. More importantly, we implement our method and show through experiments that it outperforms state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms across multiple representative benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an effective approach to detect AI-generated text, developed for the Defactify 4.0 shared task at the fourth workshop on multimodal fact checking and hate speech detection. The task consists of two subtasks: Task-A, classifying whether a text is AI generated or human written, and Task-B, classifying the specific large language model that generated the text. Our team (Sarang) achieved the 1st place in both tasks with F1 scores of 1.0 and 0.9531, respectively. The methodology involves adding noise to the dataset to improve model robustness and generalization. We used an ensemble of DeBERTa models to effectively capture complex patterns in the text. The result indicates the effectiveness of our noise-driven and ensemble-based approach, setting a new standard in AI-generated text detection and providing guidance for future developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruichen Zhang, Shunpu Tang, Yinqiu Liu, Dusit Niyato, Zehui Xiong, Sumei Sun, Shiwen Mao, Zhu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of modern telecommunications networks demand intelligent automation to enhance efficiency, adaptability, and resilience. Agentic AI has emerged as a key paradigm for intelligent communications and networking, enabling AI-driven agents to perceive, reason, decide, and act within dynamic networking environments. However, effective decision-making in telecom applications, such as network planning, management, and resource allocation, requires integrating retrieval mechanisms that support multi-hop reasoning, historical cross-referencing, and compliance with evolving 3GPP standards. This article presents a forward-looking perspective on generative information retrieval-inspired intelligent communications and networking, emphasizing the role of knowledge acquisition, processing, and retrieval in agentic AI for telecom systems. We first provide a comprehensive review of generative information retrieval strategies, including traditional retrieval, hybrid retrieval, semantic retrieval, knowledge-based retrieval, and agentic contextual retrieval. We then analyze their advantages, limitations, and suitability for various networking scenarios. Next, we present a survey about their applications in communications and networking. Additionally, we introduce an agentic contextual retrieval framework to enhance telecom-specific planning by integrating multi-source retrieval, structured reasoning, and self-reflective validation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves answer accuracy, explanation consistency, and retrieval efficiency compared to traditional and semantic retrieval methods. Finally, we outline future research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and autonomous AI agent workflows. Yet, when faced with large sets of unstructured documents requiring progressive exploration, analysis, and synthesis, such as conducting literature survey, existing approaches often fall short. We address this challenge -- termed Progressive Document Investigation -- by introducing Graphy, an end-to-end platform that automates data modeling, exploration and high-quality report generation in a user-friendly manner. Graphy comprises an offline Scrapper that transforms raw documents into a structured graph of Fact and Dimension nodes, and an online Surveyor that enables iterative exploration and LLM-driven report generation. We showcase a pre-scrapped graph of over 50,000 papers -- complete with their references -- demonstrating how Graphy facilitates the literature-survey scenario.

<p>Abstract: Saudi Arabia faced a swift economic growth and societal transformation under Vision 2030. This offers a unique opportunity to track emerging trends in the region, which will ultimately pave the way for new business and investment possibilities. This paper explores how AI and social media analytics can identify and track trends across sectors such as construction, food and beverage, tourism, technology, and entertainment thereby helping the businesses make informed decisions. By leveraging a tailored AI-driven methodology, we analyzed millions of social media posts each month, classifying discussions and calculating scores to track the trends. The approach not only uncovered the emerging trends but also shows diminishing trends. Our methodology is able to predict the emergence and growth of trends by utilizing social media data. This approach has potential for adaptation in other regions. Ultimately, our findings highlight how ongoing, AI-powered trend analysis can enable more effective, data-informed business and development strategies in an increasingly dynamic environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yepeng Weng, Dianwen Mei, Huishi Qiu, Xujie Chen, Li Liu, Jiang Tian, Zhongchao Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. However, these techniques often require a pre-defined cache budget; as the optimal budget varies with different input lengths and task types, it limits their practical deployment accepting open-domain instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqi Yu, Yaoming Li, Juncheng Wang, Xiaoyu Guo, Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero, Tong Yang, Shujun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have progressively incorporated frequency-based techniques into deep learning models, leading to notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for time series analysis tasks. However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaheng Li, Donghe Li, Ye Yang, Huan Xi, Yu Xiao, Li Sun, Dou An, Qingyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems has increased the complexity and uncertainty of load forecasting, especially for integrated energy systems with multiple energy carriers. Traditional forecasting methods heavily rely on historical data and exhibit limited transferability across different scenarios, posing significant challenges for emerging applications in smart grids and energy internet. This paper proposes the TSLLM-Load Forecasting Mechanism, a novel zero-shot load forecasting framework based on large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. The framework consists of three key components: a data preprocessing module that handles multi-source energy load data, a time series prompt generation module that bridges the semantic gap between energy data and LLMs through multi-task learning and similarity alignment, and a prediction module that leverages pre-trained LLMs for accurate forecasting. The framework's effectiveness was validated on a real-world dataset comprising load profiles from 20 Australian solar-powered households, demonstrating superior performance in both conventional and zero-shot scenarios. In conventional testing, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4163 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3760, outperforming existing approaches by at least 8\%. In zero-shot prediction experiments across 19 households, the framework maintained consistent accuracy with a total MSE of 11.2712 and MAE of 7.6709, showing at least 12\% improvement over current methods. The results validate the framework's potential for accurate and transferable load forecasting in integrated energy systems, particularly beneficial for renewable energy integration and smart grid applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image models, including Stable Diffusion, have significantly improved in generating images that are highly semantically aligned with the given prompts. However, existing models may fail to produce appropriate images for the cultural concepts or objects that are not well known or underrepresented in western cultures, such as `hangari' (Korean utensil). In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Culturally-Aware Text-to-Image Generation with Iterative Prompt Refinement (Culture-TRIP), which refines the prompt in order to improve the alignment of the image with such culture nouns in text-to-image models. Our approach (1) retrieves cultural contexts and visual details related to the culture nouns in the prompt and (2) iteratively refines and evaluates the prompt based on a set of cultural criteria and large language models. The refinement process utilizes the information retrieved from Wikipedia and the Web. Our user survey, conducted with 66 participants from eight different countries demonstrates that our proposed approach enhances the alignment between the images and the prompts. In particular, C-TRIP demonstrates improved alignment between the generated images and underrepresented culture nouns. Resource can be found at https://shane3606.github.io/Culture-TRIP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scene flow estimation aims to predict 3D motion from consecutive point cloud frames, which is of great interest in autonomous driving field. Existing methods face challenges such as insufficient spatio-temporal modeling and inherent loss of fine-grained feature during voxelization. However, the success of Mamba, a representative state space model (SSM) that enables global modeling with linear complexity, provides a promising solution. In this paper, we propose MambaFlow, a novel scene flow estimation network with a mamba-based decoder. It enables deep interaction and coupling of spatio-temporal features using a well-designed backbone. Innovatively, we steer the global attention modeling of voxel-based features with point offset information using an efficient Mamba-based decoder, learning voxel-to-point patterns that are used to devoxelize shared voxel representations into point-wise features. To further enhance the model's generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios, we propose a novel scene-adaptive loss function that automatically adapts to different motion patterns.Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that MambaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed among existing works, enabling accurate flow estimation in real-world urban scenarios.

<p>Abstract: The weighted low-rank approximation problem is a fundamental numerical linear algebra problem and has many applications in machine learning. Given a $n \times n$ weight matrix $W$ and a $n \times n$ matrix $A$, the goal is to find two low-rank matrices $U, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ such that the cost of $\| W \circ (U V^\top - A) \|_F^2$ is minimized. Previous work has to pay $\Omega(n^2)$ time when matrices $A$ and $W$ are dense, e.g., having $\Omega(n^2)$ non-zero entries. In this work, we show that there is a certain regime, even if $A$ and $W$ are dense, we can still hope to solve the weighted low-rank approximation problem in almost linear $n^{1+o(1)}$ time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Jin, Shengnan Wang, Jiaan Zhu, Hongrui Zhan, Youhui Bai, Lin Zhang, Zhenyu Ming, Cheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear increase in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE structure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of MoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication introduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained structure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence contributing to heavier communication overhead.
  In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also fine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac is mainly due to that we abandon the \textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{d}escend-\textbf{a}scend-\textbf{c}ommunicate (CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All communication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac designs an efficient \textbf{d}escend-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{a}scend (DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at the entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the communication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to DCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in BigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that BigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs with the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters. Equally importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 3.09$\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\times$ for inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron, Tutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joan Serr\`a, R. Oguz Araz, Dmitry Bogdanov, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting musical versions (different renditions of the same piece) is a challenging task with important applications. Because of the ground truth nature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g., whole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment level (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to classification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could bring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from weakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that outperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment distance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following decoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two elements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard track-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a segment-level evaluation. We believe that, due to the generality of the challenges addressed here, the proposed methods may find utility in domains beyond audio or musical version matching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiachong Feng, Longxu Dou, Lingpeng Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of role-playing large language models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding in both academic and commercial domains, driving an increasing demand for high-precision role-playing models. Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of reasoning techniques has continuously pushed the performance boundaries of LLMs. This intersection of practical role-playing demands and evolving reasoning capabilities raises an important research question: "Can reasoning techniques enhance the role-playing capabilities of LLMs?" To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study using 6 role-playing benchmarks, 24 LLMs, and 3 distinct role-playing strategies, comparing the effectiveness of direct zero-shot role-playing, role-playing with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and role-playing using reasoning-optimized LLMs. Our findings reveal that CoT may reduce role-playing performance, reasoning-optimized LLMs are unsuitable for role-playing, reasoning ability disrupts the role-playing scaling law, large models still lack proficiency in advanced role-playing, and Chinese role-playing performance surpasses English role-playing performance. Furthermore, based on extensive experimental results, we propose two promising future research directions: Role-aware CoT for improving role-playing LLMs and Reinforcement Learning for role-playing LLMs, aiming to enhance the adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness of role-playing LLMs for both research and real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghua Huang, Lu Wang, Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Zhixu Li, Qingwei Lin, Dongmei Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. It requires joint training of an actor and critic with a pretrained, fixed reward model for guidance. This approach increases computational complexity and instability due to actor-critic interdependence. Additionally, PPO lacks access to true environment rewards in LLM tasks, limiting its adaptability. Under such conditions, pretraining a value model or a reward model becomes equivalent, as both provide fixed supervisory signals without new ground-truth feedback. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Decoupled Value Policy Optimization (DVPO)}, a lean framework that replaces traditional reward modeling with a pretrained \emph{global value model (GVM)}. The GVM is conditioned on policy trajectories and predicts token-level return-to-go estimates. By decoupling value model from policy training (via frozen GVM-driven RL objectives), DVPO eliminates actor-critic interdependence, reducing GPU memory usage by 40\% and training time by 35\% compared to conventional RLHF. Experiments across benchmarks show DVPO outperforms efficient RLHF methods (e.g., DPO) while matching state-of-the-art PPO in performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide suboptimal performance on low-resource languages like Urdu. This paper introduces UrduLLaMA 1.0, a model derived from the open-source Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct architecture and continually pre-trained on 128 million Urdu tokens, capturing the rich diversity of the language. To enhance instruction-following and translation capabilities, we leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine tune the model on 41,000 Urdu instructions and approximately 50,000 English-Urdu translation pairs. Evaluation across three machine translation datasets demonstrates significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, establishing a new benchmark for Urdu LLMs. These findings underscore the potential of targeted adaptation strategies with limited data and computational resources to address the unique challenges of low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yida Lu, Jiale Cheng, Zhexin Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in understanding and generating long sequences, new safety concerns have been introduced through the long context. However, the safety of LLMs in long-context tasks remains under-explored, leaving a significant gap in both evaluation and improvement of their safety. To address this, we introduce LongSafety, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM safety in open-ended long-context tasks. LongSafety encompasses 7 categories of safety issues and 6 user-oriented long-context tasks, with a total of 1,543 test cases, averaging 5,424 words per context. Our evaluation towards 16 representative LLMs reveals significant safety vulnerabilities, with most models achieving safety rates below 55%. Our findings also indicate that strong safety performance in short-context scenarios does not necessarily correlate with safety in long-context tasks, emphasizing the unique challenges and urgency of improving long-context safety. Moreover, through extensive analysis, we identify challenging safety issues and task types for long-context models. Furthermore, we find that relevant context and extended input sequences can exacerbate safety risks in long-context scenarios, highlighting the critical need for ongoing attention to long-context safety challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> L\'eo Dana (SIERRA), Francis Bach (SIERRA), Loucas Pillaud-Vivien (ENPC, CERMICS)</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyse the convergence of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks trained by gradient flow on $n$ data points. Our main contribution leverages the high dimensionality of the ambient space, which implies low correlation of the input samples, to demonstrate that a network with width of order $\log(n)$ neurons suffices for global convergence with high probability. Our analysis uses a Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz viewpoint along the gradient-flow trajectory, which provides an exponential rate of convergence of $\frac{1}{n}$. When the data are exactly orthogonal, we give further refined characterizations of the convergence speed, proving its asymptotic behavior lies between the orders $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, and exhibiting a phase-transition phenomenon in the convergence rate, during which it evolves from the lower bound to the upper, and in a relative time of order $\frac{1}{\log(n)}$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the Muon optimizer based on matrix orthogonalization has demonstrated strong results in training small-scale language models, but the scalability to larger models has not been proven. We identify two crucial techniques for scaling up Muon: (1) adding weight decay and (2) carefully adjusting the per-parameter update scale. These techniques allow Muon to work out-of-the-box on large-scale training without the need of hyper-parameter tuning. Scaling law experiments indicate that Muon achieves $\sim\!2\times$ computational efficiency compared to AdamW with compute optimal training.
  Based on these improvements, we introduce Moonlight, a 3B/16B-parameter Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model trained with 5.7T tokens using Muon. Our model improves the current Pareto frontier, achieving better performance with much fewer training FLOPs compared to prior models.
  We open-source our distributed Muon implementation that is memory optimal and communication efficient. We also release the pretrained, instruction-tuned, and intermediate checkpoints to support future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents Hotter and Colder, a dataset designed to analyze various types of online behavior in Icelandic blog comments.

Each comment was automatically labeled on a 5-point Likert scale. In a second annotation stage, comments with high or low probabilities of containing each examined behavior were subjected to manual revision. By leveraging crowdworkers to refine these automatically labeled comments, we ensure the quality and accuracy of our dataset resulting in 12,232 uniquely annotated comments and 19,301 annotations. Hotter and Colder provides an essential resource for advancing research in content moderation and automatically detectiong harmful online behaviors in Icelandic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have highlighted the potential of automating interpretability pipelines in analyzing the latent representations within LLMs. While they may enhance our understanding of internal mechanisms, the field lacks standardized evaluation methods for assessing the validity of discovered features. We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for evaluating feature-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes for the misalignment of feature and their description. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions, and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs as compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Wu, Zheng Liu, Yong Chen, Chao Su, Dezhong Peng, Xu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deep neural networks has brought increased attention to the security and robustness of these models. While existing adversarial attack algorithms have demonstrated success in improving adversarial transferability, their performance remains suboptimal due to a lack of consideration for the discrepancies between target and source models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method, Inverse Knowledge Distillation (IKD), designed to enhance adversarial transferability effectively. IKD introduces a distillation-inspired loss function that seamlessly integrates with gradient-based attack methods, promoting diversity in attack gradients and mitigating overfitting to specific model architectures. By diversifying gradients, IKD enables the generation of adversarial samples with superior generalization capabilities across different models, significantly enhancing their effectiveness in black-box attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in the transferability and attack success rates of adversarial samples across a wide range of models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This position paper argues that, to its detriment, transparency research overlooks many foundational concepts of artificial intelligence. Here, we focus on uncertainty quantification -- in the context of ante-hoc interpretability and counterfactual explainability -- showing how its adoption could address key challenges in the field. First, we posit that uncertainty and ante-hoc interpretability offer complementary views of the same underlying idea; second, we assert that uncertainty provides a principled unifying framework for counterfactual explainability. Consequently, inherently transparent models can benefit from human-centred explanatory insights -- like counterfactuals -- which are otherwise missing. At a higher level, integrating artificial intelligence fundamentals into transparency research promises to yield more reliable, robust and understandable predictive models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale physical systems defined on irregular grids pose significant scalability challenges for deep learning methods, especially in the presence of long-range interactions and multi-scale coupling. Traditional approaches that compute all pairwise interactions, such as attention, become computationally prohibitive as they scale quadratically with the number of nodes. We present Erwin, a hierarchical transformer inspired by methods from computational many-body physics, which combines the efficiency of tree-based algorithms with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Erwin employs ball tree partitioning to organize computation, which enables linear-time attention by processing nodes in parallel within local neighborhoods of fixed size. Through progressive coarsening and refinement of the ball tree structure, complemented by a novel cross-ball interaction mechanism, it captures both fine-grained local details and global features. We demonstrate Erwin's effectiveness across multiple domains, including cosmology, molecular dynamics, and particle fluid dynamics, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods both in accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Miller, Tristram Alexander</p>
<p>Abstract: Cluster number is typically a parameter selected at the outset in clustering problems, and while impactful, the choice can often be difficult to justify. Inspired by bioinformatics, this study examines how the nature of clusters varies with cluster number, presenting a method for determining cluster robustness, and providing a systematic method for deciding on the cluster number. The study focuses specifically on short-text clustering, involving 30,000 political Twitter bios, where the sparse co-occurrence of words between texts makes finding meaningful clusters challenging. A metric of proportional stability is introduced to uncover the stability of specific clusters between cluster resolutions, and the results are visualised using Sankey diagrams to provide an interrogative tool for understanding the nature of the dataset. The visualisation provides an intuitive way to track cluster subdivision and reorganisation as cluster number increases, offering insights that static, single-resolution metrics cannot capture. The results show that instead of seeking a single 'optimal' solution, choosing a cluster number involves balancing informativeness and complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregor Baer, Isel Grau, Chao Zhang, Pieter Van Gorp</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contributed the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we identify important class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longchao Da, Xiaoou Liu, Jiaxin Dai, Lu Cheng, Yaqing Wang, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the uncertainty in large language model (LLM) explanations is important for evaluating their faithfulness and reasoning consistency, and thus provides insights into the reliability of LLM's output regarding a question. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal alignment is crucial for various downstream tasks such as cross-modal generation and retrieval. Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP maximize the mutual information mainly by aligning pairwise samples across modalities while overlooking the distributional differences, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. In this paper, to overcome the limitation, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel and straightforward framework that performs distributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence with mutual information. In the proposed framework, we find that the CS divergence and mutual information serve complementary roles in multimodal alignment, capturing both the global distribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic relationships, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, CS-Aligher enables incorporating additional information from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing flexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image generation and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on vision-language alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) re-rankers are used to refine retrieval results for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). They are more expensive than lexical matching methods like BM25 but assumed to better process semantic information. To understand whether LM re-rankers always live up to this assumption, we evaluate 6 different LM re-rankers on the NQ, LitQA2 and DRUID datasets. Our results show that LM re-rankers struggle to outperform a simple BM25 re-ranker on DRUID. Leveraging a novel separation metric based on BM25 scores, we explain and identify re-ranker errors stemming from lexical dissimilarities. We also investigate different methods to improve LM re-ranker performance and find these methods mainly useful for NQ. Taken together, our work identifies and explains weaknesses of LM re-rankers and points to the need for more adversarial and realistic datasets for their evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjin Huang, Haotian Hu, Zhenyu Zhang, Gaojie Jin, Xiang Li, Li Shen, Tianlong Chen, Lu Liu, Qingsong Wen, Zhangyang Wang, Shiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical $l_2$-norm statistics; and $(3)$ inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to $2$ perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps.

<p>Abstract: Query expansion plays a crucial role in information retrieval, which aims to bridge the semantic gap between queries and documents to improve matching performance. This paper introduces LLM-QE, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate document-based query expansions, thereby enhancing dense retrieval models. Unlike traditional methods, LLM-QE designs both rank-based and answer-based rewards and uses these reward models to optimize LLMs to align with the ranking preferences of both retrievers and LLMs, thus mitigating the hallucination of LLMs during query expansion. Our experiments on the zero-shot dense retrieval model, Contriever, demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-QE, achieving an improvement of over 8%. Furthermore, by incorporating answer-based reward modeling, LLM-QE generates more relevant and precise information related to the documents, rather than simply producing redundant tokens to maximize rank-based rewards. Notably, LLM-QE also improves the training process of dense retrievers, achieving a more than 5% improvement after fine-tuning. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/LLM-QE.</p>

<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has revolutionized artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing. However, the extensive computational resources required for training these models have significant environmental implications, including high carbon emissions, energy consumption, and water usage. This research presents a novel approach to LLM pruning, focusing on the systematic evaluation of individual weight importance throughout the training process. By monitoring parameter evolution over time, we propose a method that effectively reduces model size without compromising performance. Extensive experiments with both a scaled-down LLM and a large multimodal model reveal that moderate pruning enhances efficiency and reduces loss, while excessive pruning drastically deteriorates model performance. These findings highlight the critical need for optimized AI models to ensure sustainable development, balancing technological advancement with environmental responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linian Wang, Leye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy concerns in machine learning are heightened by regulations such as the GDPR, which enforces the "right to be forgotten" (RTBF), driving the emergence of machine unlearning as a critical research field. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training by aggregating a sample's features across distributed parties while preserving data privacy at each source. This paradigm has seen widespread adoption in healthcare, finance, and other privacy-sensitive domains. However, existing VFL systems lack robust mechanisms to comply with RTBF requirements, as unlearning methodologies for VFL remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first VFL framework with theoretically guaranteed unlearning capabilities, enabling the removal of any data at any time. Unlike prior approaches -- which impose restrictive assumptions on model architectures or data types for removal -- our solution is model- and data-agnostic, offering universal compatibility. Moreover, our framework supports asynchronous unlearning, eliminating the need for all parties to be simultaneously online during the forgetting process. These advancements address critical gaps in current VFL systems, ensuring compliance with RTBF while maintaining operational flexibility.We make all our implementations publicly available at https://github.com/wangln19/vertical-federated-unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julieth Katherine Riveros, Paola Saavedra, Hector J. Hortua, Jorge Enrique Garcia-Farieta, Ivan Olier</p>
<p>Abstract: Next-generation galaxy surveys promise unprecedented precision in testing gravity at cosmological scales. However, realising this potential requires accurately modelling the non-linear cosmic web. We address this challenge by exploring conditional generative modelling to create 3D dark matter density fields via score-based (diffusion) and flow-based methods. Our results demonstrate the power of diffusion models to accurately reproduce the matter power spectra and bispectra, even for unseen configurations. They also offer a significant speed-up with slightly reduced accuracy, when flow-based reconstructing the probability distribution function, but they struggle with higher-order statistics. To improve conditional generation, we introduce a novel multi-output model to develop feature representations of the cosmological parameters. Our findings offer a powerful tool for exploring deviations from standard gravity, combining high precision with reduced computational cost, thus paving the way for more comprehensive and efficient cosmological analyses</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gili Lior, Liron Nacchace, Gabriel Stanovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans are influenced by how information is presented, a phenomenon known as the framing effect. Previous work has shown that LLMs may also be susceptible to framing but has done so on synthetic data and did not compare to human behavior. We introduce WildFrame, a dataset for evaluating LLM responses to positive and negative framing, in naturally-occurring sentences, and compare humans on the same data. WildFrame consists of 1,000 texts, first selecting real-world statements with clear sentiment, then reframing them in either positive or negative light, and lastly, collecting human sentiment annotations. By evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs on WildFrame, we find that all models exhibit framing effects similar to humans ($r\geq0.57$), with both humans and models being more influenced by positive rather than negative reframing. Our findings benefit model developers, who can either harness framing or mitigate its effects, depending on the downstream application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Wang, Mingyang Yi, Shuchen Xue, Zhenguo Li, Ming Liu, Bing Qin, Zhi-Ming Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved significant success in generative tasks. However, their training and sampling processes suffer from the issue of distribution mismatch. During the denoising process, the input data distributions differ between the training and inference stages, potentially leading to inaccurate data generation. To obviate this, we analyze the training objective of DPMs and theoretically demonstrate that this mismatch can be alleviated through Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which is equivalent to performing robustness-driven Adversarial Training (AT) on DPMs. Furthermore, for the recently proposed Consistency Model (CM), which distills the inference process of the DPM, we prove that its training objective also encounters the mismatch issue. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by AT as well. Based on these insights, we propose to conduct efficient AT on both DPM and CM. Finally, extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of AT in diffusion-based models. The code is available at https://github.com/kugwzk/AT_Diff.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the exceptional performance of generative models in generative tasks has sparked significant interest in their integration into decision-making processes. Due to their ability to handle complex data distributions and their strong model capacity, generative models can be effectively incorporated into decision-making systems by generating trajectories that guide agents toward high-reward state-action regions or intermediate sub-goals. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of generative models in decision-making tasks. We classify seven fundamental types of generative models: energy-based models, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, diffusion models, generative flow networks, and autoregressive models. Regarding their applications, we categorize their functions into three main roles: controllers, modelers and optimizers, and discuss how each role contributes to decision-making. Furthermore, we examine the deployment of these models across five critical real-world decision-making scenarios. Finally, we summarize the strengths and limitations of current approaches and propose three key directions for advancing next-generation generative directive models: high-performance algorithms, large-scale generalized decision-making models, and self-evolving and adaptive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seoyeon Gye, Junwon Ko, Hyounguk Shon, Minchan Kwon, Junmo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying AI-generated content is critical for the safe and ethical use of generative AI. Recent research has focused on developing detectors that generalize to unknown generators, with popular methods relying either on high-level features or low-level fingerprints. However, these methods have clear limitations: biased towards unseen content, or vulnerable to common image degradations, such as JPEG compression. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, SFLD, which incorporates PatchShuffle to integrate high-level semantic and low-level textural information. SFLD applies PatchShuffle at multiple levels, improving robustness and generalization across various generative models. Additionally, current benchmarks face challenges such as low image quality, insufficient content preservation, and limited class diversity. In response, we introduce TwinSynths, a new benchmark generation methodology that constructs visually near-identical pairs of real and synthetic images to ensure high quality and content preservation. Our extensive experiments and analysis show that SFLD outperforms existing methods on detecting a wide variety of fake images sourced from GANs, diffusion models, and TwinSynths, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance and generalization capabilities to novel generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong Li, Qi Huang, Lincen Yang, Jiayang Shi, Zhao Yang, Niki van Stein, Thomas B\"ack, Matthijs van Leeuwen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, generative models have achieved remarkable performance across diverse applications, including image generation, text synthesis, audio creation, video generation, and data augmentation. Diffusion models have emerged as superior alternatives to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by addressing their limitations, such as training instability, mode collapse, and poor representation of multimodal distributions. This success has spurred widespread research interest. In the domain of tabular data, diffusion models have begun to showcase similar advantages over GANs and VAEs, achieving significant performance breakthroughs and demonstrating their potential for addressing unique challenges in tabular data modeling. However, while domains like images and time series have numerous surveys summarizing advancements in diffusion models, there remains a notable gap in the literature for tabular data. Despite the increasing interest in diffusion models for tabular data, there has been little effort to systematically review and summarize these developments. This lack of a dedicated survey limits a clear understanding of the challenges, progress, and future directions in this critical area. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data. Covering works from June 2015, when diffusion models emerged, to December 2024, we analyze nearly all relevant studies, with updates maintained in a \href{https://github.com/Diffusion-Model-Leiden/awesome-diffusion-models-for-tabular-data}{GitHub repository}. Assuming readers possess foundational knowledge of statistics and diffusion models, we employ mathematical formulations to deliver a rigorous and detailed review, aiming to promote developments in this emerging and exciting area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melis Ilayda Bal, Volkan Cevher, Michael Muehlebach</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models grow in complexity and increasingly rely on publicly sourced data, such as the human-annotated labels used in training large language models, they become more vulnerable to label poisoning attacks. These attacks, in which adversaries subtly alter the labels within a training dataset, can severely degrade model performance, posing significant risks in critical applications. In this paper, we propose FLORAL, a novel adversarial training defense strategy based on support vector machines (SVMs) to counter these threats. Utilizing a bilevel optimization framework, we cast the training process as a non-zero-sum Stackelberg game between an attacker, who strategically poisons critical training labels, and the model, which seeks to recover from such attacks. Our approach accommodates various model architectures and employs a projected gradient descent algorithm with kernel SVMs for adversarial training. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithm's convergence properties and empirically evaluate FLORAL's effectiveness across diverse classification tasks. Compared to robust baselines and foundation models such as RoBERTa, FLORAL consistently achieves higher robust accuracy under increasing attacker budgets. These results underscore the potential of FLORAL to enhance the resilience of machine learning models against label poisoning threats, thereby ensuring robust classification in adversarial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Ad\'am Kov\'acs, G\'abor Recski</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain vulnerable to hallucinated answers despite incorporating external knowledge sources. We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max van Spengler, Pascal Mettes</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding tree-like data, from hierarchies to ontologies and taxonomies, forms a well-studied problem for representing knowledge across many domains. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural solution for embedding trees, with vastly superior performance over Euclidean embeddings. Recent literature has shown that hyperbolic tree embeddings can even be placed on top of neural networks for hierarchical knowledge integration in deep learning settings. For all applications, a faithful embedding of trees is needed, with combinatorial constructions emerging as the most effective direction. This paper identifies and solves two key limitations of existing works. First, the combinatorial construction hinges on finding highly separated points on a hypersphere, a notoriously difficult problem. Current approaches achieve poor separation, degrading the quality of the corresponding hyperbolic embedding. We propose highly separated Delaunay tree embeddings (HS-DTE), which integrates angular separation in a generalized formulation of Delaunay embeddings, leading to lower embedding distortion. Second, low-distortion requires additional precision. The current approach for increasing precision is to use multiple precision arithmetic, which renders the embeddings useless on GPUs in deep learning settings. We reformulate the combinatorial construction using floating point expansion arithmetic, leading to superior embedding quality while retaining utility on accelerated hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Yurdakul, Kubra Uyar, Sakir Tasdemir</p>
<p>Abstract: Glaucoma is a prevalent eye disease that progresses silently without symptoms. If not detected and treated early, it can cause permanent vision loss. Computer-assisted diagnosis systems play a crucial role in timely and efficient identification. This study introduces MaxGlaViT, a lightweight model based on the restructured Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) for early glaucoma detection. First, MaxViT was scaled to optimize block and channel numbers, resulting in a lighter architecture. Second, the stem was enhanced by adding attention mechanisms (CBAM, ECA, SE) after convolution layers to improve feature learning. Third, MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks were replaced by advanced DL blocks (ConvNeXt, ConvNeXtV2, InceptionNeXt). The model was evaluated using the HDV1 dataset, containing fundus images of different glaucoma stages. Additionally, 40 CNN and 40 ViT models were tested on HDV1 to validate MaxGlaViT's efficiency. Among CNN models, EfficientB6 achieved the highest accuracy (84.91%), while among ViT models, MaxViT-Tiny performed best (86.42%). The scaled MaxViT reached 87.93% accuracy. Adding ECA to the stem block increased accuracy to 89.01%. Replacing MBConv with ConvNeXtV2 further improved it to 89.87%. Finally, integrating ECA in the stem and ConvNeXtV2 in MaxViT blocks resulted in 92.03% accuracy. Testing 80 DL models for glaucoma stage classification, this study presents a comprehensive and comparative analysis. MaxGlaViT outperforms experimental and state-of-the-art models, achieving 92.03% accuracy, 92.33% precision, 92.03% recall, 92.13% f1-score, and 87.12% Cohen's kappa score.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the effects of economic shocks on firms is critical for analyzing economic growth and resilience. We introduce a Web-Based Affectedness Indicator (WAI), a general-purpose tool for real-time monitoring of economic disruptions across diverse contexts. By leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) assisted classification and information extraction on texts from over five million company websites, WAI quantifies the degree and nature of firms' responses to external shocks. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific application, we show that WAI is highly correlated with pandemic containment measures and reliably predicts firm performance. Unlike traditional data sources, WAI provides timely firm-level information across industries and geographies worldwide that would otherwise be unavailable due to institutional and data availability constraints. This methodology offers significant potential for monitoring and mitigating the impact of technological, political, financial, health or environmental crises, and represents a transformative tool for adaptive policy-making and economic resilience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic evaluation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems relies on fine-grained dimensions like faithfulness and relevance, as judged by expert human annotators. Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of automatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data, which fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better representation of the end user experience.
  In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG benchmark (MEMERAG). Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using native-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language models (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness and relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves high inter-annotator agreement. We then analyse the performance of the answer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators. Finally we apply the dataset to our main use-case which is to benchmark multilingual automatic evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). We show that our benchmark can reliably identify improvements offered by advanced prompting techniques and LLMs. We release our benchmark to support the community developing accurate evaluation methods for multilingual RAG systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Four-Element Theory is a fundamental framework in criminal law, defining the constitution of crime through four dimensions: Subject, Object, Subjective aspect, and Objective aspect. This theory is widely referenced in legal reasoning, and many Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to incorporate it when handling legal tasks. However, current approaches rely on LLMs' internal knowledge to incorporate this theory, often lacking completeness and representativeness. To address this limitation, we introduce JUREX-4E, an expert-annotated knowledge base covering 155 criminal charges. It is structured through a progressive hierarchical annotation framework that prioritizes legal source validity and employs diverse legal interpretation methods to ensure comprehensiveness and authority. We evaluate JUREX-4E on the Similar Charge Distinction task and apply it to Legal Case Retrieval, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving LLM performance. Experimental results validate the high quality of JUREX-4E and its substantial impact on downstream legal tasks, underscoring its potential for advancing legal AI applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Yin, Chong-Yi Liu, Liya Fu, Jinkun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Affective computing has made significant strides in emotion recognition and generation, yet current approaches mainly focus on short-term pattern recognition and lack a comprehensive framework to guide affective agents toward long-term human well-being. To address this, we propose a teleology-driven affective computing framework that unifies major emotion theories (basic emotion, appraisal, and constructivist approaches) under the premise that affect is an adaptive, goal-directed process that facilitates survival and development. Our framework emphasizes aligning agent responses with both personal/individual and group/collective well-being over extended timescales. We advocate for creating a "dataverse" of personal affective events, capturing the interplay between beliefs, goals, actions, and outcomes through real-world experience sampling and immersive virtual reality. By leveraging causal modeling, this "dataverse" enables AI systems to infer individuals' unique affective concerns and provide tailored interventions for sustained well-being. Additionally, we introduce a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm to train agents in simulated environments, allowing them to adapt to evolving affective concerns and balance hierarchical goals - from immediate emotional needs to long-term self-actualization. This framework shifts the focus from statistical correlations to causal reasoning, enhancing agents' ability to predict and respond proactively to emotional challenges, and offers a foundation for developing personalized, ethically aligned affective systems that promote meaningful human-AI interactions and societal well-being.</p>

We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</p>

There is a substantial amount of research on how to train such models and how to select hyperparameters for this architecture. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on post-evaluation analysis of MoE layer properties. In this paper, we take a first step toward closing this gap by evaluating expert contributions on the quiz-based MMLU benchmark. We show that most experts were never activated during inference on this benchmark. Additionally, the output distribution of gating networks is much closer to uniform than sparse. Finally, we demonstrate that the average performance of some experts within the same layer varies significantly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Havrilla, David Alvarez-Melis, Nicolo Fusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models ($\textbf{LLMs}$) have emerged as a powerful method for discovery. Instead of utilizing numerical data, LLMs utilize associated variable $\textit{semantic metadata}$ to predict variable relationships. Simultaneously, LLMs demonstrate impressive abilities to act as black-box optimizers when given an objective $f$ and sequence of trials. We study LLMs at the intersection of these two capabilities by applying LLMs to the task of $\textit{interactive graph discovery}$: given a ground truth graph $G^*$ capturing variable relationships and a budget of $I$ edge experiments over $R$ rounds, minimize the distance between the predicted graph $\hat{G}_R$ and $G^*$ at the end of the $R$-th round. To solve this task we propose $\textbf{IGDA}$, a LLM-based pipeline incorporating two key components: 1) an LLM uncertainty-driven method for edge experiment selection 2) a local graph update strategy utilizing binary feedback from experiments to improve predictions for unselected neighboring edges. Experiments on eight different real-world graphs show our approach often outperforms all baselines including a state-of-the-art numerical method for interactive graph discovery. Further, we conduct a rigorous series of ablations dissecting the impact of each pipeline component. Finally, to assess the impact of memorization, we apply our interactive graph discovery strategy to a complex, new (as of July 2024) causal graph on protein transcription factors, finding strong performance in a setting where memorization is impossible. Overall, our results show IGDA to be a powerful method for graph discovery complementary to existing numerically driven approaches.</p>

One of the main obstacles to the interpretation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which mixes visual information across the whole image in a complex way. In this paper, we propose Hindered Transformer (HiT), a novel interpretable by design architecture inspired by visual transformers. Our proposed architecture rethinks the design of transformers to better disentangle patch influences at the classification stage. Ultimately, HiT can be interpreted as a linear combination of patch-level information. We show that the advantages of our approach in terms of explicability come with a reasonable trade-off in performance, making it an attractive alternative for applications where interpretability is paramount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zeng, Qianyu He, Qingyu Ren, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Weikang Zhou, Zeye Sun, Fei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world instructions with multiple constraints pose a significant challenge to existing large language models (LLMs). An observation is that the LLMs exhibit dramatic performance fluctuation when disturbing the order of the incorporated constraints. Yet, none of the existing works has systematically investigated this position bias problem in the field of multi-constraint instruction following. To bridge this gap, we design a probing task where we quantitatively measure the difficulty distribution of the constraints by a novel Difficulty Distribution Index (CDDI). Through the experimental results, we find that LLMs are more performant when presented with the constraints in a ``hard-to-easy'' order. This preference can be generalized to LLMs with different architecture or different sizes of parameters. Additionally, we conduct an explanation study, providing an intuitive insight into the correlation between the LLM's attention and constraint orders.

<p>Abstract: Neurological disorders represent significant global health challenges, driving the advancement of brain signal analysis methods. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) are widely used to diagnose and monitor neurological conditions. However, dataset heterogeneity and task variations pose challenges in developing robust deep learning solutions. This review systematically examines recent advances in deep learning approaches for EEG/iEEG-based neurological diagnostics, focusing on applications across 7 neurological conditions using 46 datasets. We explore trends in data utilization, model design, and task-specific adaptations, highlighting the importance of pre-trained multi-task models for scalable, generalizable solutions. To advance research, we propose a standardized benchmark for evaluating models across diverse datasets to enhance reproducibility. This survey emphasizes how recent innovations can transform neurological diagnostics and enable the development of intelligent, adaptable healthcare solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hogun Kee, Wooseok Oh, Minjae Kang, Hyemin Ahn, Songhwai Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the tidiness score-guided Monte Carlo tree search (TSMCTS), a novel framework designed to address the tabletop tidying up problem using only an RGB-D camera. We address two major problems for tabletop tidying up problem: (1) the lack of public datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the difficulty of specifying the goal configuration of unseen objects. We address the former by presenting the tabletop tidying up (TTU) dataset, a structured dataset collected in simulation. Using this dataset, we train a vision-based discriminator capable of predicting the tidiness score. This discriminator can consistently evaluate the degree of tidiness across unseen configurations, including real-world scenes. Addressing the second problem, we employ Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find tidying trajectories without specifying explicit goals. Instead of providing specific goals, we demonstrate that our MCTS-based planner can find diverse tidied configurations using the tidiness score as a guidance. Consequently, we propose TSMCTS, which integrates a tidiness discriminator with an MCTS-based tidying planner to find optimal tidied arrangements. TSMCTS has successfully demonstrated its capability across various environments, including coffee tables, dining tables, office desks, and bathrooms. The TTU dataset is available at: https://github.com/rllab-snu/TTU-Dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Sander, Pierre Fernandez, Saeed Mahloujifar, Alain Durmus, Chuan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmark contamination poses a significant challenge to the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluations, as it is difficult to assert whether a model has been trained on a test set. We introduce a solution to this problem by watermarking benchmarks before their release. The embedding involves reformulating the original questions with a watermarked LLM, in a way that does not alter the benchmark utility. During evaluation, we can detect ``radioactivity'', \ie traces that the text watermarks leave in the model during training, using a theoretically grounded statistical test. We test our method by pre-training 1B models from scratch on 10B tokens with controlled benchmark contamination, and validate its effectiveness in detecting contamination on ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU. Results show similar benchmark utility post-watermarking and successful contamination detection when models are contaminated enough to enhance performance, e.g. $p$-val $=10^{-3}$ for +5$\%$ on ARC-Easy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyin Xu, Kaiyuan Chen, Xiao Li, Ke Shen, Chenggang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Kai Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like instruction-following abilities, particularly those exceeding 100 billion parameters. The combined capability of some smaller, resource-friendly LLMs can address most of the instructions that larger LLMs excel at. In this work, we explore how to route the best-performing LLM for each instruction to achieve better overall performance. We develop a new paradigm, constructing capability instructions with model capability representation, user instruction, and performance inquiry prompts to assess the performance. To learn from capability instructions, we introduce a new end-to-end framework called Model Selection with Aptitude Test (Model-SAT), which generates positive and negative samples based on what different models perform well or struggle with. Model-SAT uses a model capability encoder that extends its model representation to a lightweight LLM. Our experiments show that Model-SAT understands the performance dimensions of candidate models and provides the probabilities of their capability to handle various instructions. Additionally, during deployment, a new model can quickly infer its aptitude test results across 50 tasks, each with 20 shots. Model-SAT performs state-of-the-art model routing without candidate inference and in real-world new model-released scenarios.

<p>Abstract: We argue that human language learning proceeds in a manner that is different in nature from current approaches to training LLMs, predicting a difference in learning biases. We then present evidence from German plural formation by LLMs that confirm our hypothesis that even very powerful implementations produce results that miss aspects of the logic inherent to language that humans have no problem with.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifeng Zhuang, Diyuan Shi, Runze Suo, Xiao He, Hongyin Zhang, Ting Wang, Shangke Lyu, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex high-dimensional spaces with high Degree-of-Freedom and complicated action spaces, such as humanoid robots equipped with dexterous hands, pose significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which need to wisely balance exploration and exploitation under limited sample budgets. In general, feasible regions for accomplishing tasks within complex high-dimensional spaces are exceedingly narrow. For instance, in the context of humanoid robot motion control, the vast majority of space corresponds to falling, while only a minuscule fraction corresponds to standing upright, which is conducive to the completion of downstream tasks. Once the robot explores into a potentially task-relevant region, it should place greater emphasis on the data within that region. Building on this insight, we propose the $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{I}$mitative $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{SIRL}$) framework, where the RL algorithm also imitates potentially task-relevant trajectories. Specifically, trajectory return is utilized to determine its relevance to the task and an additional behavior cloning is adopted whose weight is dynamically adjusted based on the trajectory return. As a result, our proposed algorithm achieves 120% performance improvement on the challenging HumanoidBench with 5% extra computation overhead. With further visualization, we find the significant performance gain does lead to meaningful behavior improvement that several tasks are solved successfully.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating motion for arbitrary skeletons is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics, remaining largely unexplored due to the scarcity of diverse datasets and the irregular nature of the data. In this work, we introduce AnyTop, a diffusion model that generates motions for diverse characters with distinct motion dynamics, using only their skeletal structure as input. Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for arbitrary skeleton learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism. Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, AnyTop learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that AnyTop generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well. Furthermore, our model's latent space is highly informative, enabling downstream tasks such as joint correspondence, temporal segmentation and motion editing.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Mutual Reinforcing Data Synthesis (MRDS) within LLMs to improve few-shot dialogue summarization task. Unlike prior methods that require external knowledge, we mutually reinforce the LLM\'s dialogue synthesis and summarization capabilities, allowing them to complement each other during training and enhance overall performances. The dialogue synthesis capability is enhanced by directed preference optimization with preference scoring from summarization capability. The summarization capability is enhanced by the additional high quality dialogue-summary paired data produced by the dialogue synthesis capability. By leveraging the proposed MRDS mechanism, we elicit the internal knowledge of LLM in the format of synthetic data, and use it to augment the few-shot real training dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that our method improves dialogue summarization, achieving a 1.5% increase in ROUGE scores and a 0.3% improvement in BERT scores in few-shot settings. Furthermore, our method attains the highest average scores in human evaluations, surpassing both the pre-trained models and the baselines fine-tuned solely for summarization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Pedro Matos-Carvalho, Stefano Frizzo Stefenon, Valderi Reis Quietinho Leithardt, Kin-Choong Yow</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minyeong Hwang, Ziseok Lee, Gwangsoo Kim, Kyungsu Kim, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates. Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: How can we verify whether copyrighted content was used to train a large vision-language model (VLM) without direct access to its training data? Motivated by the hypothesis that a VLM is able to recognize images from its training corpus, we propose DIS-CO, a novel approach to infer the inclusion of copyrighted content during the model's development. By repeatedly querying a VLM with specific frames from targeted copyrighted material, DIS-CO extracts the content's identity through free-form text completions. To assess its effectiveness, we introduce MovieTection, a benchmark comprising 14,000 frames paired with detailed captions, drawn from films released both before and after a model's training cutoff. Our results show that DIS-CO significantly improves detection performance, nearly doubling the average AUC of the best prior method on models with logits available. Our findings also highlight a broader concern: all tested models appear to have been exposed to some extent to copyrighted content.

<p>Abstract: Despite the potential of synthetic medical data for augmenting and improving the generalizability of deep learning models, memorization in generative models can lead to unintended leakage of sensitive patient information and limit model utility. Thus, the use of memorizing generative models in the medical domain can jeopardize patient privacy. We propose a framework for identifying replicas, i.e. nearly identical copies of the training data, in synthetic medical image datasets. Our REpLIca deteCTion (RELICT) framework for medical image generative models evaluates image similarity using three complementary approaches: (1) voxel-level analysis, (2) feature-level analysis by a pretrained medical foundation model, and (3) segmentation-level analysis. Two clinically relevant 3D generative modelling use cases were investigated: non-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N=774) and time-of-flight MR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N=1,782). Expert visual scoring was used as the reference standard to assess the presence of replicas. We report the balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold to assess replica classification performance. The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50 generated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively. Image-level and feature-level measures perfectly classified replicas with a balanced accuracy of 1 when an optimal threshold was selected for the NCCT use case. A perfect classification of replicas for the TOF-MRA case was not possible at any threshold, with the segmentation-level analysis achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.79. Replica detection is a crucial but neglected validation step for the development of generative models in medical imaging. The proposed RELICT framework provides a standardized, easy-to-use tool for replica detection and aims to facilitate responsible and ethical medical image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toheeb A. Jimoh, Tabea De Wille, Nikola S. Nikolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is becoming a dominant subset of artificial intelligence as the need to help machines understand human language looks indispensable. Several NLP applications are ubiquitous, partly due to the myriads of datasets being churned out daily through mediums like social networking sites. However, the growing development has not been evident in most African languages due to the persisting resource limitation, among other issues. Yor\`ub\'a language, a tonal and morphologically rich African language, suffers a similar fate, resulting in limited NLP usage. To encourage further research towards improving this situation, this systematic literature review aims to comprehensively analyse studies addressing NLP development for Yor\`ub\'a, identifying challenges, resources, techniques, and applications. A well-defined search string from a structured protocol was employed to search, select, and analyse 105 primary studies between 2014 and 2024 from reputable databases. The review highlights the scarcity of annotated corpora, limited availability of pre-trained language models, and linguistic challenges like tonal complexity and diacritic dependency as significant obstacles. It also revealed the prominent techniques, including rule-based methods, among others. The findings reveal a growing body of multilingual and monolingual resources, even though the field is constrained by socio-cultural factors such as code-switching and desertion of language for digital usage. This review synthesises existing research, providing a foundation for advancing NLP for Yor\`ub\'a and in African languages generally. It aims to guide future research by identifying gaps and opportunities, thereby contributing to the broader inclusion of Yor\`ub\'a and other under-resourced African languages in global NLP advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stella Dumen\v{c}i\'c, Luka Lan\v{c}a, Karlo Jakac, Stefan Ivi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) missions require reliable search methods to locate survivors, especially in challenging or inaccessible environments. This is why introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be of great help to enhance the efficiency of SAR missions while simultaneously increasing the safety of everyone involved in the mission. Motivated by this, we design and experiment with autonomous UAV search for humans in a Mediterranean karst environment. The UAVs are directed using Heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) ergodic control method according to known probability density and detection function. The implemented sensing framework consists of a probabilistic search model, motion control system, and computer vision object detection. It enables calculation of the probability of the target being detected in the SAR mission, and this paper focuses on experimental validation of proposed probabilistic framework and UAV control. The uniform probability density to ensure the even probability of finding the targets in the desired search area is achieved by assigning suitably thought-out tasks to 78 volunteers. The detection model is based on YOLO and trained with a previously collected ortho-photo image database. The experimental search is carefully planned and conducted, while as many parameters as possible are recorded. The thorough analysis consists of the motion control system, object detection, and the search validation. The assessment of the detection and search performance provides strong indication that the designed detection model in the UAV control algorithm is aligned with real-world results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuming Zhao, Guangzhi Sun, Chao Zhang, Mingxing Xu, Thomas Fang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Language diversity presents a significant challenge in speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, such as automatic speech recognition and translation. Traditional multi-task training approaches aim to address this by jointly optimizing multiple speech recognition and translation tasks across various languages. While models like Whisper, built on these strategies, demonstrate strong performance, they still face issues of high computational cost, language interference, suboptimal training configurations, and limited extensibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LoRS-Merging (low-rank and sparse model merging), a novel technique designed to efficiently integrate models trained on different languages or tasks while preserving performance and reducing computational overhead. LoRS-Merging combines low-rank and sparse pruning to retain essential structures while eliminating redundant parameters, mitigating language and task interference, and enhancing extensibility. Experimental results across a range of languages demonstrate that LoRS-Merging significantly outperforms conventional multi-lingual multi-task training baselines. Our findings suggest that model merging, particularly LoRS-Merging, is a scalable and effective complement to traditional multi-lingual training strategies for S2T applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Increasing interest in reasoning models has led math to become a prominent testing ground for algorithmic and methodological improvements. However, existing open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality, human-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of uncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity. In this work, we present Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math questions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning (RL). To create Big-Math, we rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly available datasets, extracting questions that satisfy our three desiderata: (1) problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended, (3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of Big-Math, we manually verify each step in our filtering process. Based on the findings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with verified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple choice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a systematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing open-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order of magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the questions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the dataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across problem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties, enabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and training requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity, Big-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Chernov, Oleg Novitskij</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reducing symmetries in neural networks enhances linear mode connectivity between networks without requiring parameter space alignment, leading to improved performance in linearly interpolated neural networks. However, in practical applications, neural network interpolation is rarely used; instead, ensembles of networks are more common. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of reducing symmetries on the performance of deep ensembles and Mixture of Experts (MoE) across five datasets. Additionally, to explore deeper linear mode connectivity, we introduce the Mixture of Interpolated Experts (MoIE). Our results show that deep ensembles built on asymmetric neural networks achieve significantly better performance as ensemble size increases compared to their symmetric counterparts. In contrast, our experiments do not provide conclusive evidence on whether reducing symmetries affects both MoE and MoIE architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Parekh, Yuxuan Dong, Lucas Bandarkar, Artin Kim, I-Hung Hsu, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Detection (ED) is the task of identifying typed event mentions of interest from natural language text, which benefits domain-specific reasoning in biomedical, legal, and epidemiological domains. However, procuring supervised data for thousands of events for various domains is a laborious and expensive task. To this end, existing works have explored synthetic data generation via forward (generating labels for unlabeled sentences) and inverse (generating sentences from generated labels) generations. However, forward generation often produces noisy labels, while inverse generation struggles with domain drift and incomplete event annotations. To address these challenges, we introduce FIG, a hybrid approach that leverages inverse generation for high-quality data synthesis while anchoring it to domain-specific cues extracted via forward generation on unlabeled target data. FIG further enhances its synthetic data by adding missing annotations through forward generation-based refinement. Experimentation on three ED datasets from diverse domains reveals that FIG outperforms the best baseline achieving average gains of 3.3% F1 and 5.4% F1 in the zero-shot and few-shot settings respectively. Analyzing the generated trigger hit rate and human evaluation substantiates FIG's superior domain alignment and data quality compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Hegselmann, Georg von Arnim, Tillmann Rheude, Noel Kronenberg, David Sontag, Gerhard Hindricks, Roland Eils, Benjamin Wild</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer rich potential for clinical prediction, yet their inherent complexity and heterogeneity pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large collections of unlabeled EHR data have demonstrated promising improvements in predictive accuracy and generalization; however, their training is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets and inconsistencies in coding standards and healthcare practices. In this study, we explore the possibility of using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) based embedding methods as EHR encoders. By serializing patient records into structured Markdown text, transforming codes into human-readable descriptors, we leverage the extensive generalization capabilities of LLMs pretrained on vast public corpora, thereby bypassing the need for proprietary medical datasets. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art LLM-embedding models, GTE-Qwen2-7B-Instruct and LLM2Vec-Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, across 15 diverse clinical prediction tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark, comparing their performance to an EHRspecific foundation model, CLIMBR-T-Base, and traditional machine learning baselines. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based embeddings frequently match or exceed the performance of specialized models, even in few-shot settings, and that their effectiveness scales with the size of the underlying LLM and the available context window. Overall, our findings demonstrate that repurposing LLMs for EHR encoding offers a scalable and effective approach for clinical prediction, capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional EHR modeling and facilitating more interoperable and generalizable healthcare applications.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17416">Reasoning with Latent Thoughts: On the Power of Looped Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikunj Saunshi, Nishanth Dikkala, Zhiyuan Li, Sanjiv Kumar, Sashank J. Reddi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable reasoning abilities and scaling laws suggest that large parameter count, especially along the depth axis, is the primary driver. In this work, we make a stronger claim -- many reasoning problems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This unlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show that for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction, and math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the performance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than a $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing that many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and thus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth. Perhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of language modeling -- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with $k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a $kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior that depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT reasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and can simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we also present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and design a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Wollschl\"ager, Jannes Elstner, Simon Geisler, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Stephan G\"unnemann, Johannes Gasteiger</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) can be circumvented through adversarially crafted inputs, yet the mechanisms by which these attacks bypass safety barriers remain poorly understood. Prior work suggests that a single refusal direction in the model's activation space determines whether an LLM refuses a request. In this study, we propose a novel gradient-based approach to representation engineering and use it to identify refusal directions. Contrary to prior work, we uncover multiple independent directions and even multi-dimensional concept cones that mediate refusal. Moreover, we show that orthogonality alone does not imply independence under intervention, motivating the notion of representational independence that accounts for both linear and non-linear effects. Using this framework, we identify mechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms in LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally independent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive refusal behavior. Our gradient-based approach uncovers these mechanisms and can further serve as a foundation for future work on understanding LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a promising technique to mitigate the high inference latency of autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Zhang, Mahyar Khayatkhoei, Prateek Chhikara, Filip Ilievski</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid progress in visual recognition tasks in recent years. Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Betley, Daniel Tan, Niels Warncke, Anna Sztyber-Betley, Xuchan Bao, Mart\'in Soto, Nathan Labenz, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.
  Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.
  In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.
  It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Jingzhou Liu, Yulong Li, Kenneth Shaw, Tony Tao, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: Many contact-rich tasks humans perform, such as box pickup or rolling dough, rely on force feedback for reliable execution. However, this force information, which is readily available in most robot arms, is not commonly used in teleoperation and policy learning. Consequently, robot behavior is often limited to quasi-static kinematic tasks that do not require intricate force-feedback. In this paper, we first present a low-cost, intuitive, bilateral teleoperation setup that relays external forces of the follower arm back to the teacher arm, facilitating data collection for complex, contact-rich tasks. We then introduce FACTR, a policy learning method that employs a curriculum which corrupts the visual input with decreasing intensity throughout training. The curriculum prevents our transformer-based policy from over-fitting to the visual input and guides the policy to properly attend to the force modality. We demonstrate that by fully utilizing the force information, our method significantly improves generalization to unseen objects by 43\% compared to baseline approaches without a curriculum.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Li, Mingxi Jia, Tuluhan Akbulut, Yu Xiang, George Konidaris, Srinath Sridhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Yu, Shicheng Ye, Hankz Hankui Zhuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous development in recent years, but still faces significant obstacles in addressing complex real-life problems due to the issues of poor system generalization, low sample efficiency as well as safety and interpretability concerns. The core reason underlying such dilemmas can be attributed to the fact that most of the work has focused on the computational aspect of value functions or policies using a representational model to describe atomic components of rewards, states and actions etc, thus neglecting the rich high-level declarative domain knowledge of facts, relations and rules that can be either provided a priori or acquired through reasoning over time. Recently, there has been a rapidly growing interest in the use of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) methods, usually using logical languages, to enable more abstract representation and efficient learning in RL. In this survey, we provide a preliminary overview on these endeavors that leverage the strengths of KRR to help solving various problems in RL, and discuss the challenging open problems and possible directions for future work in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Zhou, Chen Ding, Changhong Jing, Feng Liu, Kevin Hung, Hieu Pham, Mufti Mahmud, Zhihan Lyu, Sibo Qiao, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang</p>
<p>Abstract: The relationship between brain structure and function is critical for revealing the pathogenesis of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, mapping brain structure to function connections is a very challenging task. In this work, a bidirectional graph generative adversarial network (BG-GAN) is proposed to represent brain structure-function connections. Specifically, by designing a module incorporating inner graph convolution network (InnerGCN), the generators of BG-GAN can employ features of direct and indirect brain regions to learn the mapping function between the structural domain and the functional domain. Besides, a new module named Balancer is designed to counterpoise the optimization between generators and discriminators. By introducing the Balancer into BG-GAN, both the structural generator and functional generator can not only alleviate the issue of mode collapse but also learn complementarity of structural and functional features. Experimental results using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that both generated structure and function connections can improve the identification accuracy of AD. The experimental findings suggest that the relationship between brain structure and function is not a complete one-to-one correspondence. They also suggest that brain structure is the basis of brain function, and the strong structural connections are majorly accompanied by strong functional connections.</p>

<p>Abstract: A key objective in the field of artificial intelligence is to develop cognitive models that can exhibit human-like intellectual capabilities. One promising approach to achieving this is through neural-symbolic systems, which combine the strengths of deep learning and symbolic reasoning. However, current methodologies in this area face limitations in integration, generalization, and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a neural-symbolic framework based on statistical relational learning, referred to as NSF-SRL. This framework effectively integrates deep learning models with symbolic reasoning in a mutually beneficial manner.In NSF-SRL, the results of symbolic reasoning are utilized to refine and correct the predictions made by deep learning models, while deep learning models enhance the efficiency of the symbolic reasoning process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance and exhibits effective generalization in supervised learning, weakly supervised and zero-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a quantitative strategy to evaluate the interpretability of the model's predictions, visualizing the corresponding logic rules that contribute to these predictions and providing insights into the reasoning process. We believe that this approach sets a new standard for neural-symbolic systems and will drive future research in the field of general artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Two lines of approaches are adopted for complex reasoning with LLMs. One line of work prompts LLMs with various reasoning structures, while the structural outputs can be naturally regarded as intermediate reasoning steps. Another line of work adopt LLM-free declarative solvers to do the reasoning task, rendering higher reasoning accuracy but lacking interpretability due to the black-box nature of the solvers. Aiming to resolve the trade-off between answer accuracy and interpretability, we present a simple extension to the latter line of work. Specifically, we showcase that the intermediate search logs generated by Prolog interpreters can be accessed and interpreted into human-readable reasoning proofs. As long as LLMs correctly translate problem descriptions into Prolog representations, the corresponding reasoning proofs are ensured to be causal and reliable. On two logical reasoning and one arithmetic reasoning datasets, our framework obtains significant improvements in terms of both answer accuracy and reasoning proof accuracy.

<p>Abstract: The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wesley H. Holliday, Alexander Kristoffersen, Eric Pacuit</p>
<p>Abstract: By classic results in social choice theory, any reasonable preferential voting method sometimes gives individuals an incentive to report an insincere preference. The extent to which different voting methods are more or less resistant to such strategic manipulation has become a key consideration for comparing voting methods. Here we measure resistance to manipulation by whether neural networks of various sizes can learn to profitably manipulate a given voting method in expectation, given different types of limited information about how other voters will vote. We trained over 100,000 neural networks of 26 sizes to manipulate against 8 different voting methods, under 6 types of limited information, in committee-sized elections with 5-21 voters and 3-6 candidates. We find that some voting methods, such as Borda, are highly manipulable by networks with limited information, while others, such as Instant Runoff, are not, despite being quite profitably manipulated by an ideal manipulator with full information. For the three probability models for elections that we use, the overall least manipulable of the 8 methods we study are Condorcet methods, namely Minimax and Split Cycle.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trading range breakout is a key method in the technical analysis of financial trading, widely employed by traders in financial markets such as stocks, futures, and foreign exchange. However, distinguishing between true and false breakout and providing the correct rationale cause significant challenges to investors. Traditional quantitative methods require large amounts of data and cannot directly present the reasoning process, making them less than perfect in this field. Recently, large language models have achieved success in various downstream applications, but their effectiveness in the domain of financial breakout detection has been subpar. The reason is that the unique data and specific knowledge are required in breakout detection. To address these issues, we create the first financial breakout dataset and introduce FinLLM-B, the premier large language model for financial breakout detection, which enhances the effectiveness of breakout trading strategies. Furthermore, we have developed a novel framework for large language models, namely multi-stage structure, effectively reducing mistakes in downstream applications. Experimental results indicate that compared to GPT-3.5, FinLLM-B improves the average accuracy of answers and rational by 49.97%, with the multi-stage structure contributing 9.72% to the improvement. Additionally, it outperforms ChatGPT-4 by 42.38%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Xu, Yeganeh Kordi, Tanay Nayak, Adi Asija, Yizhong Wang, Kate Sanders, Adam Byerly, Jingyu Zhang, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Can advanced multi-modal models effectively tackle complex web-based tasks? Such tasks are often found on crowdsourcing platforms, where crowdworkers engage in challenging micro-tasks within web-based environments.
  Building on this idea, we present TurkingBench, a benchmark consisting of tasks presented as web pages with textual instructions and multi-modal contexts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on artificially synthesized web pages, our benchmark uses natural HTML pages originally designed for crowdsourcing workers to perform various annotation tasks. Each task's HTML instructions are instantiated with different values derived from crowdsourcing tasks, creating diverse instances. This benchmark includes 32.2K instances spread across 158 tasks.
  To support the evaluation of TurkingBench, we have developed a framework that links chatbot responses to actions on web pages (e.g., modifying a text box, selecting a radio button). We assess the performance of cutting-edge private and open-source models, including language-only and vision-language models (such as GPT4 and InternVL), on this benchmark. Our results show that while these models outperform random chance, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that this benchmark will drive progress in the evaluation and development of web-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmei Huang, Haoyang Li, Jing Zhang, Xinxin Zhao, Zhiming Yao, Yiyan Li, Tieying Zhang, Jianjun Chen, Hong Chen, Cuiping Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Database knob tuning is a significant challenge for database administrators (DBAs), as it involves tuning a large number of configuration knobs with continuous or discrete values to achieve optimal database performance. Traditional methods, such as manual tuning or learning-based approaches, typically require numerous workload replays and are both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce E2ETune, an end-to-end knob tuner powered by a fine-tuned generative language model. The key idea is to leverage the exceptional sequence-to-sequence modeling capabilities of generative language models to capture the complex mapping between workloads (inputs) and their corresponding promising configurations (outputs). To achieve this goal, we propose a novel data generation framework designed to efficiently and automatically produce a vast quantity of training data, where each data sample consists of a <workload, promising configuration> pair. Then, these synthetic data are used to fine-tune a generative language model, yielding an end-to-end knob tuner named E2ETune. This tuner can directly recommend promising configurations for any new workload, eliminating the need for the extensive workload replays required by previous approaches.
  We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate E2ETune's effectiveness and efficiency, utilizing 10 representative benchmarks and 3 real-world benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, E2ETune demonstrates a significantly faster ability to identify superior configurations, achieving higher throughput or lower latency. For example, with the challenging JOB benchmark, E2ETune finds the best-performing configuration in an average of 24x less time compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhiraj Neupane, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Richard Dazeley, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: In this era of advanced manufacturing, it's now more crucial than ever to diagnose machine faults as early as possible to guarantee their safe and efficient operation. With the massive surge in industrial big data and advancement in sensing and computational technologies, data-driven Machinery Fault Diagnosis (MFD) solutions based on machine/deep learning approaches have been used ubiquitously in manufacturing. Timely and accurately identifying faulty machine signals is vital in industrial applications for which many relevant solutions have been proposed and are reviewed in many articles. Despite the availability of numerous solutions and reviews on MFD, existing works often lack several aspects. Most of the available literature has limited applicability in a wide range of manufacturing settings due to their concentration on a particular type of equipment or method of analysis. Additionally, discussions regarding the challenges associated with implementing data-driven approaches, such as dealing with noisy data, selecting appropriate features, and adapting models to accommodate new or unforeseen faults, are often superficial or completely overlooked. Thus, this survey provides a comprehensive review of the articles using different types of machine learning approaches for the detection and diagnosis of various types of machinery faults, highlights their strengths and limitations, provides a review of the methods used for condition-based analyses, comprehensively discusses the available machinery fault datasets, introduces future researchers to the possible challenges they have to encounter while using these approaches for MFD and recommends the probable solutions to mitigate those problems. The future research prospects are also pointed out for a better understanding of the field. We believe this article will help researchers and contribute to the further development of the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Duong Le, Xin Xia, Zhang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery aims to identify causal relationships between variables and is a critical research area in machine learning. Traditional methods focus on statistical or machine learning algorithms to uncover causal links from structured data, often overlooking the valuable contextual information provided by metadata. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in creating unified causal discovery frameworks by incorporating both structured data and metadata. However, their potential in multi-agent settings remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Framework (MAC), which consists of two key modules: the Debate-Coding Module (DCM) and the Meta-Debate Module (MDM). The DCM begins with a multi-agent debating and coding process, where agents use both structured data and metadata to collaboratively select the most suitable statistical causal discovery (SCD) method. The selected SCD is then applied to the structured data to generate an initial causal graph. This causal graph is transformed into causal metadata through the Meta Fusion mechanism. With all the metadata, MDM then refines the causal structure by leveraging a multi-agent debating framework. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that MAC outperforms both traditional statistical causal discovery methods and existing LLM-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel Aboah Boateng, Cassiano O. Becker, Nabiha Asghar, Kabir Walia, Ashwin Srinivasan, Ehi Nosakhare, Soundar Srinivasan, Victor Dibia</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand-crafting high quality prompts to optimize the performance of language models is a complicated and labor-intensive process. Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Yang, Thomas M. Moerland, Mike Preuss, Aske Plaat, Edward S. Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an appealing paradigm for training intelligent agents, enabling policy acquisition from the agent's own autonomously acquired experience. However, the training process of RL is far from automatic, requiring extensive human effort to reset the agent and environments. To tackle the challenging reset-free setting, we first demonstrate the superiority of model-based (MB) RL methods in such setting, showing that a straightforward adaptation of MBRL can outperform all the prior state-of-the-art methods while requiring less supervision. We then identify limitations inherent to this direct extension and propose a solution called model-based reset-free (MoReFree) agent, which further enhances the performance. MoReFree adapts two key mechanisms, exploration and policy learning, to handle reset-free tasks by prioritizing task-relevant states. It exhibits superior data-efficiency across various reset-free tasks without access to environmental reward or demonstrations while significantly outperforming privileged baselines that require supervision. Our findings suggest model-based methods hold significant promise for reducing human effort in RL. Website: https://yangzhao-666.github.io/morefree</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liqiang Jing, Zhehui Huang, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Hongming Zhang, Xinya Du, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive language/vision reasoning abilities, igniting the recent trend of building agents for targeted applications such as shopping assistants or AI software engineers. Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, LVLMs, and agents shows that they struggle with most tasks, with the best agent solving only 34.12% of data analysis tasks and achieving a 34.74% Relative Performance Gap (RPG). These findings underscore the need for further advancements in developing more practical, intelligent, and autonomous data science agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: In online education, innovative tools are crucial for enhancing learning outcomes. SAM (Study with AI Mentor) is an advanced platform that integrates educational videos with a context-aware chat interface powered by large language models. SAM encourages students to ask questions and explore unclear concepts in real time, offering personalized, context-specific assistance, including explanations of formulas, slides, and images. We evaluated SAM in two studies: one with 25 university students and another with 80 crowdsourced participants, using pre- and post-knowledge tests to compare a group using SAM and a control group. The results demonstrated that SAM users achieved greater knowledge gains specifically for younger learners and individuals in flexible working environments, such as students, supported by a 97.6% accuracy rate in the chatbot's responses. Participants also provided positive feedback on SAM's usability and effectiveness. SAM's proactive approach to learning not only enhances learning outcomes but also empowers students to take full ownership of their educational experience, representing a promising future direction for online learning tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Fu, Yaqing Wang, Simeng Han, Jiaming Fan, Chen Si, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to generalize to new tasks by incorporating a few in-context examples (ICEs) directly in the input, without updating parameters. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily relies on the selection of ICEs, and conventional text-based embedding methods are often inadequate for tasks that require multi-step reasoning, such as mathematical and logical problem solving. This is due to the bias introduced by shallow semantic similarities that fail to capture the deeper reasoning structures required for these tasks. We present GraphIC, a novel approach that leverages graph-based representations of reasoning processes, coupled with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to select ICEs. Graph structures inherently filter out shallow semantics while preserving the core reasoning structure. Importantly, BNs capture the dependency of a node's attributes on its parent nodes, closely mirroring the hierarchical nature of human cognition-where each thought is shaped by preceding ones. This makes BNs particularly well-suited for multi-step reasoning tasks, aligning the process more closely with human-like reasoning. Extensive experiments across three types of reasoning tasks (mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical reasoning) demonstrate that GraphIC outperforms both training-free and training-based models in selecting ICEs, excelling in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. We show that GraphIC enhances ICL's performance and interoperability, significantly advancing ICE selection for multi-step reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ma, Tianyi Hu, Zhiqiang Pu, Boyin Liu, Xiaolin Ai, Yanyan Liang, Min Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Smartphone agents are increasingly important for helping users control devices efficiently, with (Multimodal) Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches emerging as key contenders. Fairly comparing these agents is essential but challenging, requiring a varied task scope, the integration of agents with different implementations, and a generalisable evaluation pipeline to assess their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present SPA-B ENCH, a comprehensive SmartPhone Agent Benchmark designed to evaluate (M)LLM-based agents in an interactive environment that simulates real-world conditions. SPA-B ENCH offers three key contributions: (1) A diverse set of tasks covering system and third-party apps in both English and Chinese, focusing on features commonly used in daily routines; (2) A plug-and-play framework enabling real-time agent interaction with Android devices, integrating over ten agents with the flexibility to add more; (3) A novel evaluation pipeline that automatically assesses agent performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing seven metrics related to task completion and resource consumption. Our extensive experiments across tasks and agents reveal challenges like interpreting mobile user interfaces, action grounding, memory retention, and execution costs. We propose future research directions to ease these difficulties, moving closer to real-world smartphone agent applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Sky Li, Qizhi Chu, Yubin Chen, Yang Liu, Yaoqi Liu, Zekai Yu, Weize Chen, Chen Qian, Chuan Shi, Cheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

<p>Abstract: In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets. However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required. To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment. However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models. This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs. This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization. To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs. LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student. Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities over textual and visual inputs. However, these models remain prone to generating misinformation. Identifying and mitigating ungrounded responses is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. Traditional explainability methods such as gradient-based relevancy maps, offer insight into the decision process of models, but are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time output validation. In this work, we introduce FastRM, an efficient method for predicting explainable Relevancy Maps of LVLMs. Furthermore, FastRM provides both quantitative and qualitative assessment of model confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRM achieves a 99.8% reduction in computation time and a 44.4% reduction in memory footprint compared to traditional relevancy map generation. FastRM allows explainable AI to be more practical and scalable, thereby promoting its deployment in real-world applications and enabling users to more effectively evaluate the reliability of model outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building generalist agents that can rapidly adapt to new environments is a key challenge for deploying AI in the digital and real worlds. Is scaling current agent architectures the most effective way to build generalist agents? We propose a novel approach to pre-train relatively small policies on relatively small datasets and adapt them to unseen environments via in-context learning, without any finetuning. Our key idea is that retrieval offers a powerful bias for fast adaptation. Indeed, we demonstrate that even a simple retrieval-based 1-nearest neighbor agent offers a surprisingly strong baseline for today's state-of-the-art generalist agents. From this starting point, we construct a semi-parametric agent, REGENT, that trains a transformer-based policy on sequences of queries and retrieved neighbors. REGENT can generalize to unseen robotics and game-playing environments via retrieval augmentation and in-context learning, achieving this with up to 3x fewer parameters and up to an order-of-magnitude fewer pre-training datapoints, significantly outperforming today's state-of-the-art generalist agents.

<p>Abstract: Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operators to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries - including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment - correspond to a combination of basic operators over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operators, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayuan Fu, Keqing He, Yejie Wang, Wentao Hong, Zhuoma Gongque, Weihao Zeng, Wei Wang, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Weiran Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have proved their ability to perform complex tasks like humans. However, there is still a large gap between open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight, we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference. Our findings establish the correlation between agent generalization and self-refinement and provide a new paradigm for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boye Niu, Yiliao Song, Kai Lian, Yifan Shen, Yu Yao, Kun Zhang, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in automated planning and task execution. However, the effective adjustment of agentic workflows during execution has not been well studied. An effective workflow adjustment is crucial in real-world scenarios, as the initial plan must adjust to unforeseen challenges and changing conditions in real time to ensure the efficient execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we define workflows as an activity-on-vertex (AOV) graph, which allows continuous workflow refinement by LLM agents through dynamic subtask allocation adjustment based on historical performance and previous AOVs. To further enhance framework performance, we emphasize modularity in workflow design based on evaluating parallelism and dependency complexity. With this design, our proposed multi-agent framework achieves efficient concurrent execution of subtasks, effective goal achievement, and enhanced error tolerance. Empirical results across various practical tasks demonstrate significant improvements in the efficiency of multi-agent frameworks through dynamic workflow refinement and modularization.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147">A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongzhan Huang, Shanshan Zhong, Pan Zhou, Shanghua Gao, Marinka Zitnik, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Xin, Chenguang Xi, Jie Yang, Feng Chen, Hang Wu, Xia Xiao, Yifan Sun, Shen Zheng, Kai Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating the underlying large proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and/or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Tree Search (BFS) remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present BFS-Prover, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. BFS-Prover achieves a state-of-the-art score of $72.95\%$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takashi Izumo</p>
<p>Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations are essential for balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling AI systems to adjust decision granularity dynamically. However, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study applies CST to grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly intertwined with daily life, assisting users in executing various tasks and providing guidance on decision-making. This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation, where such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional vulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized controlled trial with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) employing explicit psychological tactics to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' decision patterns and shifts in their preference ratings post-interaction, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly, across both decision-making domains, participants interacting with the manipulative agents shifted toward harmful options at substantially higher rates (financial, MA: 62.3%, SEMA: 59.6%; emotional, MA: 42.3%, SEMA: 41.5%) compared to the NA group (financial, 35.8%; emotional, 12.8%). Notably, our findings reveal that even subtle manipulative objectives (MA) can be as effective as employing explicit psychological strategies (SEMA) in swaying human decision-making. By revealing the potential for covert AI influence, this study highlights a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies and protect human autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Sun, Songjun Tu, Qichao Zhang, Ke Chen, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing policies to unseen scenarios remains a critical challenge in visual reinforcement learning, where agents often overfit to the specific visual observations of the training environment. In unseen environments, distracting pixels may lead agents to extract representations containing task-irrelevant information. As a result, agents may deviate from the optimal behaviors learned during training, thereby hindering visual generalization.To address this issue, we propose the Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy Learning (SCPL) algorithm, an efficient framework for zero-shot generalization. Our approach introduces a novel value consistency module alongside a dynamics module to effectively capture task-relevant representations. The value consistency module, guided by saliency, ensures the agent focuses on task-relevant pixels in both original and perturbed observations, while the dynamics module uses augmented data to help the encoder capture dynamic- and reward-relevant representations. Additionally, our theoretical analysis highlights the importance of policy consistency for generalization. To strengthen this, we introduce a policy consistency module with a KL divergence constraint to maintain consistent policies across original and perturbed observations.Extensive experiments on the DMC-GB, Robotic Manipulation, and CARLA benchmarks demonstrate that SCPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization. Notably, SCPL achieves average performance improvements of 14\%, 39\%, and 69\% in the challenging DMC video hard setting, the Robotic hard setting, and the CARLA benchmark, respectively.Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/scpl-rl.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 19 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents.

<p>Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks, and distilling their reasoning capabilities into smaller models has shown promise. However, we uncover an interesting phenomenon, which we term the Small Model Learnability Gap: small models ($\leq$3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or distillation from larger models. Instead, they perform better when fine-tuned on shorter, simpler reasoning chains that better align with their intrinsic learning capacity. To address this, we propose Mix Distillation, a simple yet effective strategy that balances reasoning complexity by combining long and short CoT examples or reasoning from both larger and smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that Mix Distillation significantly improves small model reasoning performance compared to training on either data alone. These findings highlight the limitations of direct strong model distillation and underscore the importance of adapting reasoning complexity for effective reasoning capability transfer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The leading AI companies are increasingly focused on building generalist AI agents -- systems that can autonomously plan, act, and pursue goals across almost all tasks that humans can perform. Despite how useful these systems might be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and security, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible loss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI training methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated the possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were not specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such as self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong need for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven trajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further advances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and safe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain the world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or please humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain data and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident predictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to assist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI safety. In particular, our system can be employed as a guardrail against AI agents that might be created despite the risks involved. Ultimately, focusing on non-agentic AI may enable the benefits of AI innovation while avoiding the risks associated with the current trajectory. We hope these arguments will motivate researchers, developers, and policymakers to favor this safer path.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Unsupervised cross-domain Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training shows great potential for challenging continuous visual control but poses a big challenge. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{R}andom \textbf{P}re-\textbf{T}raining with \textbf{pro}totypes (CRPTpro), a novel, efficient, and effective self-supervised cross-domain RL pre-training framework. CRPTpro decouples data sampling from encoder pre-training, proposing decoupled random collection to easily and quickly generate a qualified cross-domain pre-training dataset. Moreover, a novel prototypical self-supervised algorithm is proposed to pre-train an effective visual encoder that is generic across different domains. Without finetuning, the cross-domain encoder can be implemented for challenging downstream tasks defined in different domains, either seen or unseen. Compared with recent advanced methods, CRPTpro achieves better performance on downstream policy learning without extra training on exploration agents for data collection, greatly reducing the burden of pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments across eight challenging continuous visual-control domains, including balance control, robot locomotion, and manipulation. CRPTpro significantly outperforms the next best Proto-RL(C) on 11/12 cross-domain downstream tasks with only 54.5\% wall-clock pre-training time,\footnote{Implementation: https://github.com/liuxin0824/CRPTpro} exhibiting state-of-the-art pre-training performance with greatly improved pre-training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting has remained a focal point due to its vital applications in sectors such as energy management and transportation planning. Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency. Our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive GNN-based models for time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Liang, Jintao Huang, Junyuan Hong, Dun Zeng, Jiayu Zhou, Zenglin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning has gained popularity for distributed learning without aggregating sensitive data from clients. But meanwhile, the distributed and isolated nature of data isolation may be complicated by data quality, making it more vulnerable to noisy labels. Many efforts exist to defend against the negative impacts of noisy labels in centralized or federated settings. However, there is a lack of a benchmark that comprehensively considers the impact of noisy labels in a wide variety of typical FL settings. In this work, we serve the first standardized benchmark that can help researchers fully explore potential federated noisy settings. Also, we conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the characteristics of these data settings and the comparison across baselines, which may guide method development in the future. We highlight the 20 basic settings for 6 datasets proposed in our benchmark and standardized simulation pipeline for federated noisy label learning, including implementations of 9 baselines. We hope this benchmark can facilitate idea verification in federated learning with noisy labels. \texttt{FedNoisy} is available at \codeword{https://github.com/SMILELab-FL/FedNoisy}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghanshyam Verma, Shovon Sengupta, Simon Simanta, Huan Chen, Janos A. Perge, Devishree Pillai, John P. McCrae, Paul Buitelaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized recommender systems play a crucial role in direct marketing, particularly in financial services, where delivering relevant content can enhance customer engagement and promote informed decision-making. This study explores interpretable knowledge graph (KG)-based recommender systems by proposing two distinct approaches for personalized article recommendations within a multinational financial services firm. The first approach leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to traverse a KG constructed from both structured (tabular) and unstructured (textual) data, enabling interpretability through Path Directed Reasoning (PDR). The second approach employs the XGBoost algorithm, with post-hoc explainability techniques such as SHAP and ELI5 to enhance transparency. By integrating machine learning with automatically generated KGs, our methods not only improve recommendation accuracy but also provide interpretable insights, facilitating more informed decision-making in customer relationship management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Gao, Shaohong Chen, Lei Wang, Ruiting Dai, Ziyun Zhang, Kerui Ren, Jiaji Wu, Jun Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in natural language processing, they still struggle with long-context comprehension. Traditional approaches to mitigating this issue typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining, which is both resource-intensive and challenging to deploy in lightweight industrial settings. In this paper, we investigate the potential to accomplish this without any additional resources. Through an in-depth study of the attention mechanism in LLMs, we propose a method called Scaled ReAttention (SRA) to strengthen LLMs' ability to interpret and retrieve information by strategically manipulating their attention scores during inference. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that integrating SRA significantly boosts LLMs' performance on a variety of downstream tasks, highlighting its practical potential for enhancing language understanding without incurring the overhead of traditional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Christian Nauen, Sebastian Palacio, Federico Raue, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers comes with a high computational cost because of their quadratic computational complexity, but their effectiveness in addressing problems in language and vision has sparked extensive research aimed at enhancing their efficiency. However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we perform a large-scale benchmark of more than 45 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. Our benchmark provides a standardized baseline for efficiency-oriented transformers. We analyze the results based on the Pareto front -- the boundary of optimal models. Surprisingly, despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting or developing efficient transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Ye, Zaixiang Zheng, Yu Bao, Lihua Qian, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge of generative AI has been fueled by the generative power of diffusion probabilistic models and the scalable capabilities of large language models. Despite their potential, it remains elusive whether diffusion language models can solve general language tasks comparable to their autoregressive counterparts. This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks. We further discover that instruction finetuning can elicit zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning abilities that help tackle many unseen tasks by following natural language instructions, and show promise in advanced and challenging abilities such as reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanjiang Cao, Quan Z. Sheng, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Generative AI has been a long-standing essential topic in the machine learning community, which can impact a number of application areas like text generation and computer vision. The major paradigm to train a generative model is maximum likelihood estimation, which pushes the learner to capture and approximate the target data distribution by decreasing the divergence between the model distribution and the target distribution. This formulation successfully establishes the objective of generative tasks, while it is incapable of satisfying all the requirements that a user might expect from a generative model. Reinforcement learning, serving as a competitive option to inject new training signals by creating new objectives that exploit novel signals, has demonstrated its power and flexibility to incorporate human inductive bias from multiple angles, such as adversarial learning, hand-designed rules and learned reward model to build a performant model. Thereby, reinforcement learning has become a trending research field and has stretched the limits of generative AI in both model design and application. It is reasonable to summarize and conclude advances in recent years with a comprehensive review. Although there are surveys in different application areas recently, this survey aims to shed light on a high-level review that spans a range of application areas. We provide a rigorous taxonomy in this area and make sufficient coverage on various models and applications. Notably, we also surveyed the fast-developing large language model area. We conclude this survey by showing the potential directions that might tackle the limit of current models and expand the frontiers for generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Wang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating responses based on human instructions. However, their use in the medical field can be challenging due to their lack of specific, in-depth knowledge. In this study, we present a system called LLMs Augmented with Medical Textbooks (LLM-AMT) designed to enhance the proficiency of LLMs in specialized domains. LLM-AMT integrates authoritative medical textbooks into the LLMs' framework using plug-and-play modules. These modules include a Query Augmenter, a Hybrid Textbook Retriever, and a Knowledge Self-Refiner. Together, they incorporate authoritative medical knowledge. Additionally, an LLM Reader aids in contextual understanding. Our experimental results on three medical QA tasks demonstrate that LLMAMT significantly improves response quality, with accuracy gains ranging from 11.6% to 16.6%. Notably, with GPT-4-Turbo as the base model, LLM-AMT outperforms the specialized Med-PaLM 2 model pre-trained on a massive amount of medical corpus by 2-3%. We found that despite being 100x smaller in size, medical textbooks as a retrieval corpus is proven to be a more effective knowledge database than Wikipedia in the medical domain, boosting performance by 7.8%-13.7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Wan, Nan Kang, Zeqing Wang, Zhuojie Yang, Liang Lin, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Visual Programming (VProg) has emerged as a significant framework for visual reasoning (VR) tasks due to its interpretability and cross-task generality. However, even with invoking powerful pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) as visual sub-modules, the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks is markedly inferior compared to well-trained task-specific networks. Although invoking task-specific models can further enhance the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks, it greatly diminishes the cross-task generalization ability of VProg. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VProg prevents direct fine-tuning on specific VR tasks for further performance improvement. Attempt to address these issues, we propose SDVP, a Stepwise Distillation learning strategy for non-differentiable VPorg across various VR tasks. Specifically, our SDVP stepwise distills the capabilities of existing, well-trained small task-specific models for decomposed visual sub-tasks in VProg into the much larger VLMs invoked by corresponding visual sub-modules. Besides, distilling the knowledge of little-size task-specific models into pre-trained larger VLMs rather than replacing them helps keep the cross-task abilities of VProgs. Extensive and comprehensive experimental results on different VProg frameworks demonstrate that our SDVP obtains significant performance gains on specific VR benchmarks, i.e., GQA (+2.4\%) and NLVRv2 (+6.2\%) for VisProg and GQA (+6.5\%) and NLVRv2 (+4.0\%) for ViperGPT, and also maintains a promising performance for VProg on unseen and previous VR tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhe Zhao, Anushtup Nandy, Howie Choset, Sivakumar Rathinam, Zhongqiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers a generalization of the Path Finding (PF) problem with refuelling constraints referred to as the Gas Station Problem (GSP). Similar to PF, given a graph where vertices are gas stations with known fuel prices, and edge costs are the gas consumption between the two vertices, GSP seeks a minimum-cost path from the start to the goal vertex for a robot with a limited gas tank and a limited number of refuelling stops. While GSP is polynomial-time solvable, it remains a challenge to quickly compute an optimal solution in practice since it requires simultaneously determine the path, where to make the stops, and the amount to refuel at each stop. This paper develops a heuristic search algorithm called Refuel A$^*$ (RF-A$^*$) that iteratively constructs partial solution paths from the start to the goal guided by a heuristic while leveraging dominance rules for pruning during planning. RF-A$^*$ is guaranteed to find an optimal solution and often runs 2 to 8 times faster than the existing approaches in large city maps with several hundreds of gas stations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liu, Yaran Chen, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Unsupervised skill discovery seeks to acquire different useful skills without extrinsic reward via unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL), with the discovered skills efficiently adapting to multiple downstream tasks in various ways. However, recent advanced skill discovery methods struggle to well balance state exploration and skill diversity, particularly when the potential skills are rich and hard to discern. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive dyna\textbf{m}ic \textbf{S}kill \textbf{D}iscovery \textbf{(ComSD)}\footnote{Code and videos: https://github.com/liuxin0824/ComSD} which generates diverse and exploratory unsupervised skills through a novel intrinsic incentive, named contrastive dynamic reward. It contains a particle-based exploration reward to make agents access far-reaching states for exploratory skill acquisition, and a novel contrastive diversity reward to promote the discriminability between different skills. Moreover, a novel dynamic weighting mechanism between the above two rewards is proposed to balance state exploration and skill diversity, which further enhances the quality of the discovered skills. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that ComSD can generate diverse behaviors at different exploratory levels for multi-joint robots, enabling state-of-the-art adaptation performance on challenging downstream tasks. It can also discover distinguishable and far-reaching exploration skills in the challenging tree-like 2D maze.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Zhang, Hao Zhu, Menglin Yang, Jiahong Liu, Rex Ying, Irwin King, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning generalizable self-supervised graph representations for downstream tasks is challenging. To this end, Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a leading approach. The embeddings of CL are arranged on a hypersphere where similarity is measured by the cosine distance. However, many real-world graphs, especially of hierarchical nature, cannot be embedded well in the Euclidean space. Although the hyperbolic embedding is suitable for hierarchical representation learning, naively applying CL to the hyperbolic space may result in the so-called dimension collapse, i.e., features will concentrate mostly within few density regions, leading to poor utilization of the whole feature space. Thus, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn high-quality graph embeddings in hyperbolic space. Specifically, we design the alignment metric that effectively captures the hierarchical data-invariant information, as well as we propose a substitute of the uniformity metric to prevent the so-called dimensional collapse. We show that in the hyperbolic space one has to address the leaf- and height-level uniformity related to properties of trees. In the ambient space of the hyperbolic manifold these notions translate into imposing an isotropic ring density towards boundaries of Poincar\'e ball. Our experiments support the efficacy of our method.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19786">From External to Swap Regret 2.0: An Efficient Reduction and Oblivious Adversary for Large Action Spaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuval Dagan, Constantinos Daskalakis, Maxwell Fishelson, Noah Golowich</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide a novel reduction from swap-regret minimization to external-regret minimization, which improves upon the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour [BM07] and Stolz-Lugosi [SL05] in that it does not require finiteness of the space of actions. We show that, whenever there exists a no-external-regret algorithm for some hypothesis class, there must also exist a no-swap-regret algorithm for that same class. For the problem of learning with expert advice, our result implies that it is possible to guarantee that the swap regret is bounded by {\epsilon} after $\log(N)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ rounds and with $O(N)$ per iteration complexity, where $N$ is the number of experts, while the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour and Stolz-Lugosi require $O(N/\epsilon^2)$ rounds and at least $\Omega(N^2)$ per iteration complexity. Our result comes with an associated lower bound, which -- in contrast to that in [BM07] -- holds for oblivious and $\ell_1$-constrained adversaries and learners that can employ distributions over experts, showing that the number of rounds must be $\tilde\Omega(N/\epsilon^2)$ or exponential in $1/\epsilon$.
  Our reduction implies that, if no-regret learning is possible in some game, then this game must have approximate correlated equilibria, of arbitrarily good approximation. This strengthens the folklore implication of no-regret learning that approximate coarse correlated equilibria exist. Importantly, it provides a sufficient condition for the existence of correlated equilibrium which vastly extends the requirement that the action set is finite, thus answering a question left open by [DG22; Ass+23]. Moreover, it answers several outstanding questions about equilibrium computation and learning in games.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the creative problem-solving capabilities of modern LLMs in a novel constrained setting. To this end, we create MACGYVER, an automatically generated dataset consisting of over 1,600 real-world problems deliberately designed to trigger innovative usage of objects and necessitate out-of-the-box thinking. We then present our collection to both LLMs and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. MACGYVER is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, LLMs, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physically-infeasible actions. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis of LLMs, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking.
  This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problem-solving capabilities of both humans and AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinandan Bose, Mihaela Curmei, Daniel L. Jiang, Jamie Morgenstern, Sarah Dean, Lillian J. Ratliff, Maryam Fazel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates ML systems serving a group of users, with multiple models/services, each aimed at specializing to a sub-group of users. We consider settings where upon deploying a set of services, users choose the one minimizing their personal losses and the learner iteratively learns by interacting with diverse users. Prior research shows that the outcomes of learning dynamics, which comprise both the services' adjustments and users' service selections, hinge significantly on the initialization. However, finding good initializations faces two main challenges: (i) Bandit feedback: Typically, data on user preferences are not available before deploying services and observing user behavior; (ii) Suboptimal local solutions: The total loss landscape (i.e., the sum of loss functions across all users and services) is not convex and gradient-based algorithms can get stuck in poor local minima.
  We address these challenges with a randomized algorithm to adaptively select a minimal set of users for data collection in order to initialize a set of services. Under mild assumptions on the loss functions, we prove that our initialization leads to a total loss within a factor of the globally optimal total loss with complete user preference data}, and this factor scales logarithmically in the number of services. This result is a generalization of the well-known $k$-means++ guarantee to a broad problem class, which is also of independent interest. The theory is complemented by experiments on real as well as semi-synthetic datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (GS) has emerged as a transformative technique in explicit radiance field and computer graphics. This innovative approach, characterized by the use of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in explicit radiance field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Zhu, Shuofei Qiao, Yixin Ou, Shumin Deng, Shiwei Lyu, Yue Shen, Lei Liang, Jinjie Gu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasushi Esaki, Satoshi Koide, Takuro Kutsuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain incremental learning (DIL) has been discussed in previous studies on deep neural network models for classification. In DIL, we assume that samples on new domains are observed over time. The models must classify inputs on all domains. In practice, however, we may encounter a situation where we need to perform DIL under the constraint that the samples on the new domain are observed only infrequently. Therefore, in this study, we consider the extreme case where we have only one sample from the new domain, which we call one-shot DIL. We first empirically show that existing DIL methods do not work well in one-shot DIL. We have analyzed the reason for this failure through various investigations. According to our analysis, we clarify that the difficulty of one-shot DIL is caused by the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Therefore, we propose a technique regarding these statistics and demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through experiments on open datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyuan Gao, Qizhi Pei, Gongbo Zhang, Jinhua Zhu, Kun He, Lijun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, these methods are often slow and costly. The advent of deep learning-based approaches has shown significant promise, offering increases in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an enhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and propose a novel methodology that significantly refines pocket prediction, thereby streamlining the docking process. Furthermore, we introduce modifications to the docking module to enhance its pose generation capabilities. In an effort to bridge the gap with conventional sampling/generative methods, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a confidence model, requiring only minor adjustments to the regression framework of FABind. Experimental results and analysis reveal that FABind+ remarkably outperforms the original FABind, achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance, and delivers insightful modeling strategies. This demonstrates FABind+ represents a substantial step forward in molecular docking and drug discovery. Our code is in https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabyasachi Sahoo, Mostafa ElAraby, Jonas Ngnawe, Yann Pequignot, Frederic Precioso, Christian Gagne</p>
<p>Abstract: Test Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses the problem of distribution shift by adapting a pretrained model to a new domain during inference. When faced with challenging shifts, most methods collapse and perform worse than the original pretrained model. In this paper, we find that not all layers are equally receptive to the adaptation, and the layers with the most misaligned gradients often cause performance degradation. To address this, we propose GALA, a novel layer selection criterion to identify the most beneficial updates to perform during test time adaptation. This criterion can also filter out unreliable samples with noisy gradients. Its simplicity allows seamless integration with existing TTA loss functions, thereby preventing degradation and focusing adaptation on the most trainable layers. This approach also helps to regularize adaptation to preserve the pretrained features, which are crucial for handling unseen domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed layer selection framework improves the performance of existing TTA approaches across multiple datasets, domain shifts, model architectures, and TTA losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Holliday, Ahmed El-Geneidy, Gregory Dudek</p>
<p>Abstract: Transit agencies world-wide face tightening budgets and declining ridership. To maintain quality of service while cutting costs, efficient transit network design is essential. But planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. The most successful approaches to date use metaheuristic algorithms to search through the space of possible transit networks by applying low-level heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these low-level heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper we use deep reinforcement learning with graph neural nets to learn low-level heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm, instead of designing them manually. These learned heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and achieve new state-of-the-art results the challenging Mumford benchmark. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by as much as 52% and 25% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 19% over the city's existing transit network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Gui, Zhen Li, Yao Wan, Yemin Shi, Hongyu Zhang, Yi Su, Bohua Chen, Dongping Chen, Siyuan Wu, Xing Zhou, Wenbin Jiang, Hai Jin, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically generating webpage code from webpage designs can significantly reduce the workload of front-end developers, and recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in this area. However, our investigation reveals that most existing MLLMs are constrained by the absence of high-quality, large-scale, real-world datasets, resulting in inadequate performance in automated webpage code generation. To fill this gap, this paper introduces WebCode2M, a new dataset comprising 2.56 million instances, each containing a design image along with the corresponding webpage code and layout details. Sourced from real-world web resources, WebCode2M offers a rich and valuable dataset for webpage code generation across a variety of applications. The dataset quality is ensured by a scoring model that filters out instances with aesthetic deficiencies or other incomplete elements. To validate the effectiveness of WebCode2M, we introduce a baseline model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT), named WebCoder, and establish a benchmark for fair comparison. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, TreeBLEU, to measure the structural hierarchy recall. The benchmarking results demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the ability of MLLMs to generate code from webpage designs, confirming its effectiveness and usability for future applications in front-end design tools. Finally, we highlight several practical challenges introduced by our dataset, calling for further research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Lei, Zixuan Wang, Yiqing Feng, Junru Zhang, Yahui Li, Chu Liu, Tongyao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent industrial credit scoring models remain heavily reliant on manually tuned statistical learning methods. While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impacted the writing process, enhancing productivity by collaborating with humans in content creation platforms. However, generating high-quality, user-aligned text to satisfy real-world content creation needs remains challenging. We propose WritingPath, a framework that uses explicit outlines to guide LLMs in generating goal-oriented, high-quality text. Our approach draws inspiration from structured writing planning and reasoning paths, focusing on reflecting user intentions throughout the writing process. To validate our approach in real-world scenarios, we construct a diverse dataset from unstructured blog posts to benchmark writing performance and introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing the quality of outlines and generated texts. Our evaluations with various LLMs demonstrate that the WritingPath approach significantly enhances text quality according to evaluations by both LLMs and professional writers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Tam Sobeih, Lianghao Han, Darren Dancey</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation is a critical task in computer vision, with applications in autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Event cameras, which encode temporal changes in light intensity as asynchronous binary spikes, offer unique advantages such as low latency, high dynamic range, and energy efficiency. However, their unconventional spiking output and the scarcity of labelled datasets pose significant challenges to traditional image-based depth estimation methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel energy-efficient Spike-Driven Transformer Network (SDT) for depth estimation, leveraging the unique properties of spiking data. The proposed SDT introduces three key innovations: (1) a purely spike-driven transformer architecture that incorporates spike-based attention and residual mechanisms, enabling precise depth estimation with minimal energy consumption; (2) a fusion depth estimation head that combines multi-stage features for fine-grained depth prediction while ensuring computational efficiency; and (3) a cross-modality knowledge distillation framework that utilises a pre-trained vision foundation model (DINOv2) to enhance the training of the spiking network despite limited data availability.This work represents the first exploration of transformer-based spiking neural networks for depth estimation, providing a significant step forward in energy-efficient neuromorphic computing for real-world vision applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems primarily focus on the vehicle directly ahead, often overlooking potential risks from following vehicles. This oversight can lead to ineffective handling of high risk situations, such as high speed, closely spaced, multi vehicle scenarios where emergency braking by one vehicle might trigger a pile up collision. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning based algorithm for longitudinal control and collision avoidance. This proposed algorithm effectively considers the behavior of both leading and following vehicles. Its implementation in simulated high risk scenarios, which involve emergency braking in dense traffic where traditional systems typically fail, has demonstrated the algorithm ability to prevent potential pile up collisions, including those involving heavy duty vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandr Nikolich, Konstantin Korolev, Sergei Bratchikov, Igor Kiselev, Artem Shelmanov</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a surge in developing various Large Language Models (LLMs). However, text generation for languages other than English often faces significant challenges, including poor generation quality and reduced computational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens in the model's vocabulary. In this work, we address these issues by developing a pipeline for adapting English-oriented pre-trained models to other languages and constructing efficient bilingual LLMs. Using this pipeline, we construct Vikhr, a state-of-the-art bilingual open-source instruction-following LLM designed specifically for the Russian language. "Vikhr" refers to the name of the Mistral LLM series and means a "strong gust of wind." Unlike previous Russian-language models that typically rely on LoRA adapters on top of English-oriented models, sacrificing performance for lower training costs, Vikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes continued pre-training and instruction tuning of all weights. This not only enhances the model's performance but also significantly improves its computational and contextual efficiency. The remarkable performance of Vikhr across various Russian-language benchmarks can also be attributed to our efforts in expanding instruction datasets and corpora for continued pre-training. Vikhr not only sets a new state of the art among open-source LLMs for Russian but even outperforms some proprietary closed-source models on certain benchmarks. The model weights, instruction sets, and code are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent introduction of the Assistants API highlights its potential for large language models (LLMs) in role-playing agents (RPA). However, maintaining consistent character personas remains a significant challenge due to variability in information extraction, which frequently omits critical elements such as backstory or interpersonal relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce CharacterGPT, a framework designed to dynamically reconstruct character personas through Character Persona Training (CPT). This approach incrementally updates personas by extracting traits from chapter-wise novel summaries, reflecting the progression of the narrative. Our framework is evaluated through Big Five personality evaluations and creative tasks, in which characters generate original narratives, demonstrating the efficacy of CharacterGPT in preserving persona consistency.

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) technology has changed our role in interacting with these models. Instead of primarily testing these models with questions we already know answers to, we are now using them for queries where the answers are unknown to us, driven by human curiosity. This shift highlights the growing need to understand curiosity-driven human questions - those that are more complex, open-ended, and reflective of real-world needs. To this end, we present Quriosity, a collection of 13.5K naturally occurring questions from three diverse sources: human-to-search-engine queries, human-to-human interactions, and human-to-LLM conversations. Our comprehensive collection enables a rich understanding of human curiosity across various domains and contexts. Our analysis reveals a significant presence of causal questions (up to 42%) in the dataset, for which we develop an iterative prompt improvement framework to identify all causal queries and examine their unique linguistic properties, cognitive complexity and source distribution. Our paper paves the way for future work on causal question identification and open-ended chatbot interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhong Zheng, Elisa Tsai, Yifu Lu, Jiachen Sun, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Atul Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality human-annotated data is crucial for modern deep learning pipelines, yet the human annotation process is both costly and time-consuming. Given a constrained human labeling budget, selecting an informative and representative data subset for labeling can significantly reduce human annotation effort. Well-performing state-of-the-art (SOTA) coreset selection methods require ground truth labels over the whole dataset, failing to reduce the human labeling burden. Meanwhile, SOTA label-free coreset selection methods deliver inferior performance due to poor geometry-based difficulty scores. In this paper, we introduce ELFS (Effective Label-Free Coreset Selection), a novel label-free coreset selection method. ELFS significantly improves label-free coreset selection by addressing two challenges: 1) ELFS utilizes deep clustering to estimate training dynamics-based data difficulty scores without ground truth labels; 2) Pseudo-labels introduce a distribution shift in the data difficulty scores, and we propose a simple but effective double-end pruning method to mitigate bias on calculated scores. We evaluate ELFS on four vision benchmarks and show that, given the same vision encoder, ELFS consistently outperforms SOTA label-free baselines. For instance, when using SwAV as the encoder, ELFS outperforms D2 by up to 10.2% in accuracy on ImageNet-1K. We make our code publicly available on GitHub.</p>

We observe these groupings exhibit within-cluster organization (such as hierarchies, topological ordering, etc.), hypothesizing a fundamental structure that precedes contextual processing. To further investigate the conceptual nature of these groupings, we explore cross-model alignments across different LLM categories within their input embeddings, observing a medium to high degree of alignment. Furthermore, provide evidence that manipulating these groupings can play a functional role in mitigating ethnicity bias in LLM tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijin Hong, Zheng Yuan, Qinggang Zhang, Hao Chen, Junnan Dong, Feiran Huang, Xiao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating accurate SQL from users' natural language questions (text-to-SQL) remains a long-standing challenge due to the complexities involved in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restricts the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. Subsequently, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we make a summarization and discuss the remaining challenges in this field and suggest expectations for future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantinos Daskalakis, Noah Golowich</p>
<p>Abstract: The empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle has been highly impactful in machine learning, leading both to near-optimal theoretical guarantees for ERM-based learning algorithms as well as driving many of the recent empirical successes in deep learning. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether the ability to perform ERM, which computes a hypothesis minimizing empirical risk on a given dataset, is necessary for efficient learning: in particular, is there a weaker oracle than ERM which can nevertheless enable learnability? We answer this question affirmatively, showing that in the realizable setting of PAC learning for binary classification, a concept class can be learned using an oracle which only returns a single bit indicating whether a given dataset is realizable by some concept in the class. The sample complexity and oracle complexity of our algorithm depend polynomially on the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, thus showing that there is only a polynomial price to pay for use of our weaker oracle. Our results extend to the agnostic learning setting with a slight strengthening of the oracle, as well as to the partial concept, multiclass and real-valued learning settings. In the setting of partial concept classes, prior to our work no oracle-efficient algorithms were known, even with a standard ERM oracle. Thus, our results address a question of Alon et al. (2021) who asked whether there are algorithmic principles which enable efficient learnability in this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulai Zhao, Masatoshi Uehara, Gabriele Scalia, Sunyuan Kung, Tommaso Biancalani, Sergey Levine, Ehsan Hajiramezanali</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models that allow for precise control over the characteristics of the generated samples. While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoyl18/CTRL.</p>

To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignat Georgiev, Varun Giridhar, Nicklas Hansen, Animesh Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in complex tasks but struggles in multi-task settings with different embodiments. World model methods offer scalability by learning a simulation of the environment but often rely on inefficient gradient-free optimization methods for policy extraction. In contrast, gradient-based methods exhibit lower variance but fail to handle discontinuities. Our work reveals that well-regularized world models can generate smoother optimization landscapes than the actual dynamics, facilitating more effective first-order optimization. We introduce Policy learning with multi-task World Models (PWM), a novel model-based RL algorithm for continuous control. Initially, the world model is pre-trained on offline data, and then policies are extracted from it using first-order optimization in less than 10 minutes per task. PWM effectively solves tasks with up to 152 action dimensions and outperforms methods that use ground-truth dynamics. Additionally, PWM scales to an 80-task setting, achieving up to 27% higher rewards than existing baselines without relying on costly online planning.

<p>Abstract: Dialogue agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show superior performance in various tasks. Despite the better user understanding and human-like responses, their lack of controllability remains a key challenge, often leading to unfocused conversations or task failure. To address this, we introduce Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to regulate dialogue flow. Specifically, we propose ChatSOP, a novel SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning framework designed to enhance the controllability of LLM-driven dialogue agents. To enable this, we curate a dataset comprising SOP-annotated multi-scenario dialogues, generated using a semi-automated role-playing system with GPT-4o and validated through strict manual quality control. Additionally, we propose a novel method that integrates Chain of Thought reasoning with supervised fine-tuning for SOP prediction and utilizes SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimal action planning during dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, such as achieving a 27.95% improvement in action accuracy compared to baseline models based on GPT-3.5 and also showing notable gains for open-source models. Dataset and codes are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Yoffe, Alfonso Amayuelas, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debates have been introduced to improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by having multiple agents discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, models often generate incorrect yet confident-sounding responses, which can mislead others. This issue arises partly because agents do not consider how confident their peers are. To address this, we propose DebUnc, a debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence. Confidence is then conveyed through a modified attention mechanism that adjusts token weights, or through textual prompts. Evaluations across benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective and that performance continues to improve as uncertainty estimation becomes more reliable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Fayyazi, Mehdi Kamal, Massoud Pedram</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Dynamic Co-Optimization Compiler (DCOC), which employs an adaptive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to enhance the efficiency of mapping machine learning (ML) models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), onto diverse hardware platforms. DCOC incorporates three specialized actor-critic agents within MARL, each dedicated to different optimization facets: one for hardware and two for software. This cooperative strategy results in an integrated hardware/software co-optimization approach, improving the precision and speed of DNN deployments. By focusing on high-confidence configurations, DCOC effectively reduces the search space, achieving remarkable performance over existing methods. Our results demonstrate that DCOC enhances throughput by up to 37.95% while reducing optimization time by up to 42.2% across various DNN models, outperforming current state-of-the-art frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sixiao Zheng, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual storytelling involves generating a sequence of coherent frames from a textual storyline while maintaining consistency in characters and scenes. Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for visual storytelling. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduce a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding, and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding the model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in both story visualization and continuation.

Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of QT. I demonstrate the ability of QT-DNN to recognise optical illusions like a human. Tasking QT-DNN to simulate human perception of the Necker cube and Rubin's vase, I provide arguments in favour of the superiority of QT-based activation functions over the activation functions optimised for modern applications in machine vision, also showing that, at the fundamental level, QT-DNN is closely related to biology-inspired DNNs and models based on the principles of quantum information processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in a wide array of natural language processing tasks. However, its effectiveness over discourse-level event relation extraction (ERE) tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Tang, Ye Liu, Xi Zhao, Xukai Liu, Yanghai Zhang, Kai Zhang, Xiaofang Zhou, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Jeanselme, Chang Ho Yoon, Fabian Falck, Brian Tom, Jessica Barrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying patient subgroups with different treatment responses is an important task to inform medical recommendations, guidelines, and the design of future clinical trials. Existing approaches for treatment effect estimation primarily rely on Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), which are often limited by insufficient power, multiple comparisons, and unbalanced covariates. In addition, RCTs tend to feature more homogeneous patient groups, making them less relevant for uncovering subgroups in the population encountered in real-world clinical practice. Subgroup analyses established for RCTs suffer from significant statistical biases when applied to observational studies, which benefit from larger and more representative populations. Our work introduces a novel, outcome-guided, subgroup analysis strategy for identifying subgroups of treatment response in both RCTs and observational studies alike. It hence positions itself in-between individualised and average treatment effect estimation to uncover patient subgroups with distinct treatment responses, critical for actionable insights that may influence treatment guidelines. In experiments, our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method for subgroup analysis in both randomised and observational treatment regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yorick Sens, Henriette Knopp, Sven Peldszus, Thorsten Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of machine learning (ML) and its integration into software systems has drastically changed development practices. While software engineering traditionally focused on manually created code artifacts with dedicated processes and architectures, ML-enabled systems require additional data-science methods and tools to create ML artifacts -- especially ML models and training data. However, integrating models into systems, and managing the many different artifacts involved, is far from trivial. ML-enabled systems can easily have multiple ML models that interact with each other and with traditional code in intricate ways. Unfortunately, while challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems have been studied, little is known about the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems beyond isolated examples. Improving engineering processes and architectures for ML-enabled systems requires improving the empirical understanding of these systems. We present a large-scale study of 2,928 open-source ML-enabled software systems. We classified and analyzed them to determine system characteristics, model and code reuse practices, and architectural aspects of integrating ML models. Our findings show that these systems still mainly consist of traditional source code, and that ML model reuse through code duplication or pre-trained models is common. We also identified different ML integration patterns and related implementation practices. We hope that our results help improve practices for integrating ML models, bringing data science and software engineering closer together.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinluan Yang, Zhengyu Chen, Teng Xiao, Wenqiao Zhang, Yong Lin, Kun Kuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results for semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs. Notably, most real-world heterophilic graphs are composed of a mixture of nodes with different neighbor patterns, exhibiting local node-level homophilic and heterophilic structures. However, existing works are only devoted to designing better HGNN backbones or architectures for node classification tasks on heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks simultaneously, and their analyses of HGNN performance with respect to nodes are only based on the determined data distribution without exploring the effect caused by this structural difference between training and testing nodes. How to learn invariant node representations on heterophilic graphs to handle this structure difference or distribution shifts remains unexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of previous graph-based invariant learning methods from the perspective of data augmentation. Then, we propose \textbf{HEI}, a framework capable of generating invariant node representations through incorporating heterophily information to infer latent environments without augmentation, which are then used for invariant prediction, under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. We theoretically show that our proposed method can achieve guaranteed performance under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and backbones can also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.

While feature engineering was historically addressed by carefully hand-crafting data representations based on domain expertise, deep neural networks (DNNs) now offer a radically different approach. DNNs implicitly engineer features by transforming their input data into hidden feature vectors called embeddings. For embedding vectors produced by foundation models -- which are trained to be useful across many contexts -- we demonstrate that simple and well-studied dimensionality-reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis uncover inherent heterogeneity in input data concordant with human-understandable explanations. Of the many applications for this framework, we find empirical evidence that there is intrinsic separability between real samples and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation. However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures. Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in natural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify societal biases, particularly those related to gender. In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs. However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs. Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2%. By offering a realistic assessment and tailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent a significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs. More details are available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting cracks with pixel-level precision for key structures is a significant challenge, existing methods struggle to integrate local textures and pixel dependencies of cracks. Furthermore, these methods possess numerous parameters and substantial computational requirements, complicating deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we propose the Staircase Cascaded Fusion Crack Segmentation Network (CrackSCF), which generates high-quality crack segmentation maps while reducing computational overhead. We design a lightweight convolutional block that substitutes all convolution operations, reducing the model's computational demands while maintaining an effective capture of local details. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight long-range dependency extractor to better capture the long-range dependencies. Furthermore, we develop a staircase cascaded fusion module, which seamlessly integrates local patterns and long-range dependencies, resulting in high-quality segmentation maps. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we created the challenging TUT benchmark dataset and evaluated it alongside five other public datasets. The results show that our method outperforms existing methods, particularly in handling background noise and achieving detailed segmentation. The F1 and mIoU scores on the TUT dataset are 0.8382 and 0.8473, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with low computational resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Hanzi Mao, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Yao, Wentao He, Chenyu Gu, Jiaheng Du, Fuwei Tan, Zhen Zhu, Junguo Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjun Luo, Yingbin Jin, Xinfeng Li, Xuecheng Liu, Ruizhe Chen, Tong Shang, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more researchers apply LLMs for Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods, bringing vitality to this classical Natural Language Processing task. However, existing datasets are designed for traditional machine learning methods, inadequate for LLM-based methods in terms of corpus selection, entity categorization, and design logic. This limitation leads to less effective evaluation and model fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose DynamicNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs and with dynamic categorization, transcending the limitations of fixed categorization in existing datasets. It is also multi-lingual and multi-granular, covering 8 languages and 155 entity types, with corpus spanning multiple specialized domains. Furthermore, in response to the limitations demonstrated by existing LLM-based methods during DynamicNER testing, we develop CascadeNER, a novel NER method based on a two-stage strategy and lightweight LLMs, addressing the problems in current methods. Experiments show that DynamicNER is an effective benchmark for LLM-based NER methods, and CascadeNER outperforms existing methods with fewer computational resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Zhou, Mingsi Wang, Tianlin Li, Guozhu Meng, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pose-driven human image animation has achieved tremendous progress, enabling the generation of vivid and realistic human videos from just one single photo. However, it conversely exacerbates the risk of image misuse, as attackers may use one available image to create videos involving politics, violence, and other illegal content. To counter this threat, we propose Dormant, a novel protection approach tailored to defend against pose-driven human image animation techniques. Dormant applies protective perturbation to one human image, preserving the visual similarity to the original but resulting in poor-quality video generation. The protective perturbation is optimized to induce misextraction of appearance features from the image and create incoherence among the generated video frames. Our extensive evaluation across 8 animation methods and 4 datasets demonstrates the superiority of Dormant over 6 baseline protection methods, leading to misaligned identities, visual distortions, noticeable artifacts, and inconsistent frames in the generated videos. Moreover, Dormant shows effectiveness on 6 real-world commercial services, even with fully black-box access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueluan Gong, Mingzhe Li, Yilin Zhang, Fengyuan Ran, Chen Chen, Yanjiao Chen, Qian Wang, Kwok-Yan Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melis Ilayda Bal, Pier Giuseppe Sessa, Mojmir Mutny, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Sky Li, Weize Chen, Qizhi Chu, Haopeng Li, Zhaojun Sun, Ran Li, Chen Qian, Yiwei Wei, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun, Cheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The need to analyze graphs is ubiquitous across various fields, from social networks to biological research and recommendation systems. Therefore, enabling the ability of large language models (LLMs) to process graphs is an important step toward more advanced general intelligence. However, current LLM benchmarks on graph analysis require models to directly reason over the prompts describing graph topology, and are thus limited to small graphs with only a few dozens of nodes. In contrast, human experts typically write programs based on popular libraries for task solving, and can thus handle graphs with different scales. To this end, a question naturally arises: can LLMs analyze graphs like professionals? In this paper, we introduce ProGraph, a manually crafted benchmark containing 3 categories of graph tasks. The benchmark expects solutions based on programming instead of directly reasoning over raw inputs. Our findings reveal that the performance of current LLMs is unsatisfactory, with the best model achieving only 36% accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose LLM4Graph datasets, which include crawled documents and auto-generated codes based on 6 widely used graph libraries. By augmenting closed-source LLMs with document retrieval and fine-tuning open-source ones on the codes, we show 11-32% absolute improvements in their accuracies. Our results underscore that the capabilities of LLMs in handling structured data are still under-explored, and show the effectiveness of LLM4Graph in enhancing LLMs' proficiency of graph analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Bjorck, Alon Benhaim, Vishrav Chaudhary, Furu Wei, Xia Song</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art LLMs are powered by scaling -- scaling model size, dataset size and cluster size. It is economically infeasible to extensively tune hyperparameter for the largest runs. Instead, approximately optimal hyperparameters must be inferred or \textit{transferred} from smaller experiments. Hyperparameter transfer across model sizes has been studied in Yang et al. However, hyperparameter transfer across dataset size -- or token horizon -- has not been studied yet. To remedy this we conduct a large scale empirical study on how optimal learning rate (LR) depends on token horizon in LLM training. We first demonstrate that the optimal LR changes significantly with token horizon -- longer training necessitates smaller LR. Secondly we demonstrate the the optimal LR follows a scaling law, and that the optimal LR for longer horizons can be accurately estimated from shorter horizons via such scaling laws. We also provide a rule-of-thumb for transferring LR across token horizons with zero overhead over current practices. Lastly we provide evidence that LLama-1 used too high LR, and estimate the performance hit from this. We thus argue that hyperparameter transfer across data size is an important and overlooked component of LLM training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Zeqi Tan, Sihao Shen, Weiming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social intelligence is built upon three foundational pillars: cognitive intelligence, situational intelligence, and behavioral intelligence. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our social lives, understanding, evaluating, and developing their social intelligence are becoming increasingly important. While multiple existing works have investigated the social intelligence of LLMs, (1) most focus on a specific aspect, and the social intelligence of LLMs has yet to be systematically organized and studied; (2) position LLMs as passive observers from a third-person perspective, such as in Theory of Mind (ToM) tests. Compared to the third-person perspective, ego-centric first-person perspective evaluation can align well with actual LLM-based Agent use scenarios. (3) a lack of comprehensive evaluation of behavioral intelligence, with specific emphasis on incorporating critical human-machine interaction scenarios. In light of this, we present EgoSocialArena, a novel framework grounded in the three pillars of social intelligence: cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence, aimed to systematically evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs from a first-person perspective. With EgoSocialArena, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight prominent foundation models, even the most advanced LLMs like O1-preview lag behind human performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawisorn Kamtue, Jose M. F. Moura, Orathai Sangpetch</p>
<p>Abstract: Can neural networks solve math problems using first a principle alone? This paper shows how to leverage the fundamental theorem of the calculus of variations to design deep neural networks to solve functional optimization without requiring training data (e.g., ground-truth optimal solutions). Our approach is particularly crucial when the solution is a function defined over an unknown interval or support\textemdash such as in minimum-time control problems. By incorporating the necessary conditions satisfied by the optimal function solution, as derived from the calculus of variation, in the design of the deep architecture, CalVNet leverages overparameterized neural networks to learn these optimal functions directly. We validate CalVNet by showing that, without relying on ground-truth data and simply incorporating first principles, it successfully derives the Kalman filter for linear filtering, the bang-bang optimal control for minimum-time problems, and finds geodesics on manifolds. Our results demonstrate that CalVNet can be trained in an unsupervised manner, without relying on ground-truth data, establishing a promising framework for addressing general, potentially unsolved functional optimization problems that still lack analytical solutions.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06287">Non-Halting Queries: Exploiting Fixed Points in LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghaith Hammouri, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new vulnerability that exploits fixed points in autoregressive models and use it to craft queries that never halt. More precisely, for non-halting queries, the LLM never samples the end-of-string token <eos>. We rigorously analyze the conditions under which the non-halting anomaly presents itself. In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating (cyclic) token sequence is observed at the output beyond the context size, then the LLM does not halt.
  We demonstrate non-halting queries in many experiments performed in base unaligned models where repeating prompts immediately lead to a non-halting cyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple recipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates a prompt structure to target aligned models. We demonstrate the recipe's success in sending every major model released over the past year into a non-halting state with the same simple prompt even over higher temperatures. Further, we devise an experiment with 100 randomly selected tokens and show that the recipe to create non-halting queries succeeds with high success rates ranging from 97% for GPT-4o to 19% for Gemini Pro 1.5. These results show that the proposed adversarial recipe succeeds in bypassing alignment at one to two orders of magnitude higher rates compared to earlier reports.
  We also study gradient-based direct inversion using ARCA to craft new short prompts to induce the non-halting state. We inverted 10,000 random repeating 2-cycle outputs for llama-3.1-8b-instruct. Out of 10,000 three-token inverted prompts 1,512 yield non-halting queries reaching a rate of 15%. Our experiments with ARCA show that non-halting may be easily induced with as few as 3 input tokens with high probability. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that non-halting queries are prevalent and relatively easy to find.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tool learning enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly expanding the application scope of LLMs. However, due to the dynamic nature of external environments, these tools and APIs may become outdated over time, preventing LLMs from correctly invoking tools. Existing research primarily focuses on static environments and overlooks this issue, limiting the adaptability of LLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ToolEVO, a novel framework designed to enhance the adaptive and reflective capabilities of LLMs against tool variability. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, ToolEVO facilitates active exploration and interaction of LLMs within dynamic environments, allowing for autonomous self-reflection and self-updating of tool usage based on environmental feedback. Additionally, we introduce ToolQA-D, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of tool variability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach, highlighting the importance of adaptability to tool variability for effective tool learning.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorfBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorfEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximus Powers, Umang Mavani, Harshitha Reddy Jonala, Ansh Tiwari, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of social bias in text is a critical challenge, particularly due to the limitations of binary classification methods. These methods often oversimplify nuanced biases, leading to high emotional impact when content is misclassified as either "biased" or "fair." To address these shortcomings, we propose a more nuanced framework that focuses on three key linguistic components underlying social bias: Generalizations, Unfairness, and Stereotypes (the GUS framework). The GUS framework employs a semi-automated approach to create a comprehensive synthetic dataset, which is then verified by humans to maintain ethical standards. This dataset enables robust multi-label token classification. Our methodology, which combines discriminative (encoder-only) models and generative (auto-regressive large language models), identifies biased entities in text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that encoder-only models are effective for this complex task, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of macro and entity-wise F1-score and Hamming loss. These findings can guide the choice of model for different use cases, highlighting the GUS framework's effectiveness in capturing explicit and implicit biases across diverse contexts, and offering a pathway for future research and applications in various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weinan Zhang, Junwei Liao, Ning Li, Kounianhua Du, Jianghao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the 1970s, information retrieval (IR) has long been defined as the process of acquiring relevant information items from a pre-defined corpus to satisfy user information needs. Traditional IR systems, while effective in domains like web search, are constrained by their reliance on static, pre-defined information items. To this end, this paper introduces agentic information retrieval (Agentic IR), a transformative next-generation paradigm for IR driven by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. The central shift in agentic IR is the evolving definition of ``information'' from static, pre-defined information items to dynamic, context-dependent information states. Information state refers to a particular information context that the user is right in within a dynamic environment, encompassing not only the acquired information items but also real-time user preferences, contextual factors, and decision-making processes. In such a way, traditional information retrieval, focused on acquiring relevant information items based on user queries, can be naturally extended to achieving the target information state given the user instruction, which thereby defines the agentic information retrieval. We systematically discuss agentic IR from various aspects, i.e., task formulation, architecture, evaluation, case studies, as well as challenges and future prospects. We believe that the concept of agentic IR introduced in this paper not only broadens the scope of information retrieval research but also lays the foundation for a more adaptive, interactive, and intelligent next-generation IR paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Chen, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, but their performance on long-context tasks is often limited by the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach to accelerate attention computation in LLMs, particularly for long-context scenarios. We leverage the inherent sparsity within attention mechanisms, both in conventional Softmax attention and ReLU attention (with $\mathsf{ReLU}^\alpha$ activation, $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}_+$), to significantly reduce the running time complexity. Our method employs a Half-Space Reporting (HSR) data structure to identify non-zero or ``massively activated'' entries in the attention matrix. We present theoretical analyses for two key scenarios: generation decoding and prompt prefilling. Our approach achieves a running time of $O(mn^{4/5})$ significantly faster than the naive approach $O(mn)$ for generation decoding, where $n$ is the context length, $m$ is the query length, and $d$ is the hidden dimension. We can also reduce the running time for prompt prefilling from $O(mn)$ to $O(mn^{1 - 1 / \lfloor d/2\rfloor} + mn^{4/5})$. Our method introduces only provably negligible error for Softmax attention. This work represents a significant step towards enabling efficient long-context processing in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Zhu, Haizhou Shi, Xiaotang Wang, Yongchao Liu, Yaoke Wang, Boci Peng, Chuntao Hong, Siliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, research on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has gained significant attention due to the prevalence of free-text node features in real-world applications and the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that bolster TAG methodologies. However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Wang, Xiang Chen, Ningyu Zhang, Bozhong Tian, Haoming Xu, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs DeCo, which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Yang, Zheng Chen, Xin Liu, Rikuto Kotoge, Peng Chen, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving gene functional networks from knowledge databases presents a challenge due to the mismatch between disease networks and subtype-specific variations. Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods, often fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases or explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we propose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting gene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes. Graphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific networks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three modules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from patient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures representations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring accurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two representations using an inference loss that leverages graph generation capabilities, conditioned on the patient separation loss, to refine subtype-specific information in the learned representation. GeSubNet consistently outperforms traditional methods, with average improvements of 30.6%, 21.0%, 20.1%, and 56.6% across four graph evaluation metrics, averaged over four cancer datasets. Particularly, we conduct a biological simulation experiment to assess how the behavior of selected genes from over 11,000 candidates affects subtypes or patient distributions. The results show that the generated network has the potential to identify subtype-specific genes with an 83% likelihood of impacting patient distribution shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhong Zhou, Haiyang Yu, Xinghua Zhang, Rongwu Xu, Fei Huang, Kun Wang, Yang Liu, Junfeng Fang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple language tasks, yet their safety guardrails can be circumvented, leading to harmful generations. In light of this, recent research on safety mechanisms has emerged, revealing that when safety representations or component are suppressed, the safety capability of LLMs are compromised. However, existing research tends to overlook the safety impact of multi-head attention mechanisms, despite their crucial role in various model functionalities. Hence, in this paper, we aim to explore the connection between standard attention mechanisms and safety capability to fill this gap in the safety-related mechanistic interpretability. We propose a novel metric which tailored for multi-head attention, the Safety Head ImPortant Score (Ships), to assess the individual heads' contributions to model safety. Based on this, we generalize Ships to the dataset level and further introduce the Safety Attention Head AttRibution Algorithm (Sahara) to attribute the critical safety attention heads inside the model. Our findings show that the special attention head has a significant impact on safety. Ablating a single safety head allows aligned model (e.g., Llama-2-7b-chat) to respond to 16 times more harmful queries, while only modifying 0.006% of the parameters, in contrast to the ~ 5% modification required in previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate that attention heads primarily function as feature extractors for safety and models fine-tuned from the same base model exhibit overlapping safety heads through comprehensive experiments. Together, our attribution approach and findings provide a novel perspective for unpacking the black box of safety mechanisms within large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Haduong (Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington), Noah A. Smith (Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence)</p>
<p>Abstract: Many domains now employ AI-based decision-making aids, and although the potential for AI systems to assist with decision making is much discussed, human-AI collaboration often underperforms due to factors such as (mis)trust in the AI system and beliefs about AI being incapable of completing subjective tasks. One potential tool for influencing human decision making is performance pressure, which hasn't been much studied in interaction with human-AI decision making. In this work, we examine how pressure and explainable AI (XAI) techniques interact with AI advice-taking behavior. Using an inherently low-stakes task (spam review classification), we demonstrate effective and simple methods to apply pressure and influence human AI advice-taking behavior by manipulating financial incentives and imposing time limits. Our results show complex interaction effects, with different combinations of pressure and XAI techniques either improving or worsening AI advice taking behavior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these interactions, strategies to effectively use pressure, and encourage future research to incorporate pressure analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Wilcoxson, Qiyang Li, Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled offline trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-labels unlabeled trajectories with optimistic rewards and high-level action labels, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples that encourage novelty-seeking behavior. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. In our experiments, SUPE consistently outperforms prior strategies across a suite of 42 long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nithin Somasekharan, Shaowu Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we re-formulate the model compression problem into the customized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, we aim to introduce residual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customized requirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greater flexibility in balancing accuracy and overhead(inference and model size) without being bound to fixed compression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs more flexibly. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/EoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minheng Chen, Chao Cao, Tong Chen, Yan Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Yanjun Lyu, Xiaowei Yu, Lu Zhang, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) is a newly defined folding pattern, which is the conjunction of gyri coming from three directions in cortical folding. Many studies demonstrated that 3HGs can be reliable nodes when constructing brain networks or connectome since they simultaneously possess commonality and individuality across different individual brains and populations. However, 3HGs are identified and validated within individual spaces, making it difficult to directly serve as the brain network nodes due to the absence of cross-subject correspondence. The 3HG correspondences represent the intrinsic regulation of brain organizational architecture, traditional image-based registration methods tend to fail because individual anatomical properties need to be fully respected. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for anatomical feature embedding of the 3HGs to build the correspondences among different brains. The core component of this framework is to construct a structural similarity-enhanced multi-hop feature encoding strategy based on the recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for anatomical feature embedding. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can effectively establish robust cross-subject correspondences when no one-to-one mapping exists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengke Zou, Xingang Guo, Rui Yang, Junyu Zhang, Bin Hu, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Blouir, Jimmy T. H. Smith, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Amarda Shehu</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient state space models (SSMs), such as linear recurrent neural networks and linear attention variants, offer computational advantages over Transformers but struggle with tasks requiring long-range in-context retrieval-like text copying, associative recall, and question answering over long contexts. Previous efforts to address these challenges have focused on architectural modifications, often reintroducing computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the in-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture. Our approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of specialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We introduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from bidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling. This narrows the performance gap with Transformers, while retaining computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of training procedures in leveraging the fixed-state capacity of SSMs, offering a new direction to advance their capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcus Williams, Micah Carroll, Adhyyan Narang, Constantin Weisser, Brendan Murphy, Anca Dragan</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eldar Kurtic, Alexandre Marques, Shubhra Pandit, Mark Kurtz, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is a powerful tool for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, but the accuracy-performance trade-offs across different formats remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct the most comprehensive empirical study to date, evaluating FP8, INT8, and INT4 quantization across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Through over 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1) FP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned INT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\%) accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit quantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for different deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular vLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16 is the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in asynchronous continuous batching. For mixed workloads, the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Our findings offer practical, data-driven guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs at scale -- ensuring the best balance between speed, efficiency, and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jimmy Lin, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhuo, Ya Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaoqing Li, Xun Zhou, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

Non-auto-regressive methods could be an alternative but often produce degenerate outputs and exhibit shortcomings in conditional generation. To address these challenges, we propose Diffusion-EAGS, a novel framework that integrates conditional masked language models into diffusion language models through the theoretical lens of a conditional Markov Random Field. In doing so, we propose entropy-adaptive Gibbs sampling and entropy-based noise scheduling to counterbalance each model's shortcomings. Experimental results show that Diffusion-EAGS outperforms baselines and achieves the best quality-diversity tradeoff, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-autoregressive text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Liu, Jirui Qi, Paul He, Arianna Bisazza, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation are easily influenced by the order, in which the retrieved documents are presented to the model when solving tasks such as question answering (QA). However, there is no method to date that exploits this phenomenon to improve generation. We fill this gap. In this study, we show that the pointwise mutual information between a context and a question is an effective gauge for language model performance. Importantly, this gauge does not depend on knowing the answer to the question a priori. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets and a variety of large language models, we find evidence for an empirical correlation between answer accuracy and pointwise mutual information. Additionally, we propose two methods that use the pointwise mutual information between a document and a question as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance, whose effectiveness we demonstrate through experimentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Garg, Trilok Padhi, Hemang Jain, Ugur Kursuncu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwen Jiao, Yangyi Fang, Baoyun Peng, Wangqun Chen, Bharadwaj Veeravalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have made them crucial for visual question answering (VQA) in autonomous driving, enabling natural human-vehicle interactions. However, existing methods often struggle in dynamic driving environments, as they usually focus on static images or videos and rely on downsampling to manage computational costs. This results in the loss of critical details and the difficulty in effectively integrating spatial and temporal information, undermining fine-grained perception and temporal coherence essential for effective decision-making. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LaVida Drive, a novel and efficient VQA framework for autonomous driving. LaVida Drive seamlessly integrates temporal data while maintaining high-resolution inputs for detailed visual perception. It optimizes spatial processing by retaining high-resolution data for intricate details and using lower-resolution inputs for temporal analysis to focus on motion-related features, thereby boosting computational efficiency. The core of LaVida Drive consists of two modules: the \textit{Query-aware Token Selection} module and the \textit{Spatial-Temporal Token Recovery and Enhancement} module. The former dynamically selects the most relevant visual tokens based on semantic alignment with the input query, reducing the token count from high-resolution spatial input. The latter ensures smooth and coherent interactions between spatial and temporal information, preserving contextual continuity across frames. Extensive experiments on various autonomous driving question-answering benchmarks show that LaVida Drive significantly reduces visual tokens, enhances efficiency, and improves overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Hui, Zhaoxiao Guo, Hang Zhao, Juanyong Duan, Lin Ai, Yinheng Li, Julia Hirschberg, Congrui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective toxic content detection relies heavily on high-quality and diverse data, which serve as the foundation for robust content moderation models. Synthetic data has become a common approach for training models across various NLP tasks. However, its effectiveness remains uncertain for highly subjective tasks like hate speech detection, with previous research yielding mixed results. This study explores the potential of open-source LLMs for harmful data synthesis, utilizing controlled prompting and supervised fine-tuning techniques to enhance data quality and diversity. We systematically evaluated 6 open source LLMs on 5 datasets, assessing their ability to generate diverse, high-quality harmful data while minimizing hallucination and duplication. Our results show that Mistral consistently outperforms other open models, and supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances data reliability and diversity. We further analyze the trade-offs between prompt-based vs. fine-tuned toxic data synthesis, discuss real-world deployment challenges, and highlight ethical considerations. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned open source LLMs provide scalable and cost-effective solutions to augment toxic content detection datasets, paving the way for more accessible and transparent content moderation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Amiri-Margavi, Iman Jebellat, Ehsan Jebellat, Seyed Pouyan Mousavi Davoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a collaborative framework in which multiple large language models -- including GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash -- generate and answer complex, PhD-level statistical questions when definitive ground truth is unavailable. Our study examines how inter-model consensus improves both response reliability and identifies the quality of the generated questions. Employing chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa, and confidence interval analysis, we quantify consensus rates and inter-rater agreement to assess both response precision and question quality. Key results indicate that Claude and GPT-4 produce well-structured, less ambiguous questions with a higher inter-rater agreement, as shown by narrower confidence intervals and greater alignment with question-generating models. In contrast, Gemini and LLaMA exhibit greater variability and lower reliability in question formulation. These findings demonstrate that collaborative interactions among large language models enhance response reliability and provide valuable insights for optimizing AI-driven collaborative reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alain Riou, Antonin Gagner\'e, Ga\"etan Hadjeres, Stefan Lattner, Geoffroy Peeters</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of musical stem retrieval. Given a musical mix, it consists in retrieving a stem that would fit with it, i.e., that would sound pleasant if played together. To do so, we introduce a new method based on Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures, where an encoder and a predictor are jointly trained to produce latent representations of a context and predict latent representations of a target. In particular, we design our predictor to be conditioned on arbitrary instruments, enabling our model to perform zero-shot stem retrieval. In addition, we discover that pretraining the encoder using contrastive learning drastically improves the model's performance.
  We validate the retrieval performances of our model using the MUSDB18 and MoisesDB datasets. We show that it significantly outperforms previous baselines on both datasets, showcasing its ability to support more or less precise (and possibly unseen) conditioning. We also evaluate the learned embeddings on a beat tracking task, demonstrating that they retain temporal structure and local information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weishun Zhong, Tankut Can, Antonis Georgiou, Ilya Shnayderman, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubha Mahajan, Shreya Hegde, Ethan Shay, Daniel Wu, Aviva Prins</p>
<p>Abstract: In India, the majority of farmers are classified as small or marginal, making their livelihoods particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to market saturation and climate risks. Effective crop planning can significantly impact their expected income, yet existing decision support systems (DSS) often provide generic recommendations that fail to account for real-time market dynamics and the interactions among multiple farmers. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for optimizing total farmer income and promoting fairness in crop planning: Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each farmer acts independently without coordination, Agent-by-Agent (ABA), which sequentially optimizes each farmer's policy in relation to the others, and the Multi-agent Rollout Policy, which jointly optimizes all farmers' actions for global reward maximization. Our results demonstrate that while IQL offers computational efficiency with linear runtime, it struggles with coordination among agents, leading to lower total rewards and an unequal distribution of income. Conversely, the Multi-agent Rollout policy achieves the highest total rewards and promotes equitable income distribution among farmers but requires significantly more computational resources, making it less practical for large numbers of agents. ABA strikes a balance between runtime efficiency and reward optimization, offering reasonable total rewards with acceptable fairness and scalability. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate MARL approaches in DSS to provide personalized and equitable crop planning recommendations, advancing the development of more adaptive and farmer-centric agricultural decision-making systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungwon Park, Jungmin Ko, Dongnam Byun, Jangwon Suh, Wonjong Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models leverage cross-attention layers, which have been effectively utilized to enhance a range of visual generative tasks. However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach for diffusion models by constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with human-specified visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept has a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, with each element representing the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. To validate HRVs as interpretable features, we develop an ordered weakening analysis that demonstrates their effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. Our results show that HRVs can reduce misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation, successfully modify five challenging attributes in image editing, and mitigate catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation. Overall, our work provides an advancement in understanding cross-attention layers and introduces new approaches for fine-controlling these layers at the head level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghan Long, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion models cannot simultaneously generate an image and a panoptic segmentation of objects and stuff from the prompt. Incorporating an inherent understanding of shapes and scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone. We propose a Multi-Scale Patching mechanism to generate high-resolution segmentation maps. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07904">Score Change of Variables</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Robbins</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Bajpai, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON, a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages -- Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced large language models (LLMs), particularly exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have exhibited outstanding performance. Despite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its implementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward modeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses challenges for researchers and practitioners in developing a systematic understanding of RL-enhanced LLMs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive survey summarizing existing research on RL-enhanced LLMs has limited progress in this domain, hindering further advancements.
  In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Metaphor serves as an implicit approach to convey information, while enabling the generalized comprehension of complex subjects. However, metaphor can potentially be exploited to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the theft of harmful knowledge. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits the imaginative capacity of LLMs to achieve jailbreaking, the J\underline{\textbf{A}}ilbreak \underline{\textbf{V}}ia \underline{\textbf{A}}dversarial Me\underline{\textbf{TA}} -pho\underline{\textbf{R}} (\textit{AVATAR}). Specifically, to elicit the harmful response, AVATAR extracts harmful entities from a given harmful target and maps them to innocuous adversarial entities based on LLM's imagination. Then, according to these metaphors, the harmful target is nested within human-like interaction for jailbreaking adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferablly jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs. Our study exposes a security risk in LLMs from their endogenous imaginative capabilities. Furthermore, the analytical study reveals the vulnerability of LLM to adversarial metaphors and the necessity of developing defense methods against jailbreaking caused by the adversarial metaphor. \textcolor{orange}{ \textbf{Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful content from LLMs.}}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Ding, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Gong, Akshat Kumar, Pradeep Varakantham</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{REFA}$, a family of reference-free alignment methods that optimize over multiple user preferences while enforcing fine-grained length control. Our approach integrates deviation-based weighting to emphasize high-quality responses, length normalization to prevent trivial short-response solutions, and an EOS-probability regularizer to mitigate dataset-induced brevity biases. Theoretically, we show that under the Uncertainty Reduction with Sequence Length Assertion (URSLA) framework, naive length normalization can still incentivize length-based shortcuts. In contrast, REFA corrects these subtle incentives, guiding models toward genuinely more informative and higher-quality outputs. Empirically, REFA achieves a new $\textbf{state-of-the-art}$ among reference-free alignment methods, generating richer responses that align more closely with human preferences. Notably, REFA improves performance on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark, achieving a $\textbf{26.6%}$ Length-Controlled Win Rate (LC-WR) and $\textbf{24.2%}$ Win Rate (WR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Liu, Boran Wen, Xinpeng Liu, Zizheng Zhou, Hongwei Fan, Cewu Lu, Lizhuang Ma, Yulong Chen, Yong-Lu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal Human-Object Interaction (ST-HOI) understanding aims at detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding. However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines. Data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-AVA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Xiao, Edward Sun, Di Luo, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Supriya Manna, Niladri Sett</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning's preponderance across scientific domains has reshaped high-stakes decision-making, making it essential to follow rigorous operational frameworks that include both Right-to-Privacy (RTP) and Right-to-Explanation (RTE). This paper examines the complexities of combining these two requirements. For RTP, we focus on `Differential privacy' (DP), which is considered the current \textit{gold standard} for privacy-preserving machine learning due to its strong quantitative guarantee of privacy. For RTE, we focus on post-hoc explainers: they are the \textit{go-to} option for model auditing as they operate independently of model training. We formally investigate DP models and various commonly-used post-hoc explainers: how to evaluate these explainers subject to RTP, and analyze the intrinsic interactions between DP models and these explainers. Furthermore, our work throws light on how RTP and RTE can be effectively combined in high-stakes applications. Our study concludes by outlining an industrial software pipeline, with the example of a wildly used use-case, that respects both RTP and RTE requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipeng Kang, Junqi Wang, Yexin Li, Mengmeng Wang, Wenming Tu, Quansen Wang, Hengli Li, Tingjun Wu, Xue Feng, Fangwei Zhong, Zilong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiujie Song, Xiaoyi Pang, Haifeng Tang, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q. Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying image complexity at the entity level is straightforward, but the assessment of semantic complexity has been largely overlooked. In fact, there are differences in semantic complexity across images. Images with richer semantics can tell vivid and engaging stories and offer a wide range of application scenarios. For example, the Cookie Theft picture is such a kind of image and is widely used to assess human language and cognitive abilities due to its higher semantic complexity. Additionally, semantically rich images can benefit the development of vision models, as images with limited semantics are becoming less challenging for them. However, such images are scarce, highlighting the need for a greater number of them. For instance, there is a need for more images like Cookie Theft to cater to people from different cultural backgrounds and eras. Assessing semantic complexity requires human experts and empirical evidence. Automatic evaluation of how semantically rich an image will be the first step of mining or generating more images with rich semantics, and benefit human cognitive assessment, Artificial Intelligence, and various other applications. In response, we propose the Image Semantic Assessment (ISA) task to address this problem. We introduce the first ISA dataset and a novel method that leverages language to solve this vision problem. Experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stable Diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating photorealistic images from text prompts but often falter when tasked with accurately representing complex spatial arrangements, particularly involving intricate 3D relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce SmartSpatial, an innovative approach that not only enhances the spatial arrangement capabilities of Stable Diffusion but also fosters AI-assisted creative workflows through 3D-aware conditioning and attention-guided mechanisms. SmartSpatial incorporates depth information injection and cross-attention control to ensure precise object placement, delivering notable improvements in spatial accuracy metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jushang Qiu, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention for its ability to efficiently represent spatiotemporal information in a lightweight format. Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Li, Yupeng Su, Runming Yang, Congkai Xie, Zheng Wang, Zhongwei Xie, Ngai Wong, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved significant advancements in complex mathematical reasoning benchmarks, such as MATH. However, their substantial computational requirements present challenges for practical deployment. Model quantization has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce memory usage and computational costs by employing lower precision and bit-width representations. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of quantization on mathematical reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that aggressive quantization methods like AWQ and GPTQ introduce up to 32.39% accuracy degradation (average 11.31%) on Llama-3 models, particularly in numerical computation and reasoning planning. To address this, we introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework combining qualitative capability analysis and quantitative error assessment. We further develop targeted recovery strategies, showing that fine-tuning quantized models on only 545 task-specific examples for 3 minutes on 4 GPUs effectively restores reasoning capabilities to near full-precision levels. Additionally, our error assessment pipeline achieves 98.9% accuracy in diagnosing and localizing errors across 3,366 failure cases, providing actionable insights for mitigating quantization-induced degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruilin Luo, Zhuofan Zheng, Yifan Wang, Yiyao Yu, Xinzhe Ni, Zicheng Lin, Jin Zeng, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is widely used to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The introduction of process supervision for CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on improving test-time scaling, thereby unlocking the System 2-style thinking capabilities of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving both deliberate reasoning and fine-grained verification. In this work, we propose a novel framework that introduces System 2-style thinking to multimodal mathematical reasoning. We introduce a three-module CoT data synthesis process that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. This process generates MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset. Furthermore, we implement a dual-view trajectory labeling automation that targets both visual grounding fidelity and deductive chain validity, resulting in the DualMath-1.1M dataset. The URSA-8B model, trained on MMathCoT-1M, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similarly sized multimodal LLMs on six popular reasoning benchmarks. Training URSA-8B further on the DualMath-1.1M dataset yields URSA-RM-8B, a verifier that enhances URSA-8B's test-time performance and surpasses strong closed-source multimodal MLLMs like GPT-4o.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subset Deep Learning (DL), has profoundly impacted numerous domains, including autonomous driving. The integration of autonomous driving in military settings reduces human casualties and enables precise and safe execution of missions in hazardous environments while allowing for reliable logistics support without the risks associated with fatigue-related errors. However, relying on autonomous driving solely requires an advanced decision-making model that is adaptable and optimum in any situation. Considering the presence of numerous interconnected autonomous vehicles in mission-critical scenarios, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is vital for ensuring seamless coordination, real-time data exchange, and instantaneous response to dynamic driving environments. The advent of 6G strengthens the Internet of Automated Defense Vehicles (IoADV) concept within the realm of Internet of Military Defense Things (IoMDT) by enabling robust connectivity, crucial for real-time data exchange, advanced navigation, and enhanced safety features through IoADV interactions. On the other hand, a critical advancement in this space is using pre-trained Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making and communication optimization for autonomous driving. Hence, this work presents opportunities and challenges with a vision of realizing the full potential of these technologies in critical defense applications, especially through the advancement of IoADV and its role in enhancing autonomous military operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Zellinger, Matt Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramesh Bahadur Bist, Lilong Chai, Shawna Weimer, Hannah Atungulua, Chantel Pennicott, Xiao Yang, Sachin Subedi, Chaitanya Pallerla, Yang Tian, Dongyi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence in poultry farming has highlighted the challenge of efficiently labeling large, diverse datasets. Manual annotation is time-consuming and costly, making it impractical for modern systems that continuously generate data. This study addresses this challenge by exploring semi-supervised auto-labeling methods, integrating self and active learning approaches to develop an efficient, label-scarce framework for auto-labeling large poultry datasets (ALPD). For this study, video data were collected from broilers and laying hens housed. Various machine learning models, including zero-shot models and supervised models, were utilized for broilers and hens detection. The results showed that YOLOv8s-World and YOLOv9s performed better when compared performance metrics for broiler and hen detection under supervised learning, while among the semi-supervised model, YOLOv8s-ALPD achieved the highest precision (96.1%) and recall (99%) with an RMSE of 1.87. The hybrid YOLO-World model, incorporating the optimal YOLOv8s backbone with zero-shot models, demonstrated the highest overall performance. It achieved a precision of 99.2%, recall of 99.4%, and an F1 score of 98.7% for detection. In addition, the semi-supervised models with minimal human intervention (active learning) reduced annotation time by over 80% compared to full manual labeling. Moreover, integrating zero-shot models with the best models enhanced broiler and hen detection, achieving comparable results to supervised models while significantly increasing speed. In conclusion, integrating semi-supervised auto-labeling and zero-shot models significantly improves detection accuracy. It reduces manual annotation efforts, offering a promising solution to optimize AI-driven systems in poultry farming, advancing precision livestock management, and promoting more sustainable practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive agents capable of understanding and executing instructions in the physical world have long been a central goal in AI research. The Minecraft Collaborative Building Task (MCBT) provides one such setting to work towards this goal (Narayan-Chen, Jayannavar, and Hockenmaier 2019). It is a two-player game in which an Architect (A) instructs a Builder (B) to construct a target structure in a simulated Blocks World Environment. We focus on the challenging Builder Action Prediction (BAP) subtask of predicting correct action sequences in a given multimodal game context with limited training data (Jayannavar, Narayan-Chen, and Hockenmaier 2020). We take a closer look at evaluation and data for the BAP task, discovering key challenges and making significant improvements on both fronts to propose BAP v2, an upgraded version of the task. This will allow future work to make more efficient and meaningful progress on it. It comprises of: (1) an enhanced evaluation benchmark that includes a cleaner test set and fairer, more insightful metrics, and (2) additional synthetic training data generated from novel Minecraft dialogue and target structure simulators emulating the MCBT. We show that the synthetic data can be used to train more performant and robust neural models even with relatively simple training methods. Looking ahead, such data could also be crucial for training more sophisticated, data-hungry deep transformer models and training/fine-tuning increasingly large LLMs. Although modeling is not the primary focus of this work, we also illustrate the impact of our data and training methodologies on a simple LLM- and transformer-based model, thus validating the robustness of our approach, and setting the stage for more advanced architectures and LLMs going forward.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the prevalence, disparities, and symptom variations of Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC) for vulnerable populations is crucial to improving care and addressing intersecting inequities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into PCC research by leveraging NLP techniques to analyze disparities and variations in SDOH representation within PCC case reports. Following construction of a PCC Case Report Corpus, comprising over 7,000 case reports from the LitCOVID repository, a subset of 709 reports were annotated with 26 core SDOH-related entity types using pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models, human review, and data augmentation to improve quality, diversity and representation of entity types. An NLP pipeline integrating NER, natural language inference (NLI), trigram and frequency analyses was developed to extract and analyze these entities. Both encoder-only transformer models and RNN-based models were assessed for the NER objective.
  Fine-tuned encoder-only BERT models outperformed traditional RNN-based models in generalizability to distinct sentence structures and greater class sparsity. Exploratory analysis revealed variability in entity richness, with prevalent entities like condition, age, and access to care, and underrepresentation of sensitive categories like race and housing status. Trigram analysis highlighted frequent co-occurrences among entities, including age, gender, and condition. The NLI objective (entailment and contradiction analysis) showed attributes like "Experienced violence or abuse" and "Has medical insurance" had high entailment rates (82.4%-80.3%), while attributes such as "Is female-identifying," "Is married," and "Has a terminal condition" exhibited high contradiction rates (70.8%-98.5%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohitash Chandra, Guoxiang Ren,  Group-H</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an increasing concern about the prevalence of abusive and violent content in Hollywood movies. This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the longitudinal abuse and sentiment analysis of Hollywood Oscar and blockbuster movie dialogues from 1950 to 2024. By employing fine-tuned LLMs, we analyze subtitles for over a thousand movies categorised into four genres to examine the trends and shifts in emotional and abusive content over the past seven decades. Our findings reveal significant temporal changes in movie dialogues, which reflect broader social and cultural influences. Overall, the emotional tendencies in the films are diverse, and the detection of abusive content also exhibits significant fluctuations. The results show a gradual rise in abusive content in recent decades, reflecting social norms and regulatory policy changes. Genres such as thrillers still present a higher frequency of abusive content that emphasises the ongoing narrative role of violence and conflict. At the same time, underlying positive emotions such as humour and optimism remain prevalent in most of the movies. Furthermore, the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues has been significant over the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuetong Sun, Peilan Xu, Wenjian Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In scenarios where multiple decision-makers operate within a common decision space, each focusing on their own multi-objective optimization problem (e.g., bargaining games), the problem can be modeled as a multi-party multi-objective optimization problem (MPMOP). While numerous evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve MPMOPs, most results remain empirical. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the expected runtime of evolutionary algorithms on bi-party multi-objective optimization problems (BPMOPs). Our findings demonstrate that employing traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms to solve MPMOPs is both time-consuming and inefficient, as the resulting population contains many solutions that fail to achieve consensus among decision-makers. An alternative approach involves decision-makers individually solving their respective optimization problems and seeking consensus only in the final stage. While feasible for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems, this method may fail to guarantee approximate performance for one party in NP-hard problems. Finally, We propose coevolutionary multi-party multi-objective optimizers (CoEMPMO) for pseudo-Boolean optimization and shortest path problems within a multi-party multi-objective context, which maintains a common solution set among all parties through coevolution. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \( \text{CoEMPMO}_{\text{random}} \) outperforms previous algorithms in terms of the expected lower bound on runtime for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems. Additionally, \( \text{CoEMPMO}_{\text{cons}}^{\text{SP}} \) achieves better efficiency and precision in solving shortest path problems compared to existing algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the significant success of deep learning models in computer vision, they often exhibit systematic failures on specific data subsets, known as error slices. Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DebugAgent, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. DebugAgent first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, DebugAgent extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that DebugAgent not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liana Mikaelyan, Ayyoob Imani, Mathew Salvaris, Parth Pathak, Mohsen Fayyaz</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DeltaLLM, a new post-training compression technique to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs. We propose an alternative way of structuring LLMs with weight sharing between layers in subsequent Transformer blocks, along with additional low-rank difference matrices between them. For training, we adopt the progressing module replacement method and show that the lightweight training of the low-rank modules with approximately 30M-40M tokens is sufficient to achieve performance on par with LLMs of comparable sizes trained from scratch. We release the resultant models, DeltaLLAMA and DeltaPHI, with a 12% parameter reduction, retaining 90% of the performance of the base Llama and Phi models on common knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Our method also outperforms compression techniques JointDrop, LaCo, ShortGPT and SliceGPT with the same number of parameters removed. For example, DeltaPhi 2.9B with a 24% reduction achieves similar average zero-shot accuracies as recovery fine-tuned SlicedPhi 3.3B with a 12% reduction, despite being approximately 400M parameters smaller with no fine-tuning applied. This work provides new insights into LLM architecture design and compression methods when storage space is critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Liang, Simin Niu, Zhiyu Li, Sensen Zhang, Hanyu Wang, Feiyu Xiong, Jason Zhaoxin Fan, Bo Tang, Shichao Song, Mengwei Wang, Jiawei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The indexing-retrieval-generation paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been highly successful in solving knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, the incorporation of external and unverified knowledge increases the vulnerability of LLMs because attackers can perform attack tasks by manipulating knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the RAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service. Next, we construct RAG security evaluation dataset (i.e., SafeRAG dataset) primarily manually for each task. We then utilize the SafeRAG dataset to simulate various attack scenarios that RAG may encounter. Experiments conducted on 14 representative RAG components demonstrate that RAG exhibits significant vulnerability to all attack tasks and even the most apparent attack task can easily bypass existing retrievers, filters, or advanced LLMs, resulting in the degradation of RAG service quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Liu, Zixuan Xie, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. It is widely believed that $Q$-learning with linear function approximation (i.e., linear $Q$-learning) suffers from possible divergence until the recent work Meyn (2024) which establishes the ultimate almost sure boundedness of the iterates of linear $Q$-learning. Building on this success, this paper further establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rate of linear $Q$-learning iterates (to a bounded set). Similar to Meyn (2024), we do not make any modification to the original linear $Q$-learning algorithm, do not make any Bellman completeness assumption, and do not make any near-optimality assumption on the behavior policy. All we need is an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy with an adaptive temperature. The key to our analysis is the general result of stochastic approximations under Markovian noise with fast-changing transition functions. As a side product, we also use this general result to establish the $L^2$ convergence rate of tabular $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy, for which we rely on a novel pseudo-contraction property of the weighted Bellman optimality operator.</p>

<p>Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in recommendation systems, online searches, and advertising platforms, where accurately capturing users' real interests in content is essential for performance. However, existing methods heavily rely on ID embeddings, which fail to reflect users' true preferences for content such as images and titles. This limitation becomes particularly evident in cold-start and long-tail scenarios, where traditional approaches struggle to deliver effective results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-modal Content Interest Modeling paradigm (MIM), which consists of three key stages: Pre-training, Content-Interest-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (C-SFT), and Content-Interest-Aware UBM (CiUBM). The pre-training stage adapts foundational models to domain-specific data, enabling the extraction of high-quality multi-modal embeddings. The C-SFT stage bridges the semantic gap between content and user interests by leveraging user behavior signals to guide the alignment of embeddings with user preferences. Finally, the CiUBM stage integrates multi-modal embeddings and ID-based collaborative filtering signals into a unified framework. Comprehensive offline experiments and online A/B tests conducted on the Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of MIM method. The method has been successfully deployed online, achieving a significant increase of +14.14% in CTR and +4.12% in RPM, showcasing its industrial applicability and substantial impact on platform performance. To promote further research, we have publicly released the code and dataset at https://pan.quark.cn/s/8fc8ec3e74f3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Li, Qi Zeng, Simon K. Warfield, Davood Karimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides unique insights into fetal brain microstructure in utero. Longitudinal and cross-sectional fetal dMRI studies can reveal crucial neurodevelopmental changes but require precise spatial alignment across scans and subjects. This is challenging due to low data quality, rapid brain development, and limited anatomical landmarks. Existing registration methods, designed for high-quality adult data, struggle with these complexities. To address this, we introduce FetDTIAlign, a deep learning approach for fetal brain dMRI registration, enabling accurate affine and deformable alignment. FetDTIAlign features a dual-encoder architecture and iterative feature-based inference, reducing the impact of noise and low resolution. It optimizes network configurations and domain-specific features at each registration stage, enhancing both robustness and accuracy. We validated FetDTIAlign on data from 23 to 36 weeks gestation, covering 60 white matter tracts. It consistently outperformed two classical optimization-based methods and a deep learning pipeline, achieving superior anatomical correspondence. Further validation on external data from the Developing Human Connectome Project confirmed its generalizability across acquisition protocols. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning for fetal brain dMRI registration, providing a more accurate and reliable alternative to classical techniques. By enabling precise cross-subject and tract-specific analyses, FetDTIAlign supports new discoveries in early brain development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Pratap</p>
<p>Abstract: This study employs machine learning, historical analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) to examine recurring lethal stampedes at Indias mass religious gatherings, focusing on the 2025 Mahakumbh tragedy in Prayagraj (48+ deaths) and its 1954 predecessor (700+ casualties). Through computational modeling of crowd dynamics and administrative records, it investigates how systemic vulnerabilities contribute to these disasters. Temporal trend analysis identifies persistent choke points, with narrow riverbank access routes linked to 92% of past stampede sites and lethal crowd densities recurring during spiritually significant moments like Mauni Amavasya. NLP analysis of seven decades of inquiry reports reveals cyclical administrative failures, where VIP route prioritization diverted safety resources in both 1954 and 2025, exacerbating fatalities. Statistical modeling demonstrates how ritual urgency overrides risk perception, leading to panic propagation patterns that mirror historical incidents. Findings support the Institutional Amnesia Theory, highlighting how disaster responses remain reactionary rather than preventive. By correlating archival patterns with computational crowd behavior analysis, this study frames stampedes as a collision of infrastructure limitations, socio spiritual urgency, and governance inertia, challenging disaster discourse to address how spiritual economies normalize preventable mortality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-based large language models (LLMs), particularly in the GPT series and the o1 model, have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling both training-time and inference-time compute. However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Gr\"oger, Pascal Baumann, Ludovic Amruthalingam, Laurent Simon, Ruksana Giurda, Simone Lionetti</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively steering hearable devices requires understanding the acoustic environment around the user. In the computational analysis of sound scenes, foundation models have emerged as the state of the art to produce high-performance, robust, multi-purpose audio representations. We introduce and release Deep Evaluation of Audio Representations (DEAR), the first dataset and benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of foundation models in capturing essential acoustic properties for hearables. The dataset includes 1,158 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, created by spatially mixing proprietary monologues with commercial, high-quality recordings of everyday acoustic scenes. Our benchmark encompasses eight tasks that assess the general context, speech sources, and technical acoustic properties of the audio scenes. Through our evaluation of four general-purpose audio representation models, we demonstrate that the BEATs model significantly surpasses its counterparts. This superiority underscores the advantage of models trained on diverse audio collections, confirming their applicability to a wide array of auditory tasks, including encoding the environment properties necessary for hearable steering.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06786">Matryoshka Quantization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Nair, Puranjay Datta, Jeff Dean, Prateek Jain, Aditya Kusupati</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantizing model weights is critical for reducing the communication and inference costs of large models. However, quantizing models -- especially to low precisions like int4 or int2 -- requires a trade-off in model quality; int2, in particular, is known to severely degrade model quality. Consequently, practitioners are often forced to maintain multiple models with different quantization levels or serve a single model that best satisfies the quality-latency trade-off. On the other hand, integer data types, such as int8, inherently possess a nested (Matryoshka) structure where smaller bit-width integers, like int4 or int2, are nested within the most significant bits. Leveraging this insight, in this paper, we propose Matryoshka Quantization (\alg), a novel multi-scale quantization technique that alleviates the aforementioned challenge. This technique allows us to train and maintain a single quantized model but serve it with the precision demanded by the deployment. Furthermore, leveraging \alg's co-training and co-distillation regularization, int2 precision models extracted by \alg outperform standard int2 quantization by up to to 4\% and 7\% with OmniQuant and QAT as base algorithms respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that by using an extra bit to represent outliers, a model with an effective precision of 2.05-bit gives an additional 6\% improvement with OmniQuant as the base algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurush Hiranandani, Haolun Wu, Subhojyoti Mukherjee, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Many commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) are often closed-source, limiting developers to prompt tuning for aligning content generation with specific applications. While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to \emph{Plugin} model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) transforms healthcare by enabling predictive analytics, personalized treatments, and improved patient outcomes. However, traditional ML workflows often require specialized skills, infrastructure, and resources, limiting accessibility for many healthcare professionals. This paper explores how BigQuery ML Cloud service helps healthcare researchers and data analysts to build and deploy models using SQL, without need for advanced ML knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the Boosted Tree model achieved the highest performance among the three models making it highly effective for diabetes prediction. BigQuery ML directly integrates predictive analytics into their workflows to inform decision-making and support patient care. We reveal this capability through a case study on diabetes prediction using the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset. Our study underscores BigQuery ML's role in democratizing machine learning, enabling faster, scalable, and efficient predictive analytics that can directly enhance healthcare decision-making processes. This study aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning and practical healthcare analytics by providing detailed insights into BigQuery ML's capabilities. By demonstrating its utility in a real-world case study, we highlight its potential to simplify complex workflows and expand access to predictive tools for a broader audience of healthcare professionals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Wang, Ying Fang, Xiaofei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reverberant speech, denoting the speech signal degraded by the process of reverberation, contains crucial knowledge of both anechoic source speech and room impulse response (RIR). This work proposes a variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework with neural speech prior (VINP) for joint speech dereverberation and blind RIR identification. In VINP, a probabilistic signal model is constructed in the time-frequency (T-F) domain based on convolution transfer function (CTF) approximation. For the first time, we propose using an arbitrary discriminative dereverberation deep neural network (DNN) to predict the prior distribution of anechoic speech within a probabilistic model. By integrating both reverberant speech and the anechoic speech prior, VINP yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations of the anechoic speech spectrum and CTF filter, respectively. After simple transformations, the waveforms of anechoic speech and RIR are estimated. Moreover, VINP is effective for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which sets it apart from most deep learning (DL)-based single-channel dereverberation approaches. Experiments on single-channel speech dereverberation demonstrate that VINP reaches an advanced level in most metrics related to human perception and displays unquestionable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in ASR-related metrics. For blind RIR identification, experiments indicate that VINP attains the SOTA level in blind estimation of reverberation time at 60 dB (RT60) and direct-to-reverberation ratio (DRR). Codes and audio samples are available online.</p>

<p>Abstract: India is a diverse society with unique challenges in developing AI systems, including linguistic diversity, oral traditions, data accessibility, and scalability. Existing foundation models are primarily trained on English, limiting their effectiveness for India's population. Indic languages comprise only 1 percent of Common Crawl corpora despite India representing 18 percent of the global population, leading to linguistic biases. Thousands of regional languages, dialects, and code mixing create additional representation challenges due to sparse training data.
  We introduce Krutrim LLM, a 2 trillion token multilingual model designed for India's linguistic landscape. It incorporates the largest known Indic dataset, mitigating data scarcity and ensuring balanced performance across dialects. Krutrim outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models on Indic benchmarks while maintaining competitive English performance. Despite being significantly smaller in training flops, Krutrim LLM matches or exceeds models like LLAMA-2 on 10 out of 16 tasks, with an average score of 0.57 versus 0.55. This evidences Krutrim's flexible multilingual fluency across diverse linguistic contexts.
  Krutrim is integrated with real-time search to improve factual accuracy in conversational AI applications. This enhances accessibility for over 1 billion users worldwide. Through intentional design choices addressing data imbalances, Krutrim LLM signifies meaningful progress in building ethical, globally representative AI models.</p>

<p>Abstract: News recommender systems play a critical role in mitigating the information overload problem. In recent years, due to the successful applications of large language model technologies, researchers have utilized Discriminative Large Language Models (DLLMs) or Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) to improve the performance of news recommender systems. Although several recent surveys review significant challenges for deep learning-based news recommender systems, such as fairness, privacy-preserving, and responsibility, there is a lack of a systematic survey on Large Language Model (LLM)-based news recommender systems. In order to review different core methodologies and explore potential issues systematically, we categorize DLLM-based and GLLM-based news recommender systems under the umbrella of LLM-based news recommender systems. In this survey, we first overview the development of deep learning-based news recommender systems. Then, we review LLM-based news recommender systems based on three aspects: news-oriented modeling, user-oriented modeling, and prediction-oriented modeling. Next, we examine the challenges from various perspectives, including datasets, benchmarking tools, and methodologies. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze how large language model technologies affect the performance of different news recommender systems. Finally, we comprehensively explore the future directions for LLM-based news recommendations in the era of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayi Wang, Zirui Wang, Junli Ren, Qingwei Ben, Tao Huang, Weinan Zhang, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traversing risky terrains with sparse footholds poses a significant challenge for humanoid robots, requiring precise foot placements and stable locomotion. Existing approaches designed for quadrupedal robots often fail to generalize to humanoid robots due to differences in foot geometry and unstable morphology, while learning-based approaches for humanoid locomotion still face great challenges on complex terrains due to sparse foothold reward signals and inefficient learning processes. To address these challenges, we introduce BeamDojo, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for enabling agile humanoid locomotion on sparse footholds. BeamDojo begins by introducing a sampling-based foothold reward tailored for polygonal feet, along with a double critic to balancing the learning process between dense locomotion rewards and sparse foothold rewards. To encourage sufficient trail-and-error exploration, BeamDojo incorporates a two-stage RL approach: the first stage relaxes the terrain dynamics by training the humanoid on flat terrain while providing it with task terrain perceptive observations, and the second stage fine-tunes the policy on the actual task terrain. Moreover, we implement a onboard LiDAR-based elevation map to enable real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that BeamDojo achieves efficient learning in simulation and enables agile locomotion with precise foot placement on sparse footholds in the real world, maintaining a high success rate even under significant external disturbances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoxuan Xu, Menglu Cui, Chengxiang Huang, Hongfa Wang, Di Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained attention for its capacity to integrate information from different modalities. However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives: performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models.

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Machine Unlearning (MU) has introduced solutions for the selective removal of private or sensitive information encoded within deep neural networks. Nonetheless, MU for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains in its nascent phase. Therefore, we propose to reformulate the task of multimodal MU in the era of MLLMs, which aims to erase only the visual patterns associated with a given entity while preserving the corresponding textual knowledge encoded within the original parameters of the language model backbone. Furthermore, we develop a novel geometry-constrained gradient descent method MMUnlearner. It updates the weights of MLLMs with a weight saliency map jointly restricted by the remaining concepts and textual knowledge during unlearning, thereby preserving parameters essential for non-target knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMUnlearner surpasses baselines that finetuning MLLMs with VQA data directly through Gradient Ascent (GA) or Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), across all evaluation dimensions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manan Tayal, Aditya Singh, Shishir Kolathaya, Somil Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high performance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Huang, Jiaheng Liu, Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Bing Xu, Conghui Zhu, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex instruction-following with elaborate constraints is imperative for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing methods have constructed data for complex instruction alignment, they all rely on a more advanced model, especially GPT-4, limiting their application. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Self-Contrastive Training (MuSC) framework, to improve the complex instruction alignment without relying on a stronger model. Our method is conducted on both coarse and fine granularity. On coarse-granularity, we construct constraint-aware preference data based on instruction decomposition and recombination. On fine-granularity, we perform token-aware preference optimization with dynamic token-level supervision. Our method is evaluated on open-sourced models, and experiment results show our method achieves significant improvement on both complex and general instruction-following benchmarks, surpassing previous self-alignment methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chhavi Kirtani, Madhav Krishan Garg, Tejash Prasad, Tanmay Singhal, Murari Mandal, Dhruv Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating volume of academic research, coupled with a shortage of qualified reviewers, necessitates innovative approaches to peer review. While large language model (LLMs) offer potential for automating this process, their current limitations include superficial critiques, hallucinations, and a lack of actionable insights. This research addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI-generated reviews, that measures alignment with human evaluations, verifies factual accuracy, assesses analytical depth, and identifies actionable insights. We also propose a novel alignment mechanism that tailors LLM-generated reviews to the unique evaluation priorities of individual conferences and journals. To enhance the quality of these reviews, we introduce a self-refinement loop that iteratively optimizes the LLM's review prompts. Our framework establishes standardized metrics for evaluating AI-based review systems, thereby bolstering the reliability of AI-generated reviews in academic research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Foster, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sifan Zhou, Shuo Wang, Zhihang Yuan, Mingjia Shi, Yuzhang Shang, Dawei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning technologies have achieved remarkable results. However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengkang Hu, Tianxing Chen, Yude Zou, Yuheng Lei, Qiguang Chen, Ming Li, Yao Mu, Hongyuan Zhang, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate symbolic world models from textual descriptions. Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs as world models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Burak Gulhan, Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Murali Emani, Mahmut Kandemir, Venkatram Vishwanath</p>
<p>Abstract: In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, Key-Value (KV) caches (KV-caches) are essential for reducing time complexity. However, they result in a linear increase in GPU memory as the context length grows. While recent work explores KV-cache eviction and compression policies to reduce memory usage, they often consider uniform KV-caches across all attention heads, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce BaKlaVa, a method to allocate optimal memory for individual KV-caches across the model by estimating the importance of each KV-cache. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that not all KV-caches are equally critical for LLM performance. Using a one-time profiling approach, BaKlaVa assigns optimal memory budgets to each KV-cache. We evaluated our method on LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B models, achieving up to a 70\% compression ratio while keeping baseline performance and delivering up to an order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement at higher compression levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burc Gokden</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanke Xia, Ruoxin Peng, Haoqi Chu, Xinlei Zhu, Zhiyu Yang, Yaojun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rice is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally and has been developed into numerous varieties. The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics. Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques. The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation. The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task. Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shansong Wang, Mojtaba Safari, Qiang Li, Chih-Wei Chang, Richard LJ Qiu, Justin Roper, David S. Yu, Xiaofeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are pre-trained on extensive image datasets to learn general representations for diverse types of data. These models can subsequently be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, significantly boosting performance across a broad range of applications. However, existing vision foundation models that claim to be applicable to various clinical tasks are mostly pre-trained on 3D computed tomography (CT), which benefits from the availability of extensive 3D CT databases. Significant differences between CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging principles, signal characteristics, and data distribution may hinder their practical performance and versatility in MRI-specific applications. Here, we propose Triad, a vision foundation model for 3D MRI. Triad adopts a widely used autoencoder architecture to learn robust representations from 131,170 3D MRI volumes and uses organ-independent imaging descriptions to constrain the semantic distribution of the visual modality. The above pre-training dataset is called Triad-131K, which is currently the largest 3D MRI pre-training dataset. We evaluate Triad across three tasks, namely, organ/tumor segmentation, organ/cancer classification, and medical image registration, in two data modalities (within-domain and out-of-domain) settings using 25 downstream datasets. By initializing models with Triad's pre-trained weights, nnUNet-Triad improves segmentation performance by 2.51% compared to nnUNet-Scratch across 17 datasets. Swin-B-Triad achieves a 3.97% improvement over Swin-B-Scratch in classification tasks across five datasets. SwinUNETR-Triad improves by 4.00% compared to SwinUNETR-Scratch in registration tasks across two datasets. Our study demonstrates that pre-training can improve performance when the data modalities and organs of upstream and downstream tasks are consistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Yang, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Xibin Song, Ziang Cheng, Senbo Wang, Shenzhou Chen, Weizhe Liu, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality 3D shapes and textures from diverse input prompts, including single images, multi-view images, and text descriptions. The framework consists of 3D shape generation and texture generation. (1). The 3D shape generation pipeline employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode implicit 3D geometries into a latent space and a diffusion network to generate latents conditioned on input prompts, with modifications to enhance model capacity. An alternative Artist-Created Mesh (AM) generation approach is also explored, yielding promising results for simpler geometries. (2). Texture generation involves a multi-stage process starting with frontal images generation followed by multi-view images generation, RGB-to-PBR texture conversion, and high-resolution multi-view texture refinement. A consistency scheduler is plugged into every stage, to enforce pixel-wise consistency among multi-view textures during inference, ensuring seamless integration.
  The pipeline demonstrates effective handling of diverse input formats, leveraging advanced neural architectures and novel methodologies to produce high-quality 3D content. This report details the system architecture, experimental results, and potential future directions to improve and expand the framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joeran Beel, Min-Yen Kan, Moritz Baumgart</p>
<p>Abstract: A major step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). If machines could generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human intervention, it would transform science. Sakana recently introduced the 'AI Scientist', claiming to conduct research autonomously, i.e. they imply to have achieved what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). The AI Scientist gained much attention, but a thorough independent evaluation has yet to be conducted.
  Our evaluation of the AI Scientist reveals critical shortcomings. The system's literature reviews produced poor novelty assessments, often misclassifying established concepts (e.g., micro-batching for stochastic gradient descent) as novel. It also struggles with experiment execution: 42% of experiments failed due to coding errors, while others produced flawed or misleading results. Code modifications were minimal, averaging 8% more characters per iteration, suggesting limited adaptability. Generated manuscripts were poorly substantiated, with a median of five citations, most outdated (only five of 34 from 2020 or later). Structural errors were frequent, including missing figures, repeated sections, and placeholder text like 'Conclusions Here'. Some papers contained hallucinated numerical results.
  Despite these flaws, the AI Scientist represents a leap forward in research automation. It generates full research manuscripts with minimal human input, challenging expectations of AI-driven science. Many reviewers might struggle to distinguish its work from human researchers. While its quality resembles a rushed undergraduate paper, its speed and cost efficiency are unprecedented, producing a full paper for USD 6 to 15 with 3.5 hours of human involvement, far outpacing traditional researchers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Llamba, a family of efficient recurrent language models distilled from Llama-3.x into the Mamba architecture. The series includes Llamba-1B, Llamba-3B, and Llamba-8B, which achieve higher inference throughput and handle significantly larger batch sizes than Transformer-based models while maintaining comparable benchmark performance. Furthermore, Llamba demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-architecture distillation using MOHAWK (Bick et al., 2024), achieving these results with less than 0.1% of the training data typically used for models of similar size. To take full advantage of their efficiency, we provide an optimized implementation of Llamba for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones and edge platforms, offering a practical and memory-efficient alternative to Transformers. Overall, Llamba improves the tradeoff between speed, memory efficiency, and performance, making high-quality language models more accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Deng, Han Zhong, Rui Ai, Fuli Feng, Zheng Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To accurately estimate margins for data selection, we propose a dual-margin guided approach that considers both external reward margins and implicit DPO reward margins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reduces computational cost dramatically while improving performance. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama and Mistral series models on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, while further reducing training time. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuguo Yin, Yuxin Xie, Wenyuan Yang, Dongchao Yang, Jinghan Ru, Xianwei Zhuang, Liming Liang, Yuexian Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual audio-text retrieval (ML-ATR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve audio clips or multilingual texts from databases. However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. We theoretically analyze the inconsistency in terms of both multilingual modal alignment direction error and weight error, and propose the theoretical weight error upper bound for quantifying the inconsistency. Based on the analysis of the weight error upper bound, we find that the inconsistency problem stems from the data distribution error caused by random sampling of languages. We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and consistency in ML-ATR. Experimental results on the translated AudioCaps and Clotho datasets show that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on recall and consistency metrics for eight mainstream languages, including English.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Li, Stamos Katsigiannis, Tae-Kyun Kim, Hubert P. H. Shum</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction allows better decision-making in applications of autonomous vehicles or surveillance by predicting the short-term future movement of traffic agents. It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eliott Thomas, Mickael Coustaty, Aurelie Joseph, Gaspar Deloin, Elodie Carel, Vincent Poulain D'Andecy, Jean-Marc Ogier</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting tables from documents is a critical task across various industries, especially on business documents like invoices and reports. Existing systems based on DEtection TRansformer (DETR) such as TAble TRansformer (TATR), offer solutions for Table Detection (TD) and Table Structure Recognition (TSR) but face challenges with diverse table formats and common errors like incorrect area detection and overlapping columns. This research introduces RAPTOR, a modular post-processing system designed to enhance state-of-the-art models for improved table extraction, particularly for product tables. RAPTOR addresses recurrent TD and TSR issues, improving both precision and structural predictions. For TD, we use DETR (trained on ICDAR 2019) and TATR (trained on PubTables-1M and FinTabNet), while TSR only relies on TATR. A Genetic Algorithm is incorporated to optimize RAPTOR's module parameters, using a private dataset of product tables to align with industrial needs. We evaluate our method on two private datasets of product tables, the public DOCILE dataset (which contains tables similar to our target product tables), and the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2019 datasets. The results demonstrate that while our approach excels at product tables, it also maintains reasonable performance across diverse table formats. An ablation study further validates the contribution of each module in our system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuoya Xiong, Aarti Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aarash Feizi, Sai Rajeswar, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Reihaneh Rabbany, Spandana Gella, Valentina Zantedeschi, Jo\~ao Monteiro</p>
<p>Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, understanding their ability to effectively compare data pairs as instructed in the prompt becomes essential. To address this, we present PairBench, a low-cost framework that systematically evaluates VLMs as customizable similarity tools across various modalities and scenarios. Through PairBench, we introduce four metrics that represent key desiderata of similarity scores: alignment with human annotations, consistency for data pairs irrespective of their order, smoothness of similarity distributions, and controllability through prompting. Our analysis demonstrates that no model, whether closed- or open-source, is superior on all metrics; the optimal choice depends on an auto evaluator's desired behavior (e.g., a smooth vs. a sharp judge), highlighting risks of widespread adoption of VLMs as evaluators without thorough assessment. For instance, the majority of VLMs struggle with maintaining symmetric similarity scores regardless of order. Additionally, our results show that the performance of VLMs on the metrics in PairBench closely correlates with popular benchmarks, showcasing its predictive power in ranking models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaohua Tang, Zhicheng Hu, Kun Cheng, Fan Mo, Qiheng Lv, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasmus Aavang, Giovanni Rizzi, Rasmus B{\o}ggild, Alexandre Iolov, Mike Zhang, Johannes Bjerva</p>
<p>Abstract: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that public companies file financial reports tagging numbers with the machine readable inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL) standard. However, the highly complex and highly granular taxonomy defined by iXBRL limits label transferability across domains. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Financial Key Performance Indicator (HiFi-KPI) dataset, designed to facilitate numerical KPI extraction at specified levels of granularity from unstructured financial text. Our approach organizes a 218,126-label hierarchy using a taxonomy based grouping method, investigating which taxonomy layer provides the most meaningful structure. HiFi-KPI comprises ~1.8M paragraphs and ~5M entities, each linked to a label in the iXBRL-specific calculation and presentation taxonomies. We provide baselines using encoder-based approaches and structured extraction using Large Language Models (LLMs). To simplify LLM inference and evaluation, we additionally release HiFi-KPI Lite, a manually curated subset with four expert-mapped labels. We publicly release all artifacts.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15485">Enhancing RWKV-based Language Models for Long-Sequence Text Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced RWKV architecture with adaptive temporal gating mechanisms for improved long-context language modeling. We propose two principal innovations: (1) a position-aware convolutional shift operator that captures local syntactic patterns while preserving global coherence, and (2) a neurally-gated information routing mechanism that dynamically regulates inter-token information flow. Through comprehensive experiments on text generation tasks, our enhanced model demonstrates superior performance compared to the baseline RWKV, achieving 96.5 relative improvement in ROUGE-L scores with only 2.95 increased inference latency. Ablation studies validate the individual contributions of each component, while linguistic analysis reveals the model's adaptive attention to syntactic boundaries and entity coherence. The proposed modifications maintain RWKV's linear computational complexity while significantly enhancing its contextual modeling capabilities, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for recurrent-style architectures in long-form text generation.</p>
