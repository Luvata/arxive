<p><b>Authors:</b> Krunal Kishor Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article, we introduce the concept of discounted pseudocosts, inspired by discounted total reward in reinforcement learning, and explore their application in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Traditional pseudocosts estimate changes in the objective function due to variable bound changes during the branch-and-bound process. By integrating reinforcement learning concepts, we propose a novel approach incorporating a forward-looking perspective into pseudocost estimation. We present the motivation behind discounted pseudocosts and discuss how they represent the anticipated reward for branching after one level of exploration in the MILP problem space. Initial experiments on MIPLIB 2017 benchmark instances demonstrate the potential of discounted pseudocosts to enhance branching strategies and accelerate the solution process for challenging MILP problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianuo Huang, Zhenlong Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous driving, ensuring safety during motion planning and navigation is becoming more and more important. However, most end-to-end planning methods suffer from a lack of safety. This research addresses the safety issue in the control optimization problem of autonomous driving, formulated as Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We propose a novel, model-based approach for policy optimization, utilizing a conditional Value-at-Risk based Soft Actor Critic to manage constraints in complex, high-dimensional state spaces effectively. Our method introduces a worst-case actor to guide safe exploration, ensuring rigorous adherence to safety requirements even in unpredictable scenarios. The policy optimization employs the Augmented Lagrangian method and leverages latent diffusion models to predict and simulate future trajectories. This dual approach not only aids in navigating environments safely but also refines the policy's performance by integrating distribution modeling to account for environmental uncertainties. Empirical evaluations conducted in both simulated and real environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and decision-making capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Yu, Jihye Roh, Ziang Li, Wenhao Gao, Runzhong Wang, Connor W. Coley</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms have demonstrated expert-level abilities in planning retrosynthetic routes to molecules of low to moderate complexity. However, current search methods assume the sufficiency of reaching arbitrary building blocks, failing to address the common real-world constraint where using specific molecules is desired. To this end, we present a formulation of synthesis planning with starting material constraints. Under this formulation, we propose Double-Ended Synthesis Planning (DESP), a novel CASP algorithm under a bidirectional graph search scheme that interleaves expansions from the target and from the goal starting materials to ensure constraint satisfiability. The search algorithm is guided by a goal-conditioned cost network learned offline from a partially observed hypergraph of valid chemical reactions. We demonstrate the utility of DESP in improving solve rates and reducing the number of search expansions by biasing synthesis planning towards expert goals on multiple new benchmarks. DESP can make use of existing one-step retrosynthesis models, and we anticipate its performance to scale as these one-step model capabilities improve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantine Nakos, Kenneth D. Forbus</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand-curated natural language systems provide an inspectable, correctable alternative to language systems based on machine learning, but maintaining them requires considerable effort and expertise. Interactive Natural Language Debugging (INLD) aims to lessen this burden by casting debugging as a reasoning problem, asking the user a series of questions to diagnose and correct errors in the system's knowledge. In this paper, we present work in progress on an interactive error diagnosis system for the CNLU semantic parser. We show how the first two stages of the INLD pipeline (symptom identification and error localization) can be cast as a model-based diagnosis problem, demonstrate our system's ability to diagnose semantic errors on synthetic examples, and discuss design challenges and frontiers for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantine Nakos, Kenneth D. Forbus</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the fundamental aspects of cognitive architectures is their ability to encode and manipulate knowledge. Without a consistent, well-designed, and scalable knowledge management scheme, an architecture will be unable to move past toy problems and tackle the broader problems of cognition. In this paper, we document some of the challenges we have faced in developing the knowledge stack for the Companion cognitive architecture and discuss the tools, representations, and practices we have developed to overcome them. We also lay out a series of potential next steps that will allow Companion agents to play a greater role in managing their own knowledge. It is our hope that these observations will prove useful to other cognitive architecture developers facing similar challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the wealth of single-cell multi-omics data, it remains challenging to predict the consequences of novel genetic and chemical perturbations in the human body. It requires knowledge of molecular interactions at all biological levels, encompassing disease models and humans. Current machine learning methods primarily establish statistical correlations between genotypes and phenotypes but struggle to identify physiologically significant causal factors, limiting their predictive power. Key challenges in predictive modeling include scarcity of labeled data, generalization across different domains, and disentangling causation from correlation. In light of recent advances in multi-omics data integration, we propose a new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered biology-inspired multi-scale modeling framework to tackle these issues. This framework will integrate multi-omics data across biological levels, organism hierarchies, and species to predict causal genotype-environment-phenotype relationships under various conditions. AI models inspired by biology may identify novel molecular targets, biomarkers, pharmaceutical agents, and personalized medicines for presently unmet medical needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Zhu, Peixian Zhang, Ehsan-Ul Haq, Pan Hui, Gareth Tyson</p>
<p>Abstract: Harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can help address social challenges through inclusive, ethical, and sustainable means. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ChatGPT can annotate data for social computing tasks, aiming to reduce the complexity and cost of undertaking web research. To evaluate ChatGPT's potential, we re-annotate seven datasets using ChatGPT, covering topics related to pressing social issues like COVID-19 misinformation, social bot deception, cyberbully, clickbait news, and the Russo-Ukrainian War. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT exhibits promise in handling these data annotation tasks, albeit with some challenges. Across the seven datasets, ChatGPT achieves an average annotation F1-score of 72.00%. Its performance excels in clickbait news annotation, correctly labeling 89.66% of the data. However, we also observe significant variations in performance across individual labels. Our study reveals predictable patterns in ChatGPT's annotation performance. Thus, we propose GPT-Rater, a tool to predict if ChatGPT can correctly label data for a given annotation task. Researchers can use this to identify where ChatGPT might be suitable for their annotation requirements. We show that GPT-Rater effectively predicts ChatGPT's performance. It performs best on a clickbait headlines dataset by achieving an average F1-score of 95.00%. We believe that this research opens new avenues for analysis and can reduce barriers to engaging in social computing research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from data that can assist organizations in making effective decisions. We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 31 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3-Eval as an effective, open-source evaluator method to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive data analytics and can be accessed here: https://github.com/ServiceNow/insight-bench.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06443">Exposing Privacy Gaps: Membership Inference Attack on Preference Data for LLM Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhang Feng, Siva Rajesh Kasa, Hyokun Yun, Choon Hui Teo, Sravan Babu Bodapati</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable natural language capabilities. However, when deploying them in real-world settings, it is important to align LLMs to generate texts according to acceptable human standards. Methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have made significant progress in refining LLMs using human preference data. However, the privacy concerns inherent in utilizing such preference data have yet to be adequately studied. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of LLMs aligned using human preference datasets to membership inference attacks (MIAs), highlighting the shortcomings of previous MIA approaches with respect to preference data. Our study has two main contributions: first, we introduce a novel reference-based attack framework specifically for analyzing preference data called PREMIA (\uline{Pre}ference data \uline{MIA}); second, we provide empirical evidence that DPO models are more vulnerable to MIA compared to PPO models. Our findings highlight gaps in current privacy-preserving practices for LLM alignment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06486">Optimal Decision Making Through Scenario Simulations Using Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumedh Rasal, EJ Hauer</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has markedly expanded their application across diverse domains, transforming how complex problems are approached and solved. Initially conceived to predict subsequent words in texts, these models have transcended their original design to comprehend and respond to the underlying contexts of queries. Today, LLMs routinely perform tasks that once seemed formidable, such as writing essays, poems, stories, and even developing software code. As their capabilities continue to grow, so too do the expectations of their performance in even more sophisticated domains.
  Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options. These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.
  This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap. By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process. This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria. By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie Subbiah, Faisal Ladhak, Akankshya Mishra, Griffin Adams, Lydia B. Chilton, Kathleen McKeown</p>
<p>Abstract: Human evaluation has been the gold standard for checking faithfulness in abstractive summarization. However, with a challenging source domain like narrative, multiple annotators can agree a summary is faithful, while missing details that are obvious errors only once pointed out. We therefore introduce a new dataset, STORYSUMM, comprising LLM summaries of short stories with localized faithfulness labels and error explanations. This benchmark is for evaluation methods, testing whether a given method can detect challenging inconsistencies. Using this dataset, we first show that any one human annotation protocol is likely to miss inconsistencies, and we advocate for pursuing a range of methods when establishing ground truth for a summarization dataset. We finally test recent automatic metrics and find that none of them achieve more than 70% balanced accuracy on this task, demonstrating that it is a challenging benchmark for future work in faithfulness evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooyan Rahmanzadehgervi, Logan Bolton, Mohammad Reza Taesiri, Anh Totti Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models with vision capabilities (VLMs), e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro are powering countless image-text applications and scoring high on many vision-understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that VLMs fail on 7 visual tasks absurdly easy to humans such as identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) counting the number of circles in a Olympic-like logo. The shockingly poor performance of four state-of-the-art VLMs suggests their vision is, at best, like of a person with myopia seeing fine details as blurry, and at worst, like an intelligent person that is blind making educated guesses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renjie Liang, Li Li, Chongzhi Zhang, Jing Wang, Xizhou Zhu, Aixin Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the task of \textit{Ranked Video Moment Retrieval} (RVMR) to locate a ranked list of matching moments from a collection of videos, through queries in natural language. Although a few related tasks have been proposed and studied by CV, NLP, and IR communities, RVMR is the task that best reflects the practical setting of moment search. To facilitate research in RVMR, we develop the TVR-Ranking dataset, based on the raw videos and existing moment annotations provided in the TVR dataset. Our key contribution is the manual annotation of relevance levels for 94,442 query-moment pairs. We then develop the $NDCG@K, IoU\geq \mu$ evaluation metric for this new task and conduct experiments to evaluate three baseline models. Our experiments show that the new RVMR task brings new challenges to existing models and we believe this new dataset contributes to the research on multi-modality search.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas B Fr{\o}sig (UniCA, LINE), Margarida Romero (UniCA, LINE)</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (genAI) is being used in education for different purposes. From the teachers' perspective, genAI can support activities such as learning design. However, there is a need to study the impact of genAI on the teachers' agency. While GenAI can support certain processes of idea generation and co-creation, GenAI has the potential to negatively affect professional agency due to teachers' limited power to (i) act, (ii) affect matters, and (iii) make decisions or choices, as well as the possibility to (iv) take a stance. Agency is identified in the learning sciences studies as being one of the factors in teachers' ability to trust AI. This paper aims to introduce a dual perspective. First, educational technology, as opposed to other computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools, has two distinctly different user groups and different user needs, in the form of learners and teachers, to cater for. Second, the design of educational technology often prioritises learner agency and engagement, thereby limiting the opportunities for teachers to influence the technology and take action. This study aims to analyse the way GenAI is influencing teachers' agency. After identifying the current limits of GenAI, a solution based on the combination of human intelligence and artificial intelligence through a hybrid intelligence approach is proposed. This combination opens up the discussion of a collaboration between teacher and genAI being able to open up new practices in learning design in which they HI support the extension of the teachers' activity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abrar Jahin, M. F. Mridha, Zeyar Aung, Nilanjan Dey, R. Simon Sherratt</p>
<p>Abstract: Geomagnetic storms, caused by solar wind energy transfer to Earth's magnetic field, can disrupt critical infrastructure like GPS, satellite communications, and power grids. The disturbance storm-time (Dst) index measures storm intensity. Despite advancements in empirical, physics-based, and machine-learning models using real-time solar wind data, accurately forecasting extreme geomagnetic events remains challenging due to noise and sensor failures. This research introduces TriQXNet, a novel hybrid classical-quantum neural network for Dst forecasting. Our model integrates classical and quantum computing, conformal prediction, and explainable AI (XAI) within a hybrid architecture. To ensure high-quality input data, we developed a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that included feature selection, normalization, aggregation, and imputation. TriQXNet processes preprocessed solar wind data from NASA's ACE and NOAA's DSCOVR satellites, predicting the Dst index for the current hour and the next, providing vital advance notice to mitigate geomagnetic storm impacts. TriQXNet outperforms 13 state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning models, achieving a root mean squared error of 9.27 nanoteslas (nT). Rigorous evaluation through 10-fold cross-validated paired t-tests confirmed its superior performance with 95% confidence. Conformal prediction techniques provide quantifiable uncertainty, which is essential for operational decisions, while XAI methods like ShapTime enhance interpretability. Comparative analysis shows TriQXNet's superior forecasting accuracy, setting a new level of expectations for geomagnetic storm prediction and highlighting the potential of classical-quantum hybrid models in space weather forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has accelerated innovations in different aspects of citizens' lives. Many contexts have already addressed technology-enhanced learning, but educators at different educational levels now need to develop AI literacy and the ability to integrate appropriate AI usage into their teaching. We take into account this objective, along with the creative learning design, to create a formative intervention that enables preservice teachers, in-service teachers, and EdTech specialists to effectively incorporate AI into their teaching practices. We developed the formative intervention with Terra Numerica and Maison de l'Intelligence Artificielle in two phases in order to enhance their understanding of AI and foster its creative application in learning design. Participants reflect on AI's potential in teaching and learning by exploring different activities that can integrate AI literacy in education, including its ethical considerations and potential for innovative pedagogy. The approach emphasises not only acculturating professionals to AI but also empowering them to collaboratively design AI-enhanced educational activities that promote learner engagement and personalised learning experiences. Through this process, participants in the workshops develop the skills and mindset necessary to effectively leverage AI while maintaining a critical awareness of its implications in education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maurizio d'Andrea (TSE-R), Fabien Gensbittel (TSE-R), J\'er\^ome Renault (TSE-R)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the last-iterate convergence properties of the exponential weights algorithm with constant learning rates.  We consider a repeated interaction in discrete time, where each player uses an exponential weights algorithm characterized by an initial mixed action and a fixed learning rate, so that the mixed action profile $p^t$ played at stage $t$ follows an homogeneous Markov chain. At first, we show that whenever a strict Nash equilibrium exists, the probability to play a strict Nash equilibrium at the next stage  converges almost surely to 0 or 1. Secondly, we show that the limit of $p^t$, whenever it exists, belongs to the set of ``Nash Equilibria with Equalizing Payoffs''. Thirdly, we show that in strong coordination games, where the payoff of a player is positive on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere, $p^t$ converges almost surely  to one of the strict Nash equilibria. We conclude with   open questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atilla \"Ozg\"ur, Y{\i}lmaz Uygun</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a simple architecture for Enterprise application for Large Language Models (LLMs) for role based security and NATO clearance levels. Our proposal aims to address the limitations of current LLMs in handling security and information access. The proposed architecture could be used while utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine tuning of Mixture of experts models (MoE). It could be used only with RAG, or only with MoE or with both of them. Using roles and security clearance level of the user, documents in RAG and experts in MoE are filtered. This way information leakage is prevented.</p>

<p>Abstract: The vision of IASIS project is to turn the wave of big biomedical data heading our way into actionable knowledge for decision makers. This is achieved by integrating data from disparate sources, including genomics, electronic health records and bibliography, and applying advanced analytics methods to discover useful patterns. The goal is to turn large amounts of available data into actionable information to authorities for planning public health activities and policies. The integration and analysis of these heterogeneous sources of information will enable the best decisions to be made, allowing for diagnosis and treatment to be personalised to each individual. The project offers a common representation schema for the heterogeneous data sources. The iASiS infrastructure is able to convert clinical notes into usable data, combine them with genomic data, related bibliography, image data and more, and create a global knowledge base. This facilitates the use of intelligent methods in order to discover useful patterns across different resources. Using semantic integration of data gives the opportunity to generate information that is rich, auditable and reliable. This information can be used to provide better care, reduce errors and create more confidence in sharing data, thus providing more insights and opportunities. Data resources for two different disease categories are explored within the iASiS use cases, dementia and lung cancer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Bortoletto, Constantin Ruhdorfer, Lei Shi, Andreas Bulling</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose MToMnet - a Theory of Mind (ToM) neural network for predicting beliefs and their dynamics during human social interactions from multimodal input. ToM is key for effective nonverbal human communication and collaboration, yet, existing methods for belief modelling have not included explicit ToM modelling or have typically been limited to one or two modalities. MToMnet encodes contextual cues (scene videos and object locations) and integrates them with person-specific cues (human gaze and body language) in a separate MindNet for each person. Inspired by prior research on social cognition and computational ToM, we propose three different MToMnet variants: two involving fusion of latent representations and one involving re-ranking of classification scores. We evaluate our approach on two challenging real-world datasets, one focusing on belief prediction, while the other examining belief dynamics prediction. Our results demonstrate that MToMnet surpasses existing methods by a large margin while at the same time requiring a significantly smaller number of parameters. Taken together, our method opens up a highly promising direction for future work on artificial intelligent systems that can robustly predict human beliefs from their non-verbal behaviour and, as such, more effectively collaborate with humans.</p>

<p>Abstract: A new cluster validity index is proposed for fuzzy clusters obtained from fuzzy c-means algorithm. The proposed validity index exploits inter-cluster proximity between fuzzy clusters. Inter-cluster proximity is used to measure the degree of overlap between clusters. A low proximity value refers to well-partitioned clusters. The best fuzzy c-partition is obtained by minimizing inter-cluster proximity with respect to c. Well-known data sets are tested to show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed index.</p>

In order to tackle this problem, we have tried to model the inherent uncertainty and vagueness of color data using fuzzy color model. By taking fuzzy approach to color modeling, we could make a soft decision for the vague regions between neighboring colors. The proposed fuzzy color model defined a three dimensional fuzzy color ball and color membership computation method with two inter-color distances. With the fuzzy color model, we developed a new fuzzy clustering algorithm for an efficient partition of color data. Each fuzzy cluster set has a cluster prototype which is represented by fuzzy color centroid.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Zhang, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Gan Zheng, Basil AsSadhan, Fabio Roli</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have been shown to be powerful in many communication network design problems, including that in automatic modulation classification. However, they are vulnerable to carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Hence, the reliance of wireless networks on deep learning algorithms poses a serious threat to the security and operation of wireless networks. In this letter, we propose for the first time a countermeasure against adversarial examples in modulation classification. Our countermeasure is based on a neural rejection technique, augmented by label smoothing and Gaussian noise injection, that allows to detect and reject adversarial examples with high accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the proposed countermeasure can protect deep-learning based modulation classification systems against adversarial examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Zhang, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Gan Zheng, Guisheng Liao, Ambra Demontis, Fabio Roli</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the superior performance of deep learning in many applications including computer vision and natural language processing, several recent studies have focused on applying deep neural network for devising future generations of wireless networks. However, several recent works have pointed out that imperceptible and carefully designed adversarial examples (attacks) can significantly deteriorate the classification accuracy. In this paper, we investigate a defense mechanism based on both training-time and run-time defense techniques for protecting machine learning-based radio signal (modulation) classification against adversarial attacks. The training-time defense consists of adversarial training and label smoothing, while the run-time defense employs a support vector machine-based neural rejection (NR). Considering a white-box scenario and real datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed techniques outperform existing state-of-the-art technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Guan, Xiangyu Kong, Fangwei Zhong, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society. The complex interactions among multiple parties/ agents involve various abilities like social reasoning, negotiation arts, and long-term strategy planning. Previous AI agents surely have proved their capability of handling multi-step games and larger action spaces on tasks involving multiple agents. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. Recently, LLM agents have shown their potential for extending the boundary of previous agents on a couple of applications, however, it is still not enough to handle a very long planning period in a complex multi-agent environment. Empowered with cutting-edge LLM technology, we make the first stab to explore AI's upper bound towards a human-like agent for such a highly comprehensive multi-agent mission by combining three core and essential capabilities for stronger LLM-based societal agents: 1) strategic planner with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiate with social reasoning; 3) augmenting memory by self-play games to self-evolving without any human in the loop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulia Arg\"uello, Luca A. Lanzend\"orfer, Roger Wattenhofer</p>
<p>Abstract: Cue points indicate possible temporal boundaries in a transition between two pieces of music in DJ mixing and constitute a crucial element in autonomous DJ systems as well as for live mixing. In this work, we present a novel method for automatic cue point estimation, interpreted as a computer vision object detection task. Our proposed system is based on a pre-trained object detection transformer which we fine-tune on our novel cue point dataset. Our provided dataset contains 21k manually annotated cue points from human experts as well as metronome information for nearly 5k individual tracks, making this dataset 35x larger than the previously available cue point dataset. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require low-level musical information analysis, while demonstrating increased precision in retrieving cue point positions. Moreover, our proposed method demonstrates high adherence to phrasing, a type of high-level music structure commonly emphasized in electronic dance music. The code, model checkpoints, and dataset are made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Businesses need to query visually rich documents (VRDs) like receipts, medical records, and insurance forms to make decisions. Existing techniques for extracting entities from VRDs struggle with new layouts or require extensive pre-training data. We introduce VRDSynth, a program synthesis method to automatically extract entity relations from multilingual VRDs without pre-training data. To capture the complexity of VRD domain, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to capture spatial and textual relations to describe the synthesized programs. Along with this, we also derive a new synthesis algorithm utilizing frequent spatial relations, search space pruning, and a combination of positive, negative, and exclusive programs to improve coverage.
  We evaluate VRDSynth on the FUNSD and XFUND benchmarks for semantic entity linking, consisting of 1,592 forms in 8 languages. VRDSynth outperforms state-of-the-art pre-trained models (LayoutXLM, InfoXLMBase, and XLMRobertaBase) in 5, 6, and 7 out of 8 languages, respectively, improving the F1 score by 42% over LayoutXLM in English. To test the extensibility of the model, we further improve VRDSynth with automated table recognition, creating VRDSynth(Table), and compare it with extended versions of the pre-trained models, InfoXLM(Large) and XLMRoberta(Large). VRDSynth(Table) outperforms these baselines in 4 out of 8 languages and in average F1 score. VRDSynth also significantly reduces memory footprint (1M and 380MB vs. 1.48GB and 3GB for LayoutXLM) while maintaining similar time efficiency.</p>

Thank to this smart contract, the phases of parameter updates are managed efficiently, thereby strengthening data security. We have carried out an experimental study that exploits two different methods of weight aggregation, i.e., a classic averaging scheme and a federated proximal aggregation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Li, Zuchao Li, Ping Wang, Haojun Ai, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic entity recognition is an important task in the field of visually-rich document understanding. It distinguishes the semantic types of text by analyzing the position relationship between text nodes and the relation between text content. The existing document understanding models mainly focus on entity categories while ignoring the extraction of entity boundaries. We build a novel hypergraph attention document semantic entity recognition framework, HGA, which uses hypergraph attention to focus on entity boundaries and entity categories at the same time. It can conduct a more detailed analysis of the document text representation analyzed by the upstream model and achieves a better performance of semantic information. We apply this method on the basis of GraphLayoutLM to construct a new semantic entity recognition model HGALayoutLM. Our experiment results on FUNSD, CORD, XFUND and SROIE show that our method can effectively improve the performance of semantic entity recognition tasks based on the original model. The results of HGALayoutLM on FUNSD and XFUND reach the new state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milapji Singh Gill, Tom Westermann, Gernot Steindl, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay</p>
<p>Abstract: In the following contribution, a method is introduced that integrates domain expert-centric ontology design with the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). This approach aims to efficiently build an application-specific ontology tailored to the corrective maintenance of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The proposed method is divided into three phases. In phase one, ontology requirements are systematically specified, defining the relevant knowledge scope. Accordingly, CPS life cycle data is contextualized in phase two using domain-specific ontological artifacts. This formalized domain knowledge is then utilized in the CRISP-DM to efficiently extract new insights from the data. Finally, the newly developed data-driven model is employed to populate and expand the ontology. Thus, information extracted from this model is semantically annotated and aligned with the existing ontology in phase three. The applicability of this method has been evaluated in an anomaly detection case study for a modular process plant.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the transfer learning capabilities of the TrOCR architecture to Spanish. TrOCR is a transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model renowned for its state-of-the-art performance in English benchmarks. Inspired by Li et al. assertion regarding its adaptability to multilingual text recognition, we investigate two distinct approaches to adapt the model to a new language: integrating an English TrOCR encoder with a language specific decoder and train the model on this specific language, and fine-tuning the English base TrOCR model on a new language data. Due to the scarcity of publicly available datasets, we present a resource-efficient pipeline for creating OCR datasets in any language, along with a comprehensive benchmark of the different image generation methods employed with a focus on Visual Rich Documents (VRDs). Additionally, we offer a comparative analysis of the two approaches for the Spanish language, demonstrating that fine-tuning the English TrOCR on Spanish yields superior recognition than the language specific decoder for a fixed dataset size. We evaluate our model employing character and word error rate metrics on a public available printed dataset, comparing the performance against other open-source and cloud OCR spanish models. As far as we know, these resources represent the best open-source model for OCR in Spanish. The Spanish TrOCR models are publicly available on HuggingFace [20] and the code to generate the dataset is available on Github [25].</p>

<p>Abstract: In domain-specific applications, GPT-4, augmented with precise prompts or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shows notable potential but faces the critical tri-lemma of performance, cost, and data privacy. High performance requires sophisticated processing techniques, yet managing multiple agents within a complex workflow often proves costly and challenging. To address this, we introduce the PEER (Plan, Execute, Express, Review) multi-agent framework. This systematizes domain-specific tasks by integrating precise question decomposition, advanced information retrieval, comprehensive summarization, and rigorous self-assessment. Given the concerns of cost and data privacy, enterprises are shifting from proprietary models like GPT-4 to custom models, striking a balance between cost, security, and performance. We developed industrial practices leveraging online data and user feedback for efficient model tuning. This study provides best practice guidelines for applying multi-agent systems in domain-specific problem-solving and implementing effective agent tuning strategies. Our empirical studies, particularly in the financial question-answering domain, demonstrate that our approach achieves 95.0% of GPT-4's performance, while effectively managing costs and ensuring data privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Karim Gizzini, Yahia Medjahdi, Ali J. Ghandour, Laurent Clavier</p>
<p>Abstract: The support of artificial intelligence (AI) based decision-making is a key element in future 6G networks, where the concept of native AI will be introduced. Moreover, AI is widely employed in different critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In such applications, using AI as black-box models is risky and challenging. Hence, it is crucial to understand and trust the decisions taken by these models. Tackling this issue can be achieved by developing explainable AI (XAI) schemes that aim to explain the logic behind the black-box model behavior, and thus, ensure its efficient and safe deployment. Recently, we proposed a novel perturbation-based XAI-CHEST framework that is oriented toward channel estimation in wireless communications. The core idea of the XAI-CHEST framework is to identify the relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. This manuscript provides the detailed theoretical foundations of the XAI-CHEST framework. In particular, we derive the analytical expressions of the XAI-CHEST loss functions and the noise threshold fine-tuning optimization problem. Hence the designed XAI-CHEST delivers a smart input feature selection methodology that can further improve the overall performance while optimizing the architecture of the employed model. Simulation results show that the XAI-CHEST framework provides valid interpretations, where it offers an improved bit error rate performance while reducing the required computational complexity in comparison to the classical DL-based channel estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately and safely predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is essential for fully realizing autonomous driving (AD). This paper presents the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction model (HLTP++), which emulates human cognitive processes to improve trajectory prediction in AD. HLTP++ incorporates a novel teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The "teacher" model equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. On the other hand, the "student" model focuses on real-time interaction and human decision-making, drawing parallels to the human memory storage mechanism. Furthermore, we improve the model's efficiency by introducing a new Fourier Adaptive Spike Neural Network (FA-SNN), allowing for faster and more precise predictions with fewer parameters. Evaluated using the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD benchmarks, HLTP++ demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, which reduces the predicted trajectory error with over 11% on the NGSIM dataset and 25% on the HighD datasets. Moreover, HLTP++ demonstrates strong adaptability in challenging environments with incomplete input data. This marks a significant stride in the journey towards fully AD systems.</p>

Specifically, we consider a basic probabilistic model, a Naive Bayes classifier, based on multivariate Bernoullis and its extension to a two-tier network in which this classification model is connected to a lower layer consisting of a mixture of Bernoullis. We show how such models can be converted into (probabilistic) axioms (or rules) thus ensuring more interpretability. Moreover they may be also initialized exploiting expert knowledge. We present and discuss the outcomes of an empirical evaluation which aimed at testing the effectiveness of the models on a number of random classification problems with different ontologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangmin Li, Ruiqi Zhu, Wengen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is an active research area that combines multiple data modalities, e.g., text, image and audio, to analyze human emotions and benefits a variety of applications. Existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods can be classified as modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods and modality similarity-based methods. However, most of these methods highly rely on the strong correlations between modalities, and cannot fully uncover and utilize the correlations between modalities to enhance sentiment analysis. Therefore, these methods usually achieve bad performance for identifying the sentiment of multimodal data with weak correlations. To address this issue, we proposed a two-stage semi-supervised model termed Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer (CorMulT) which consists pre-training stage and prediction stage. At the pre-training stage, a modality correlation contrastive learning module is designed to efficiently learn modality correlation coefficients between different modalities. At the prediction stage, the learned correlation coefficients are fused with modality representations to make the sentiment prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Logan Cross, Violet Xiang, Agam Bhatia, Daniel LK Yamins, Nick Haber</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods struggle with the non-stationarity of multi-agent systems and fail to adaptively learn online when tested with novel agents. Here, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to create an autonomous agent that can handle these challenges. Our agent, Hypothetical Minds, consists of a cognitively-inspired architecture, featuring modular components for perception, memory, and hierarchical planning over two levels of abstraction. We introduce the Theory of Mind module that scaffolds the high-level planning process by generating hypotheses about other agents' strategies in natural language. It then evaluates and iteratively refines these hypotheses by reinforcing hypotheses that make correct predictions about the other agents' behavior. Hypothetical Minds significantly improves performance over previous LLM-agent and RL baselines on a range of competitive, mixed motive, and collaborative domains in the Melting Pot benchmark, including both dyadic and population-based environments. Additionally, comparisons against LLM-agent baselines and ablations reveal the importance of hypothesis evaluation and refinement for succeeding on complex scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have generated highly successful controllers for a myriad of complex domains. However, the opaque nature of these models limits their applicability in aerospace systems and safety-critical domains, in which a single mistake can have dire consequences. In this paper, we present novel advancements in both the training and verification of DRL controllers, which can help ensure their safe behavior. We showcase a design-for-verification approach utilizing k-induction and demonstrate its use in verifying liveness properties. In addition, we also give a brief overview of neural Lyapunov Barrier certificates and summarize their capabilities on a case study. Finally, we describe several other novel reachability-based approaches which, despite failing to provide guarantees of interest, could be effective for verification of other DRL systems, and could be of further interest to the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaang Li, Yova Kementchedjhieva, Constanza Fierro, Anders S{\o}gaard</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) are said to ``lack the ability to connect utterances to the world'' (Bender and Koller, 2020), because they do not have ``mental models of the world' '(Mitchell and Krakauer, 2023). If so, one would expect LM representations to be unrelated to representations induced by vision models. We present an empirical evaluation across four families of LMs (BERT, GPT-2, OPT and LLaMA-2) and three vision model architectures (ResNet, SegFormer, and MAE). Our experiments show that LMs partially converge towards representations isomorphic to those of vision models, subject to dispersion, polysemy and frequency. This has important implications for both multi-modal processing and the LM understanding debate (Mitchell and Krakauer, 2023).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Messi H. J. Lee, Jacob M. Montgomery, Calvin K. Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, adeptly integrate text and vision modalities. This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability to mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs' advanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of both modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to mitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait associations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories based on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender groups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct, yet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by visual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated as more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping. These findings suggest that VLMs may associate subtle visual cues related to racial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to mitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss its implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as VLMs come to mirror human perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Jiang, Yiran Ling, Binzhu Li, Pengxiang Li, Junming Piao, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation models often struggle with key element loss or semantic confusion in tasks involving Chinese classical poetry.Addressing this issue through fine-tuning models needs considerable training costs. Additionally, manual prompts for re-diffusion adjustments need professional knowledge. To solve this problem, we propose Poetry2Image, an iterative correction framework for images generated from Chinese classical poetry. Utilizing an external poetry dataset, Poetry2Image establishes an automated feedback and correction loop, which enhances the alignment between poetry and image through image generation models and subsequent re-diffusion modifications suggested by large language models (LLM). Using a test set of 200 sentences of Chinese classical poetry, the proposed method--when integrated with five popular image generation models--achieves an average element completeness of 70.63%, representing an improvement of 25.56% over direct image generation. In tests of semantic correctness, our method attains an average semantic consistency of 80.09%. The study not only promotes the dissemination of ancient poetry culture but also offers a reference for similar non-fine-tuning methods to enhance LLM generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) is the practice of clinicians conducting and interpreting ultrasound scans right at the patient's bedside. However, the expertise needed to interpret these images is considerable and may not always be present in emergency situations. This reality makes algorithms such as machine learning classifiers extremely valuable to augment human decisions. POCUS devices are becoming available at a reasonable cost in the size of a mobile phone. The challenge of turning POCUS devices into life-saving tools is that interpretation of ultrasound images requires specialist training and experience. Unfortunately, the difficulty to obtain positive training images represents an important obstacle to building efficient and accurate classifiers. Hence, the problem we try to investigate is how to explore strategies to increase accuracy of classifiers trained with scarce data. We hypothesize that training with a few data instances may not suffice for classifiers to generalize causing them to overfit. Our approach uses an Explainable AI-Augmented approach to help the algorithm learn more from less and potentially help the classifier better generalize.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article investigates a control system within the context of six-generation wireless networks. The control performance optimization confronts the technical challenges that arise from the intricate interactions between communication and control sub-systems, asking for a co-design. Accounting for the system dynamics, we formulate the sequential co-design decision-makings of communication and control over the discrete time horizon as a Markov decision process, for which a practical offline learning framework is proposed. Our proposed framework integrates large language models into the elements of reinforcement learning. We present a case study on the age of semantics-aware communication and control co-design to showcase the potentials from our proposed learning framework. Furthermore, we discuss the open issues remaining to make our proposed offline learning framework feasible for real-world implementations, and highlight the research directions for future explorations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Mokander, Ralph Schroeder</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we sketch a programme for AI driven social theory. We begin by defining what we mean by artificial intelligence (AI) in this context. We then lay out our model for how AI based models can draw on the growing availability of digital data to help test the validity of different social theories based on their predictive power. In doing so, we use the work of Randall Collins and his state breakdown model to exemplify that, already today, AI based models can help synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources, reason about the world, and apply what is known across a wide range of problems in a systematic way. However, we also find that AI driven social theory remains subject to a range of practical, technical, and epistemological limitations. Most critically, existing AI systems lack three essential capabilities needed to advance social theory in ways that are cumulative, holistic, open-ended, and purposeful. These are (1) semanticization, i.e., the ability to develop and operationalize verbal concepts to represent machine-manipulable knowledge, (2) transferability, i.e., the ability to transfer what has been learned in one context to another, and (3) generativity, i.e., the ability to independently create and improve on concepts and models. We argue that if the gaps identified here are addressed by further research, there is no reason why, in the future, the most advanced programme in social theory should not be led by AI-driven cumulative advances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Mokander</p>
<p>Abstract: AI auditing is a rapidly growing field of research and practice. This review article, which doubles as an editorial to Digital Societys topical collection on Auditing of AI, provides an overview of previous work in the field. Three key points emerge from the review. First, contemporary attempts to audit AI systems have much to learn from how audits have historically been structured and conducted in areas like financial accounting, safety engineering and the social sciences. Second, both policymakers and technology providers have an interest in promoting auditing as an AI governance mechanism. Academic researchers can thus fill an important role by studying the feasibility and effectiveness of different AI auditing procedures. Third, AI auditing is an inherently multidisciplinary undertaking, to which substantial contributions have been made by computer scientists and engineers as well as social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and industry practitioners. Reflecting this diversity of perspectives, different approaches to AI auditing have different affordances and constraints. Specifically, a distinction can be made between technology-oriented audits, which focus on the properties and capabilities of AI systems, and process oriented audits, which focus on technology providers governance structures and quality management systems. The next step in the evolution of auditing as an AI governance mechanism, this article concludes, should be the interlinking of these available (and complementary) approaches into structured and holistic procedures to audit not only how AI systems are designed and used but also how they impact users, societies and the natural environment in applied settings over time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can revolutionize how we deploy and operate Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) by enhancing network analytics, anomaly detection, and code generation and significantly increasing the efficiency and reliability of a plethora of O-RAN tasks. In this paper, we present ORAN-Bench-13K, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of O-RAN. Our benchmark consists of 13,952 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions generated from 116 O-RAN specification documents. We leverage a novel three-stage LLM framework, and the questions are categorized into three distinct difficulties to cover a wide spectrum of ORAN-related knowledge. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemini, Chat-GPT, and Mistral. Additionally, we propose ORANSight, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based pipeline that demonstrates superior performance on ORAN-Bench-13K compared to other tested closed-source models. Our findings indicate that current popular LLM models are not proficient in O-RAN, highlighting the need for specialized models. We observed a noticeable performance improvement when incorporating the RAG-based ORANSight pipeline, with a Macro Accuracy of 0.784 and a Weighted Accuracy of 0.776, which was on average 21.55% and 22.59% better than the other tested LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Ruas, Fernando Gallego, Francisco J. Veredas, Francisco M. Couto</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art deep learning entity linking methods rely on extensive human-labelled data, which is costly to acquire. Current datasets are limited in size, leading to inadequate coverage of biomedical concepts and diminished performance when applied to new data. In this work, we propose to automatically generate data to create large-scale training datasets, which allows the exploration of approaches originally developed for the task of extreme multi-label ranking in the biomedical entity linking task. We propose the hybrid X-Linker pipeline that includes different modules to link disease and chemical entity mentions to concepts in the MEDIC and the CTD-Chemical vocabularies, respectively. X-Linker was evaluated on several biomedical datasets: BC5CDR-Disease, BioRED-Disease, NCBI-Disease, BC5CDR-Chemical, BioRED-Chemical, and NLM-Chem, achieving top-1 accuracies of 0.8307, 0.7969, 0.8271, 0.9511, 0.9248, and 0.7895, respectively. X-Linker demonstrated superior performance in three datasets: BC5CDR-Disease, NCBI-Disease, and BioRED-Chemical. In contrast, SapBERT outperformed X-Linker in the remaining three datasets. Both models rely only on the mention string for their operations. The source code of X-Linker and its associated data are publicly available for performing biomedical entity linking without requiring pre-labelled entities with identifiers from specific knowledge organization systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing text-to-video diffusion models rely solely on text-only encoders for their pretraining. This limitation stems from the absence of large-scale multimodal prompt video datasets, resulting in a lack of visual grounding and restricting their versatility and application in multimodal integration. To address this, we construct a large-scale multimodal prompt dataset by employing retrieval methods to pair in-context examples with the given text prompts and then utilize a two-stage training strategy to enable diverse video generation tasks within the same model. In the first stage, we propose a multimodal conditional video generation framework for pretraining on these augmented datasets, establishing a foundational model for grounded video generation. Secondly, we finetune the model from the first stage on three video generation tasks, incorporating multi-modal instructions. This process further refines the model's ability to handle diverse inputs and tasks, ensuring seamless integration of multi-modal information. After this two-stage train-ing process, VIMI demonstrates multimodal understanding capabilities, producing contextually rich and personalized videos grounded in the provided inputs, as shown in Figure 1. Compared to previous visual grounded video generation methods, VIMI can synthesize consistent and temporally coherent videos with large motion while retaining the semantic control. Lastly, VIMI also achieves state-of-the-art text-to-video generation results on UCF101 benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanbo Hu, Bin Liu, Minglei Yin, Yilu Zhou, Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile applications (Apps) could expose children to inappropriate themes such as sexual content, violence, and drug use. Maturity rating offers a quick and effective method for potential users, particularly guardians, to assess the maturity levels of apps. Determining accurate maturity ratings for mobile apps is essential to protect children's health in today's saturated digital marketplace. Existing approaches to maturity rating are either inaccurate (e.g., self-reported rating by developers) or costly (e.g., manual examination). In the literature, there are few text-mining-based approaches to maturity rating. However, each app typically involves multiple modalities, namely app description in the text, and screenshots in the image. In this paper, we present a framework for determining app maturity levels that utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs), specifically ChatGPT-4 Vision. Powered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, our framework systematically leverages ChatGPT-4 to process multimodal app data (i.e., textual descriptions and screenshots) and guide the MLLM model through a step-by-step reasoning pathway from initial content analysis to final maturity rating determination. As a result, through explicitly incorporating CoT reasoning, our framework enables ChatGPT to understand better and apply maturity policies to facilitate maturity rating. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms all baseline models and other fusion strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of data-intensive automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to dysarthric and elderly adult speech is confronted by their mismatch against healthy and nonaged voices, data scarcity and large speaker-level variability. To this end, this paper proposes two novel data-efficient methods to learn homogeneous dysarthric and elderly speaker-level features for rapid, on-the-fly test-time adaptation of DNN/TDNN and Conformer ASR models. These include: 1) speaker-level variance-regularized spectral basis embedding (VR-SBE) features that exploit a special regularization term to enforce homogeneity of speaker features in adaptation; and 2) feature-based learning hidden unit contributions (f-LHUC) transforms that are conditioned on VR-SBE features. Experiments are conducted on four tasks across two languages: the English UASpeech and TORGO dysarthric speech datasets, the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech corpora. The proposed on-the-fly speaker adaptation techniques consistently outperform baseline iVector and xVector adaptation by statistically significant word or character error rate reductions up to 5.32% absolute (18.57% relative) and batch-mode LHUC speaker adaptation by 2.24% absolute (9.20% relative), while operating with real-time factors speeding up to 33.6 times against xVectors during adaptation. The efficacy of the proposed adaptation techniques is demonstrated in a comparison against current ASR technologies including SSL pre-trained systems on UASpeech, where our best system produces a state-of-the-art WER of 23.33%. Analyses show VR-SBE features and f-LHUC transforms are insensitive to speaker-level data quantity in testtime adaptation. T-SNE visualization reveals they have stronger speaker-level homogeneity than baseline iVectors, xVectors and batch-mode LHUC transforms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a continual learning approach named MagMax, which utilizes model merging to enable large pre-trained models to continuously learn from new data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Distinct from traditional continual learning methods that aim to reduce forgetting during task training, MagMax combines sequential fine-tuning with a maximum magnitude weight selection for effective knowledge integration across tasks. Our initial contribution is an extensive examination of model merging techniques, revealing that simple approaches like weight averaging and random weight selection surprisingly hold up well in various continual learning contexts. More importantly, we present MagMax, a novel model-merging strategy that enables continual learning of large pre-trained models for successive tasks. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates the superiority of MagMax in various scenarios, including class- and domain-incremental learning settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-model Markov decision process (MMDP) is a promising framework for computing policies that are robust to parameter uncertainty in MDPs. MMDPs aim to find a policy that maximizes the expected return over a distribution of MDP models. Because MMDPs are NP-hard to solve, most methods resort to approximations. In this paper, we derive the policy gradient of MMDPs and propose CADP, which combines a coordinate ascent method and a dynamic programming algorithm for solving MMDPs. The main innovation of CADP compared with earlier algorithms is to take the coordinate ascent perspective to adjust model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy improvements to a local maximum. A theoretical analysis of CADP proves that it never performs worse than previous dynamic programming algorithms like WSU. Our numerical results indicate that CADP substantially outperforms existing methods on several benchmark problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbo Zhu, Theodor Wulff, Rahul Singh Maharjan, Jinpei Han, Angelo Cangelosi</p>
<p>Abstract: Although attention mechanisms have achieved considerable progress in Transformer-based architectures across various Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains, their inner workings remain to be explored. Existing explainable methods have different emphases but are rather one-sided. They primarily analyse the attention mechanisms or gradient-based attribution while neglecting the magnitudes of input feature values or the skip-connection module. Moreover, they inevitably bring spurious noisy pixel attributions unrelated to the model's decision, hindering humans' trust in the spotted visualization result. Hence, we propose an easy-to-implement but effective way to remedy this flaw: Smooth Noise Norm Attention (SNNA). We weigh the attention by the norm of the transformed value vector and guide the label-specific signal with the attention gradient, then randomly sample the input perturbations and average the corresponding gradients to produce noise-free attribution. Instead of evaluating the explanation method on the binary or multi-class classification tasks like in previous works, we explore the more complex multi-label classification scenario in this work, i.e., the driving action prediction task, and trained a model for it specifically. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show the superiority of SNNA compared to other SOTA attention-based explainable methods in generating a clearer visual explanation map and ranking the input pixel importance.</p>

We conduct two sets of in-context recall experiments designed to elicit fan effects. Consistent with human results, we find that LLM recall uncertainty, measured via token probability, is influenced by the fan effect. Our results show that removing uncertainty disrupts the observed effect. The experiments suggest the fan effect is consistent whether the fan value is induced in-context or in the pre-training data. Finally, these findings provide in-silico evidence that fan effects and typicality are expressions of the same phenomena.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) investigates how quantum phenomena can be exploited in order to learn data in an alternative way, \textit{e.g.} by means of a quantum computer. While recent results evidence that QML models can potentially surpass their classical counterparts' performance in specific tasks, quantum technology hardware is still unready to reach quantum advantage in tasks of significant relevance to the broad scope of the computer science community. Recent advances indicate that hybrid classical-quantum models can readily attain competitive performances at low architecture complexities. Such investigations are often carried out for image-processing tasks, and are notably constrained to modelling \textit{raster images}, represented as a grid of two-dimensional pixels. Here, we introduce vector-based representation of sketch drawings as a test-bed for QML models. Such a lower-dimensional data structure results handful to benchmark model's performance, particularly in current transition times, where classical simulations of quantum circuits are naturally limited in the number of qubits, and quantum hardware is not readily available to perform large-scale experiments. We report some encouraging results for primitive hybrid classical-quantum architectures, in a canonical sketch recognition problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Yoffe, Alfonso Amayuelas, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, multi-agent debates have been introduced, where multiple LLMs discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, LLMs often produce incorrect responses that appear deceptively confident, which can mislead other agents. This is partly because agents do not express their confidence levels during standard debates. To address this, we introduce DebUnc, a multi-agent debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence levels. We adapted the LLM attention mechanism to adjust token weights based on confidence levels and also explored using textual prompts to convey confidence. Our evaluations across various benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective, and that as uncertainty metrics evolve, performance will continue to increase.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyagna Bavikadi, Dyuman Aditya, Devendra Parkar, Paulo Shakarian, Graham Mueller, Chad Parvis, Gerardo I. Simari</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to generate artificial human movement patterns while meeting location and time constraints is an important problem in the security community, particularly as it enables the study of the analog problem of detecting such patterns while maintaining privacy. We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the forefront of neuromorphic computing, promising energy-efficient and biologically plausible models for complex tasks. This paper weaves together three groundbreaking studies that revolutionize SNN performance through the introduction of heterogeneity in neuron and synapse dynamics. We explore the transformative impact of Heterogeneous Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (HRSNNs), supported by rigorous analytical frameworks and novel pruning methods like Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP). Our findings reveal how heterogeneity not only enhances classification performance but also reduces spiking activity, leading to more efficient and robust networks. By bridging theoretical insights with practical applications, this comprehensive summary highlights the potential of SNNs to outperform traditional neural networks while maintaining lower computational costs. Join us on a journey through the cutting-edge advancements that pave the way for the future of intelligent, energy-efficient neural computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Yu, Qidi Fang, Shijie Fang, Reuben M. Aronson, Elaine Schaertl Short</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the expressiveness of human teaching is vital for both improving robots' learning from humans and the human-teaching-robot experience. In this work, we characterize and test a little-used teaching signal: \textit{progress}, designed to represent the completion percentage of a task. We conducted two online studies with 76 crowd-sourced participants and one public space study with 40 non-expert participants to validate the capability of this progress signal. We find that progress indicates whether the task is successfully performed, reflects the degree of task completion, identifies unproductive but harmless behaviors, and is likely to be more consistent across participants. Furthermore, our results show that giving progress does not require extra workload and time. An additional contribution of our work is a dataset of 40 non-expert demonstrations from the public space study through an ice cream topping-adding task, which we observe to be multi-policy and sub-optimal, with sub-optimality not only from teleoperation errors but also from exploratory actions and attempts. The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/TeachingwithProgress/Non-Expert\_Demonstrations}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Shi, Jaechan Lee, Yangsibo Huang, Sadhika Malladi, Jieyu Zhao, Ari Holtzman, Daogao Liu, Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah A. Smith, Chiyuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) are trained on vast amounts of text data, which may include private and copyrighted content. Data owners may request the removal of their data from a trained model due to privacy or copyright concerns. However, exactly unlearning only these datapoints (i.e., retraining with the data removed) is intractable in modern-day models. This has led to the development of many approximate unlearning algorithms. The evaluation of the efficacy of these algorithms has traditionally been narrow in scope, failing to precisely quantify the success and practicality of the algorithm from the perspectives of both the model deployers and the data owners. We address this issue by proposing MUSE, a comprehensive machine unlearning evaluation benchmark that enumerates six diverse desirable properties for unlearned models: (1) no verbatim memorization, (2) no knowledge memorization, (3) no privacy leakage, (4) utility preservation on data not intended for removal, (5) scalability with respect to the size of removal requests, and (6) sustainability over sequential unlearning requests. Using these criteria, we benchmark how effectively eight popular unlearning algorithms on 7B-parameter LMs can unlearn Harry Potter books and news articles. Our results demonstrate that most algorithms can prevent verbatim memorization and knowledge memorization to varying degrees, but only one algorithm does not lead to severe privacy leakage. Furthermore, existing algorithms fail to meet deployer's expectations because they often degrade general model utility and also cannot sustainably accommodate successive unlearning requests or large-scale content removal. Our findings identify key issues with the practicality of existing unlearning algorithms on language models, and we release our benchmark to facilitate further evaluations: muse-bench.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Liu, Bin Guo, Nuo Li, Yasan Ding, Zhouyangzi Zhang, Zhiwen Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is an emerging frontier based on the deep fusion of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Although advanced deep learning techniques enhance the efficient data processing and intelligent analysis of complex IoT data, they still suffer from notable challenges when deployed to practical AIoT applications, such as constrained resources, and diverse task requirements. Knowledge transfer is an effective method to enhance learning performance by avoiding the exorbitant costs associated with data recollection and model retraining. Notably, although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances of various knowledge transfer techniques for AIoT field. This survey endeavors to introduce a new concept of knowledge transfer, referred to as Crowd Knowledge Transfer (CrowdTransfer), which aims to transfer prior knowledge learned from a crowd of agents to reduce the training cost and as well as improve the performance of the model in real-world complicated scenarios. Particularly, we present four transfer modes from the perspective of crowd intelligence, including derivation, sharing, evolution and fusion modes. Building upon conventional transfer learning methods, we further delve into advanced crowd knowledge transfer models from three perspectives for various AIoT applications. Furthermore, we explore some applications of AIoT areas, such as human activity recognition, urban computing, multi-robot system, and smart factory. Finally, we discuss the open issues and outline future research directions of knowledge transfer in AIoT community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Wei, Peiyan Hu, Ruiqi Feng, Haodong Feng, Yixuan Du, Tao Zhang, Rui Wang, Yue Wang, Zhi-Ming Ma, Tailin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and identify near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method in 1D Burgers' equation and 2D jellyfish movement control in a fluid environment. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Liu, Qianyu Zhang, Xue Wan, Shengyang Zhang, Yaolin Tian, Haodong Han, Yutao Zhao, Baichuan Liu, Zeyuan Zhao, Xubo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the complexity of lunar exploration missions, the moon needs to have a higher level of autonomy. Environmental perception and navigation algorithms are the foundation for lunar rovers to achieve autonomous exploration. The development and verification of algorithms require highly reliable data support. Most of the existing lunar datasets are targeted at a single task, lacking diverse scenes and high-precision ground truth labels. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task, multi-scene, and multi-label lunar benchmark dataset LuSNAR. This dataset can be used for comprehensive evaluation of autonomous perception and navigation systems, including high-resolution stereo image pairs, panoramic semantic labels, dense depth maps, LiDAR point clouds, and the position of rover. In order to provide richer scene data, we built 9 lunar simulation scenes based on Unreal Engine. Each scene is divided according to topographic relief and the density of objects. To verify the usability of the dataset, we evaluated and analyzed the algorithms of semantic segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. The experiment results prove that the dataset proposed in this paper can be used for ground verification of tasks such as autonomous environment perception and navigation, and provides a lunar benchmark dataset for testing the accessibility of algorithm metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachneet Kaur, Zhen Zeng, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngkyung Seo, Yoonseok Heo, Jun-Seok Koh, Du-Seoung Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-session dialog system, it is essential to continuously update the memory as the session progresses. Simply accumulating memory can make it difficult to focus on the content of the conversation for inference due to the limited input sentence size. Therefore, efficient and accurate conversation model that is capable of managing memory to reflect the conversation history continuously is necessary. This paper presents a conversation model that efficiently manages memory as sessions progress and incorporates this into the model to reflect the conversation history accurately with 3 methodologies: SFT, DPO and DPO with SFT model. Our model using DPO algorithm shows an improvement about 0.0591 of BERTScore in memory accuracy, and the rate of responses reflecting the memory increased as well. Also, response generation performance enhanced about 4.292 in fluency, 3.935 in coherence, and 2.896 in consistency. This paper describes a training method that yields better performance than models with more than twice the parameter size, even when the model size is smaller. Thus, our model demonstrates efficiency not only in terms of accuracy but also in resource utilization.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present GvSeg, a general video segmentation framework for addressing four different video segmentation tasks (i.e., instance, semantic, panoptic, and exemplar-guided) while maintaining an identical architectural design. Currently, there is a trend towards developing general video segmentation solutions that can be applied across multiple tasks. This streamlines research endeavors and simplifies deployment. However, such a highly homogenized framework in current design, where each element maintains uniformity, could overlook the inherent diversity among different tasks and lead to suboptimal performance. To tackle this, GvSeg: i) provides a holistic disentanglement and modeling for segment targets, thoroughly examining them from the perspective of appearance, position, and shape, and on this basis, ii) reformulates the query initialization, matching and sampling strategies in alignment with the task-specific requirement. These architecture-agnostic innovations empower GvSeg to effectively address each unique task by accommodating the specific properties that characterize them. Extensive experiments on seven gold-standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that GvSeg surpasses all existing specialized/general solutions by a significant margin on four different video segmentation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ads relevance models are crucial in determining the relevance between user search queries and ad offers, often framed as a classification problem. The complexity of modeling increases significantly with multiple ad types and varying scenarios that exhibit both similarities and differences. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-faceted attention model that performs task aware feature combination and cross task interaction modeling. Our technique formulates the feature combination problem as "language" modeling with auto-regressive attentions across both feature and task dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a new dimension of task ID encoding for task representations, thereby enabling precise relevance modeling across diverse ad scenarios with substantial improvement in generality capability for unseen tasks. We demonstrate that our model not only effectively handles the increased computational and maintenance demands as scenarios proliferate, but also outperforms generalized DNN models and even task-specific models across a spectrum of ad applications using a single unified model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanglin Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis poses a major global health threat, accounting for millions of deaths annually and significant economic costs. Accurate predictions of mortality risk in sepsis patients facilitate the efficient allocation of medical resources, thereby enhancing patient survival and quality of life. Through precise risk assessments, healthcare facilities can effectively distribute intensive care beds, medical equipment, and staff, ensuring high-risk patients receive timely and appropriate care. Early identification and intervention significantly decrease mortality rates and improve patient outcomes. Current methods typically utilize only one type of data--either constant, temporal, or ICD codes. This study introduces the Time-Constant KAN Integrated Network(TCKIN), an innovative model that enhances the accuracy of sepsis mortality risk predictions by integrating both temporal and constant data from electronic health records and ICD codes. Validated against the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, TCKIN surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning methods in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Notably, TCKIN achieved AUCs of 87.76% and 88.07%, demonstrating superior capability in identifying high-risk patients. Additionally, TCKIN effectively combats the prevalent issue of data imbalance in clinical settings, improving the detection of patients at elevated risk of mortality and facilitating timely interventions. These results confirm the model's effectiveness and its potential to transform patient management and treatment optimization in clinical practice. With this advanced risk assessment tool, healthcare providers can devise more tailored treatment plans, optimize resource utilization, and ultimately enhance survival rates and quality of life for sepsis patients.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has played a significant role in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as chatbots, text generation, and language translation. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has greatly improved the performance of these applications, showing astonishing results in language understanding and generation. However, they still show some disadvantages, such as hallucinations and lack of domain-specific knowledge, that affect their performance in real-world tasks. These issues can be effectively mitigated by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which organise information in structured formats that capture relationships between entities in a versatile and interpretable fashion. Likewise, the construction and validation of KGs present challenges that LLMs can help resolve. The complementary relationship between LLMs and KGs has led to a trend that combines these technologies to achieve trustworthy results. This work collected 28 papers outlining methods for KG-powered LLMs, LLM-based KGs, and LLM-KG hybrid approaches. We systematically analysed and compared these approaches to provide a comprehensive overview highlighting key trends, innovative techniques, and common challenges. This synthesis will benefit researchers new to the field and those seeking to deepen their understanding of how KGs and LLMs can be effectively combined to enhance AI applications capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained from vast repositories of text authored by millions of distinct authors, reflecting an enormous diversity of human traits. While these models bear the potential to be used as approximations of human subjects in behavioral studies, prior efforts have been limited in steering model responses to match individual human users. In this work, we introduce "Anthology", a method for conditioning LLMs to particular virtual personas by harnessing open-ended life narratives, which we refer to as "backstories." We show that our methodology enhances the consistency and reliability of experimental outcomes while ensuring better representation of diverse sub-populations. Across three nationally representative human surveys conducted as part of Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), we demonstrate that Anthology achieves up to 18% improvement in matching the response distributions of human respondents and 27% improvement in consistency metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlong Peng, Zhigang Wang, Yisheng Zhang, Shengmin Zhang, Nan Cai, Fan Wu, Ming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficient disassembly of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries(EOL-EVBs) is crucial for green manufacturing and sustainable development. The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%. This research attempts to use NeuroSymbolic AI to give robots real autonomous reasoning, planning, and learning capabilities. BEAM-1 realizes the revolution of battery disassembly. Its framework can be easily ported to any robotic system to realize different application scenarios, which provides a ground-breaking idea for the design and implementation of future embodied intelligent robotic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present CEIA, an effective framework for open-world event-based understanding. Currently training a large event-text model still poses a huge challenge due to the shortage of paired event-text data. In response to this challenge, CEIA learns to align event and image data as an alternative instead of directly aligning event and text data. Specifically, we leverage the rich event-image datasets to learn an event embedding space aligned with the image space of CLIP through contrastive learning. In this way, event and text data are naturally aligned via using image data as a bridge. Particularly, CEIA offers two distinct advantages. First, it allows us to take full advantage of the existing event-image datasets to make up the shortage of large-scale event-text datasets. Second, leveraging more training data, it also exhibits the flexibility to boost performance, ensuring scalable capability. In highlighting the versatility of our framework, we make extensive evaluations through a diverse range of event-based multi-modal applications, such as object recognition, event-image retrieval, event-text retrieval, and domain adaptation. The outcomes demonstrate CEIA's distinct zero-shot superiority over existing methods on these applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan He, Weichen Xiong, Hanwen Liu, Yi Liao, Lei Ding, Kai Zhang, Guohua Tang, Xiao Han, Wei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by duplicated data in their extensive pre-training datasets. Current approaches primarily focus on detecting and removing duplicates, which risks the loss of valuable information and neglects the varying degrees of duplication. To address this, we propose a soft deduplication method that maintains dataset integrity while selectively reducing the sampling weight of data with high commonness. Central to our approach is the concept of "data commonness", a metric we introduce to quantify the degree of duplication by measuring the occurrence probabilities of samples using an n-gram model. Empirical analysis shows that this method significantly improves training efficiency, achieving comparable perplexity scores with at least a 26% reduction in required training steps. Additionally, it enhances average few-shot downstream accuracy by 1.77% when trained for an equivalent duration. Importantly, this approach consistently improves performance, even on rigorously deduplicated datasets, indicating its potential to complement existing methods and become a standard pre-training process for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyeong Taek Lee, Oh-Ran Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: In the manufacturing process, sensor data collected from equipment is crucial for building predictive models to manage processes and improve productivity. However, in the field, it is challenging to gather sufficient data to build robust models. This study proposes a novel predictive model based on the Transformer, utilizing statistical feature embedding and window positional encoding. Statistical features provide an effective representation of sensor data, and the embedding enables the Transformer to learn both time- and sensor-related information. Window positional encoding captures precise time details from the feature embedding. The model's performance is evaluated in two problems: fault detection and virtual metrology, showing superior results compared to baseline models. This improvement is attributed to the efficient use of parameters, which is particularly beneficial for sensor data that often has limited sample sizes. The results support the model's applicability across various manufacturing industries, demonstrating its potential for enhancing process management and yield.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillermo Infante, Anders Jonsson, Vicen\c{c} G\'omez</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning for Linearly-solvable Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs) in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting. Unlike previous work, our approach allows learning low-level and high-level tasks simultaneously, without imposing limiting restrictions on the low-level tasks. Our method relies on partitions of the state space that create smaller subtasks that are easier to solve, and the equivalence between such partitions to learn more efficiently. We then exploit the compositionality of low-level tasks to exactly represent the value function of the high-level task. Experiments show that our approach can outperform flat average-reward reinforcement learning by one or several orders of magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isuru Wijesinghe, Michael Nix, Arezoo Zakeri, Alireza Hokmabadi, Bashar Al-Qaisieh, Ali Gooya, Zeike A. Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Deep-Motion-Net: an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) architecture that enables 3D (volumetric) organ shape reconstruction from a single in-treatment kV planar X-ray image acquired at any arbitrary projection angle. Estimating and compensating for true anatomical motion during radiotherapy is essential for improving the delivery of planned radiation dose to target volumes while sparing organs-at-risk, and thereby improving the therapeutic ratio. Achieving this using only limited imaging available during irradiation and without the use of surrogate signals or invasive fiducial markers is attractive. The proposed model learns the mesh regression from a patient-specific template and deep features extracted from kV images at arbitrary projection angles. A 2D-CNN encoder extracts image features, and four feature pooling networks fuse these features to the 3D template organ mesh. A ResNet-based graph attention network then deforms the feature-encoded mesh. The model is trained using synthetically generated organ motion instances and corresponding kV images. The latter is generated by deforming a reference CT volume aligned with the template mesh, creating digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) at required projection angles, and DRR-to-kV style transferring with a conditional CycleGAN model. The overall framework was tested quantitatively on synthetic respiratory motion scenarios and qualitatively on in-treatment images acquired over full scan series for liver cancer patients. Overall mean prediction errors for synthetic motion test datasets were 0.16$\pm$0.13 mm, 0.18$\pm$0.19 mm, 0.22$\pm$0.34 mm, and 0.12$\pm$0.11 mm. Mean peak prediction errors were 1.39 mm, 1.99 mm, 3.29 mm, and 1.16 mm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Guan Hsieh, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Shih-Ying Yeh, Louis B\'ethune, Hadi Pour Ansari, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu, Chun-Liang Li, Ranjay Krishna, Oncel Tuzel, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans describe complex scenes with compositionality, using simple text descriptions enriched with links and relationships. While vision-language research has aimed to develop models with compositional understanding capabilities, this is not reflected yet in existing datasets which, for the most part, still use plain text to describe images. In this work, we propose a new annotation strategy, graph-based captioning (GBC) that describes an image using a labelled graph structure, with nodes of various types. The nodes in GBC are created using, in a first stage, object detection and dense captioning tools nested recursively to uncover and describe entity nodes, further linked together in a second stage by highlighting, using new types of nodes, compositions and relations among entities. Since all GBC nodes hold plain text descriptions, GBC retains the flexibility found in natural language, but can also encode hierarchical information in its edges. We demonstrate that GBC can be produced automatically, using off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs and open-vocabulary detection models, by building a new dataset, GBC10M, gathering GBC annotations for about 10M images of the CC12M dataset. We use GBC10M to showcase the wealth of node captions uncovered by GBC, as measured with CLIP training. We show that using GBC nodes' annotations -- notably those stored in composition and relation nodes -- results in significant performance boost on downstream models when compared to other dataset formats. To further explore the opportunities provided by GBC, we also propose a new attention mechanism that can leverage the entire GBC graph, with encouraging experimental results that show the extra benefits of incorporating the graph structure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Alvaro Fern\'andez-Campa-Gonz\'alez, Jorge Paz-Ruza, Amparo Alonso-Betanzos, Bertha Guijarro-Berdi\~nas</p>
<p>Abstract: Among the existing approaches for visual-based Recommender System (RS) explainability, utilizing user-uploaded item images as efficient, trustable explanations is a promising option. However, current models following this paradigm assume that, for any user, all images uploaded by other users can be considered negative training examples (i.e. bad explanatory images), an inadvertedly naive labelling assumption that contradicts the rationale of the approach. This work proposes a new explainer training pipeline by leveraging Positive-Unlabelled (PU) Learning techniques to train image-based explainer with refined subsets of reliable negative examples for each user selected through a novel user-personalized, two-step, similarity-based PU Learning algorithm. Computational experiments show this PU-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art non-PU method in six popular real-world datasets, proving that an improvement of visual-based RS explainability can be achieved by maximizing training data quality rather than increasing model complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanli Li, Jifei Hu, Zhongliang Guo, Nan Yang, Huaming Chen, Dong Yuan, Weiping Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers innovative solutions for privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning (ML). Despite its promising potential, FL is vulnerable to various attacks due to its distributed nature, affecting the entire life cycle of FL services. These threats can harm the model's utility or compromise participants' privacy, either directly or indirectly. In response, numerous defense frameworks have been proposed, demonstrating effectiveness in specific settings and scenarios. To provide a clear understanding of the current research landscape, this paper reviews the most representative and state-of-the-art threats and defense frameworks throughout the FL service life cycle. We start by identifying FL threats that harm utility and privacy, including those with potential or direct impacts. Then, we dive into the defense frameworks, analyze the relationship between threats and defenses, and compare the trade-offs among different defense strategies. Finally, we summarize current research bottlenecks and offer insights into future research directions to conclude this survey. We hope this survey sheds light on trustworthy FL research and contributes to the FL community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Augustine N. Mavor-Parker, Matthew J. Sargent, Caswell Barry, Lewis Griffin, Clare Lyle</p>
<p>Abstract: Periodic activation functions, often referred to as learned Fourier features have been widely demonstrated to improve sample efficiency and stability in a variety of deep RL algorithms. Potentially incompatible hypotheses have been made about the source of these improvements. One is that periodic activations learn low frequency representations and as a result avoid overfitting to bootstrapped targets. Another is that periodic activations learn high frequency representations that are more expressive, allowing networks to quickly fit complex value functions. We analyse these claims empirically, finding that periodic representations consistently converge to high frequencies regardless of their initialisation frequency. We also find that while periodic activation functions improve sample efficiency, they exhibit worse generalization on states with added observation noise -- especially when compared to otherwise equivalent networks with ReLU activation functions. Finally, we show that weight decay regularization is able to partially offset the overfitting of periodic activation functions, delivering value functions that learn quickly while also generalizing.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider nonlinear networks as perturbations of linear ones. Based on this approach, we present novel generalization bounds that become non-vacuous for networks that are close to being linear. The main advantage over the previous works which propose non-vacuous generalization bounds is that our bounds are a-priori: performing the actual training is not required for evaluating the bounds. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first non-vacuous generalization bounds for neural nets possessing this property.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Zhang, Nabil Moukafih, Hamad Alamri, Gregory Epiphaniou, Carsten Maple</p>
<p>Abstract: Since its implementation in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has prompted businesses to revisit and revise their data handling practices to ensure compliance. The privacy policy, which serves as the primary means of informing users about their privacy rights and the data practices of companies, has been significantly updated by numerous businesses post-GDPR implementation. However, many privacy policies remain packed with technical jargon, lengthy explanations, and vague descriptions of data practices and user rights. This makes it a challenging task for users and regulatory authorities to manually verify the GDPR compliance of these privacy policies. In this study, we aim to address the challenge of compliance analysis between GDPR (Article 13) and privacy policies for 5G networks. We manually collected privacy policies from almost 70 different 5G MNOs, and we utilized an automated BERT-based model for classification. We show that an encouraging 51$\%$ of companies demonstrate a strong adherence to GDPR. In addition, we present the first study that provides current empirical evidence on the readability of privacy policies for 5G network. we adopted readability analysis toolset that incorporates various established readability metrics. The findings empirically show that the readability of the majority of current privacy policies remains a significant challenge. Hence, 5G providers need to invest considerable effort into revising these documents to enhance both their utility and the overall user experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashok Dahal, Luigi Lombardo</p>
<p>Abstract: For decades, solutions to regional scale landslide prediction have mostly relied on data-driven models, by definition, disconnected from the physics of the failure mechanism. The success and spread of such tools came from the ability to exploit proxy variables rather than explicit geotechnical ones, as the latter are prohibitive to acquire over broad landscapes. Our work implements a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach, thereby adding to a standard data-driven architecture, an intermediate constraint to solve for the permanent deformation typical of Newmark slope stability methods. This translates into a neural network tasked with explicitly retrieving geotechnical parameters from common proxy variables and then minimize a loss function with respect to the available coseismic landside inventory. The results are very promising, because our model not only produces excellent predictive performance in the form of standard susceptibility output, but in the process, also generates maps of the expected geotechnical properties at a regional scale. Such architecture is therefore framed to tackle coseismic landslide prediction, something that, if confirmed in other studies, could open up towards PINN-based near-real-time predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fotios Lygerakis, Elmar Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are constrained by the limitations of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) formulation, particularly when utilizing simplistic, non-analytic, or unknown prior distributions. These limitations inhibit the VAE's ability to generate high-quality samples and provide clear, interpretable latent representations. This work introduces the Entropy Decomposed Variational Autoencoder (ED-VAE), a novel re-formulation of the ELBO that explicitly includes entropy and cross-entropy components. This reformulation significantly enhances model flexibility, allowing for the integration of complex and non-standard priors. By providing more detailed control over the encoding and regularization of latent spaces, ED-VAE not only improves interpretability but also effectively captures the complex interactions between latent variables and observed data, thus leading to better generative performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Harasta, Tereza Novotn\'a, Jaromir Savelka</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a future in which certain types of legal documents may be generated automatically. This has a great potential to streamline legal processes, lower the cost of legal services, and dramatically increase access to justice. While many researchers focus their efforts on proposing and evaluating LLM-based applications supporting tasks in the legal domain, there is a notable lack of investigations into how legal professionals perceive content if they believe it has been generated by an LLM. Yet, this is a critical point as over-reliance or unfounded skepticism may influence whether such documents bring about appropriate legal consequences. This study is the necessary analysis in the context of the ongoing transition towards mature generative AI systems. Specifically, we examined whether the perception of legal documents' by lawyers (n=75) varies based on their assumed origin (human-crafted vs AI-generated). The participants evaluated the documents focusing on their correctness and language quality. Our analysis revealed a clear preference for documents perceived as crafted by a human over those believed to be generated by AI. At the same time, most of the participants are expecting the future in which documents will be generated automatically. These findings could be leveraged by legal practitioners, policy makers and legislators to implement and adopt legal document generation technology responsibly, and to fuel the necessary discussions into how legal processes should be updated to reflect the recent technological developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Philipp Klein, Thomas B\"ack, Anna V. Kononova</p>
<p>Abstract: As attention to recorded data grows in the realm of automotive testing and manual evaluation reaches its limits, there is a growing need for automatic online anomaly detection. This real-world data is complex in many ways and requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) represents one of the most pressing challenges in the field of neurodegenerative disorders, with its progression analysis being crucial for understanding disease dynamics and developing targeted interventions. Recent advancements in deep learning and various representation learning strategies, including self-supervised learning (SSL), have shown significant promise in enhancing medical image analysis, providing innovative ways to extract meaningful patterns from complex data. Notably, the computer vision literature has demonstrated that incorporating supervisory signals into SSL can further augment model performance by guiding the learning process with additional relevant information. However, the application of such supervisory signals in the context of disease progression analysis remains largely unexplored. This gap is particularly pronounced given the inherent challenges of incorporating both event and time-to-event information into the learning paradigm. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework, Time and Even-aware SSL (TE-SSL), which integrates time-to-event and event data as supervisory signals to refine the learning process. Our comparative analysis with existing SSL-based methods in the downstream task of survival analysis shows superior performance across standard metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: While the biases of language models in production are extensively documented, the biases of their guardrails have been neglected. This paper studies how contextual information about the user influences the likelihood of an LLM to refuse to execute a request. By generating user biographies that offer ideological and demographic information, we find a number of biases in guardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5. Younger, female, and Asian-American personas are more likely to trigger a refusal guardrail when requesting censored or illegal information. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusing to comply with requests for a political position the user is likely to disagree with. We find that certain identity groups and seemingly innocuous information, e.g., sports fandom, can elicit changes in guardrail sensitivity similar to direct statements of political ideology. For each demographic category and even for American football team fandom, we find that ChatGPT appears to infer a likely political ideology and modify guardrail behavior accordingly.</p>

Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahana Ibrahim, Panagiotis A. Traganitis, Xiao Fu, Georgios B. Giannakis</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the primary catalysts fueling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is the availability of massive, curated datasets. A commonly used technique to curate such massive datasets is crowdsourcing, where data are dispatched to multiple annotators. The annotator-produced labels are then fused to serve downstream learning and inference tasks. This annotation process often creates noisy labels due to various reasons, such as the limited expertise, or unreliability of annotators, among others. Therefore, a core objective in crowdsourcing is to develop methods that effectively mitigate the negative impact of such label noise on learning tasks. This feature article introduces advances in learning from noisy crowdsourced labels. The focus is on key crowdsourcing models and their methodological treatments, from classical statistical models to recent deep learning-based approaches, emphasizing analytical insights and algorithmic developments. In particular, this article reviews the connections between signal processing (SP) theory and methods, such as identifiability of tensor and nonnegative matrix factorization, and novel, principled solutions of longstanding challenges in crowdsourcing -- showing how SP perspectives drive the advancements of this field. Furthermore, this article touches upon emerging topics that are critical for developing cutting-edge AI/ML systems, such as crowdsourcing in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) that are key techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in controlled airspace presents significant risks, including potential collisions, disruptions to air traffic, and security threats. Ensuring the safe and efficient operation of airspace, particularly in urban environments and near critical infrastructure, necessitates effective methods to intercept unauthorized or non-cooperative UAVs. This work addresses the critical need for robust, adaptive systems capable of managing such threats through the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We present a novel approach utilizing RL to train fixed-wing UAV pursuer agents for intercepting dynamic evader targets. Our methodology explores both model-based and model-free RL algorithms, specifically DreamerV3, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The training and evaluation of these algorithms were conducted under diverse scenarios, including unseen evasion strategies and environmental perturbations. Our approach leverages high-fidelity flight dynamics simulations to create realistic training environments. This research underscores the importance of developing intelligent, adaptive control systems for UAV interception, significantly contributing to the advancement of secure and efficient airspace management. It demonstrates the potential of RL to train systems capable of autonomously achieving these critical tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manpreet Singh, Ravdeep Pasricha, Ravi Prasad Kondapalli, Kiran R, Nitish Singh, Akshita Agarwalla, Manoj R, Manish Prabhakar, Laurent Bou\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most critical tasks of Microsoft sellers is to meticulously track and nurture potential business opportunities through proactive engagement and tailored solutions. Recommender systems play a central role to help sellers achieve their goals. In this paper, we present a content recommendation model which surfaces various types of content (technical documentation, comparison with competitor products, customer success stories etc.) that sellers can share with their customers or use for their own self-learning. The model operates at the opportunity level which is the lowest possible granularity and the most relevant one for sellers. It is based on semantic matching between metadata from the contents and carefully selected attributes of the opportunities. Considering the volume of seller-managed opportunities in organizations such as Microsoft, we show how to perform efficient semantic matching over a very large number of opportunity-content combinations. The main challenge is to ensure that the top-5 relevant contents for each opportunity are recommended out of a total of $\approx 40,000$ published contents. We achieve this target through an extensive comparison of different model architectures and feature selection. Finally, we further examine the quality of the recommendations in a quantitative manner using a combination of human domain experts as well as by using the recently proposed "LLM as a judge" framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Manil Bendali, Samir Ferroum, Ekaterina Kozachenko, Youssef Parviz, Hanna Shcharbakova, Anna Tokareva, Shemair Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of writing rap is challenging and involves producing complex rhyming schemes, yet meaningful lyrics. In this work, we propose Raply, a fine-tuned GPT-2 model capable of producing meaningful rhyming text in the style of rap. In addition to its rhyming capabilities, the model is able to generate less offensive content. It was achieved through the fine-tuning the model on a new dataset Mitislurs, a profanity-mitigated corpus. We evaluate the output of the model on two criteria: 1) rhyming based on the rhyme density metric; 2) profanity content, using the list of profanities for the English language. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at profanity mitigation for rap lyrics generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim R. Davidson, Viacheslav Surkov, Veniamin Veselovsky, Giuseppe Russo, Robert West, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: A rapidly growing number of applications rely on a small set of closed-source language models (LMs). This dependency might introduce novel security risks if LMs develop self-recognition capabilities. Inspired by human identity verification methods, we propose a novel approach for assessing self-recognition in LMs using model-generated "security questions". Our test can be externally administered to keep track of frontier models as it does not require access to internal model parameters or output probabilities. We use our test to examine self-recognition in ten of the most capable open- and closed-source LMs currently publicly available. Our extensive experiments found no empirical evidence of general or consistent self-recognition in any examined LM. Instead, our results suggest that given a set of alternatives, LMs seek to pick the "best" answer, regardless of its origin. Moreover, we find indications that preferences about which models produce the best answers are consistent across LMs. We additionally uncover novel insights on position bias considerations for LMs in multiple-choice settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krzysztof Kutt (Jagiellonian University), Jakub Gomu{\l}ka (AGH University of Krakow), Luiz do Valle Miranda (Jagiellonian University), Grzegorz J. Nalepa (Jagiellonian University)</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to several cultural heritage initiatives at the Jagiellonian University, we have developed a new digitization workflow in collaboration with the Jagiellonian Library (JL). The solution is based on easy-to-access technological solutions -- Microsoft 365 cloud with MS Excel files as metadata acquisition interfaces, Office Script for validation, and MS Sharepoint for storage -- that allows metadata acquisition by domain experts (philologists, historians, philosophers, librarians, archivists, curators, etc.) regardless of their experience with information systems. The ultimate goal is to create a knowledge graph that describes the analyzed holdings, linked to general knowledge bases, as well as to other cultural heritage collections, so careful attention is paid to the high accuracy of metadata and proper links to external sources. The workflow has already been evaluated in two pilots in the DiHeLib project focused on digitizing the so-called "Berlin Collection" and in two workshops with international guests, which allowed for its refinement and confirmation of its correctness and usability for JL. As the proposed workflow does not interfere with existing systems or domain guidelines regarding digitization and basic metadata collection in a given institution (e.g., file type, image quality, use of Dublin Core/MARC-21), but extends them in order to enable rich metadata collection, not previously possible, we believe that it could be of interest to all GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums).</p>

<p>Abstract: As part of ongoing research projects, three Jagiellonian University units -- the Jagiellonian University Museum, the Jagiellonian University Archives, and the Jagiellonian Library -- are collaborating to digitize cultural heritage documents, describe them in detail, and then integrate these descriptions into a linked data cloud.

In this paper, we present a report on the current status of the work, in which we outline the most important requirements for the data model under development and then make a detailed comparison with the two standards that are the most relevant from the point of view of collections: Europeana Data Model used in Europeana and Encoded Archival Description used in Kalliope.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Tonks, Cuong Nguyer, Steve Hood, Ryan Musso, Ceridwen Hopely, Steve Titus, Minh Doan, Iain Styles, Alexander Krull</p>
<p>Abstract: The large volume and variety of imaging data from high-throughput screening (HTS) in the pharmaceutical industry present an excellent resource for training virtual staining models. However, the potential of models trained under one set of experimental conditions to generalize to other conditions remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates whether data from three cell types (lung, ovarian, and breast) and two phenotypes (toxic and non-toxic conditions) commonly found in HTS can effectively train virtual staining models to generalize across three typical HTS distribution shifts: unseen phenotypes, unseen cell types, and the combination of both. Utilizing a dataset of 772,416 paired bright-field, cytoplasm, nuclei, and DNA-damage stain images, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across pixel-based, instance-wise, and biological-feature-based levels. Our findings indicate that training virtual nuclei and cytoplasm models on non-toxic condition samples not only generalizes to toxic condition samples but leads to improved performance across all evaluation levels compared to training on toxic condition samples. Generalization to unseen cell types shows variability depending on the cell type; models trained on ovarian or lung cell samples often perform well under other conditions, while those trained on breast cell samples consistently show poor generalization. Generalization to unseen cell types and phenotypes shows good generalization across all levels of evaluation compared to addressing unseen cell types alone. This study represents the first large-scale, data-centric analysis of the generalization capability of virtual staining models trained on diverse HTS datasets, providing valuable strategies for experimental training data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-An Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in neural information retrieval (IR) models have significantly enhanced their effectiveness over various IR tasks. The robustness of these models, essential for ensuring their reliability in practice, has also garnered significant attention. With a wide array of research on robust IR being proposed, we believe it is the opportune moment to consolidate the current status, glean insights from existing methodologies, and lay the groundwork for future development. We view the robustness of IR to be a multifaceted concept, emphasizing its necessity against adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and performance variance. With a focus on adversarial and OOD robustness, we dissect robustness solutions for dense retrieval models (DRMs) and neural ranking models (NRMs), respectively, recognizing them as pivotal components of the neural IR pipeline. We provide an in-depth discussion of existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, shedding light on challenges and future directions in the era of large language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on the robustness of neural IR models, and we will also be giving our first tutorial presentation at SIGIR 2024 \url{https://sigir2024-robust-information-retrieval.github.io}. Along with the organization of existing work, we introduce a Benchmark for robust IR (BestIR), a heterogeneous evaluation benchmark for robust neural information retrieval, which is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/BestIR}. We hope that this study provides useful clues for future research on the robustness of IR models and helps to develop trustworthy search engines \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/Awesome-Robustness-in-Information-Retrieval}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amey Agrawal, Anmol Agarwal, Nitin Kedia, Jayashree Mohan, Souvik Kundu, Nipun Kwatra, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) in production can incur substantial costs, which has prompted recent advances in inference system optimizations. Today, these systems are evaluated against conventional latency and throughput metrics (eg. TTFT, TBT, Normalised Latency and TPOT). However, these metrics fail to fully capture the nuances of LLM inference, leading to an incomplete assessment of user-facing performance crucial for real-time applications such as chat and translation. In this paper, we first identify the pitfalls of current performance metrics in evaluating LLM inference systems. We then propose Metron, a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that includes fluidity-index -- a novel metric designed to reflect the intricacies of the LLM inference process and its impact on real-time user experience. Finally, we evaluate various existing open-source platforms and model-as-a-service offerings using Metron, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Metron is available at https://github.com/project-metron/metron.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhang, Wenjie Ai, Kevin Wells, David Rosewarne, Thanh-Toan Do, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of Human-AI Collaboration in Classification (HAI-CC), integrating users and AI predictions becomes challenging due to the complex decision-making process. This process has three options: 1) AI autonomously classifies, 2) learning to complement, where AI collaborates with users, and 3) learning to defer, where AI defers to users. Despite their interconnected nature, these options have been studied in isolation rather than as components of a unified system. In this paper, we address this weakness with the novel HAI-CC methodology, called Learning to Complement and to Defer to Multiple Users (LECODU). LECODU not only combines learning to complement and learning to defer strategies, but it also incorporates an estimation of the optimal number of users to engage in the decision process. The training of LECODU maximises classification accuracy and minimises collaboration costs associated with user involvement. Comprehensive evaluations across real-world and synthesized datasets demonstrate LECODU's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art HAI-CC methods. Remarkably, even when relying on unreliable users with high rates of label noise, LECODU exhibits significant improvement over both human decision-makers alone and AI alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapha\"el Tinarrage, Henrique Ennes, Lucas E. Resck, Lucas T. Gomes, Jean R. Ponciano, Jorge Poco</p>
<p>Abstract: Binding precedents (S\'umulas Vinculantes) constitute a juridical instrument unique to the Brazilian legal system and whose objectives include the protection of the Federal Supreme Court against repetitive demands. Studies of the effectiveness of these instruments in decreasing the Court's exposure to similar cases, however, indicate that they tend to fail in such a direction, with some of the binding precedents seemingly creating new demands. We empirically assess the legal impact of five binding precedents, 11, 14, 17, 26 and 37, at the highest court level through their effects on the legal subjects they address. This analysis is only possible through the comparison of the Court's ruling about the precedents' themes before they are created, which means that these decisions should be detected through techniques of Similar Case Retrieval. The contributions of this article are therefore twofold: on the mathematical side, we compare the uses of different methods of Natural Language Processing -- TF-IDF, LSTM, BERT, and regex -- for Similar Case Retrieval, whereas on the legal side, we contrast the inefficiency of these binding precedents with a set of hypotheses that may justify their repeated usage. We observe that the deep learning models performed significantly worse in the specific Similar Case Retrieval task and that the reasons for binding precedents to fail in responding to repetitive demand are heterogeneous and case-dependent, making it impossible to single out a specific cause.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongseok Hyun, Su Ho Han, Hyolim Kang, Joon-Young Lee, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The vocabulary size in temporal action localization (TAL) is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To address this, recent works incorporate powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to perform open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, unlike VLMs trained on extensive image/video-text pairs, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on small, fully labeled TAL datasets for training an action localizer. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our self-training approach consists of two stages. First, a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset and used to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos. Second, the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is combined with the human-labeled dataset to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we highlighted issues with existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and proposed a new evaluation protocol. Code is released at https://github.com/HYUNJS/STOV-TAL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Mandelli, Edoardo Daniele Cannas, Paolo Bestagini, Stefano Tebaldini, Stefano Tubaro</p>
<p>Abstract: The vast accessibility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images through online portals has propelled the research across various fields. This widespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data susceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the images for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets. Vulnerability is further emphasized by the fact that most SAR products, despite their original complex nature, are often released as amplitude-only information, allowing even inexperienced attackers to edit and easily alter the pixel content. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the forensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing detectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images. Nonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can exploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation within a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a counter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the attacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR system that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker can obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was legitimately produced by the system. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed counter-forensic approach across diverse scenarios, examining various manipulation operations. The obtained results indicate that our devised attack successfully eliminates traces of manipulation, deceiving even the most advanced forensic detectors.</p>

It combines the use of prototypical networks, known for few-shot segmentation, with SAM - a natural image foundation model. The method proposed creates an initial coarse segmentation mask using the ALPnet prototypical network, augmented with a DINOv2 encoder. Following the extraction of an initial mask, prompts are extracted, such as points and bounding boxes, which are then input into the Segment Anything Model (SAM). State-of-the-art results are shown on several medical image datasets and demonstrate automated segmentation capabilities using a single image example (one shot) with no need for fine-tuning of the foundation model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Catherine Tony, Nicol\'as E. D\'iaz Ferreyra, Markus Mutas, Salem Dhiff, Riccardo Scandariato</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions. However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. METHOD: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. RESULTS: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yung-Sung Chuang, Linlu Qiu, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ranjay Krishna, Yoon Kim, James Glass</p>
<p>Abstract: When asked to summarize articles or answer questions given a passage, large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate details and respond with unsubstantiated answers that are inaccurate with respect to the input context. This paper describes a simple approach for detecting such contextual hallucinations. We hypothesize that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to information in the provided context versus its own generations. Based on this intuition, we propose a simple hallucination detection model whose input features are given by the ratio of attention weights on the context versus newly generated tokens (for each attention head). We find that a linear classifier based on these lookback ratio features is as effective as a richer detector that utilizes the entire hidden states of an LLM or a text-based entailment model. The lookback ratio-based detector -- Lookback Lens -- is found to transfer across tasks and even models, allowing a detector that is trained on a 7B model to be applied (without retraining) to a larger 13B model. We further apply this detector to mitigate contextual hallucinations, and find that a simple classifier-guided decoding approach is able to reduce the amount of hallucination, for example by 9.6% in the XSum summarization task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaozhe Hao, Kai Han, Zhengyao Lv, Shihao Zhao, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: While personalized text-to-image generation has enabled the learning of a single concept from multiple images, a more practical yet challenging scenario involves learning multiple concepts within a single image. However, existing works tackling this scenario heavily rely on extensive human annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel task named Unsupervised Concept Extraction (UCE) that considers an unsupervised setting without any human knowledge of the concepts. Given an image that contains multiple concepts, the task aims to extract and recreate individual concepts solely relying on the existing knowledge from pretrained diffusion models. To achieve this, we present ConceptExpress that tackles UCE by unleashing the inherent capabilities of pretrained diffusion models in two aspects. Specifically, a concept localization approach automatically locates and disentangles salient concepts by leveraging spatial correspondence from diffusion self-attention; and based on the lookup association between a concept and a conceptual token, a concept-wise optimization process learns discriminative tokens that represent each individual concept. Finally, we establish an evaluation protocol tailored for the UCE task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptExpress is a promising solution to the UCE task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander David Goldie, Chris Lu, Matthew Thomas Jackson, Shimon Whiteson, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) holds great potential for decision making in the real world, it suffers from a number of unique difficulties which often need specific consideration. In particular: it is highly non-stationary; suffers from high degrees of plasticity loss; and requires exploration to prevent premature convergence to local optima and maximize return. In this paper, we consider whether learned optimization can help overcome these problems. Our method, Learned Optimization for Plasticity, Exploration and Non-stationarity (OPEN), meta-learns an update rule whose input features and output structure are informed by previously proposed solutions to these difficulties. We show that our parameterization is flexible enough to enable meta-learning in diverse learning contexts, including the ability to use stochasticity for exploration. Our experiments demonstrate that when meta-trained on single and small sets of environments, OPEN outperforms or equals traditionally used optimizers. Furthermore, OPEN shows strong generalization across a distribution of environments and a range of agent architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mara Levy, Abhinav Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to represent three dimensional (3D) human pose given a two dimensional (2D) image of a person, is a challenging problem. In order to make the problem less ambiguous it has become common practice to estimate 3D pose in the camera coordinate space. However, this makes the task of comparing two 3D poses difficult. In this paper, we address this challenge by separating the problem of estimating 3D pose from 2D images into two steps. We use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to find an embedding that represents 3D poses in canonical coordinate space. We refer to this embedding as variational view-invariant pose embedding V-VIPE. Using V-VIPE we can encode 2D and 3D poses and use the embedding for downstream tasks, like retrieval and classification. We can estimate 3D poses from these embeddings using the decoder as well as generate unseen 3D poses. The variability of our encoding allows it to generalize well to unseen camera views when mapping from 2D space. To the best of our knowledge, V-VIPE is the only representation to offer this diversity of applications. Code and more information can be found at https://v-vipe.github.io/.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a Fully BInarized Large Language Model (FBI-LLM), demonstrating for the first time how to train a large-scale binary language model from scratch (not the partial binary or ternary LLM like BitNet b1.58) to match the performance of its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) in transformer-based LLMs. It achieves this by employing an autoregressive distillation (AD) loss with maintaining equivalent model dimensions (130M, 1.3B, 7B) and training data volume as regular LLM pretraining, while delivering competitive results in terms of perplexity and task-specific effectiveness. Intriguingly, by analyzing the training trajectory, we find that the pretrained weight is not necessary for training binarized LLMs from scratch.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Cui, Wentao Zhang, Jing Tang, Xudong Tong, Zhenwei Zhang,  Amie, Jing Wen, Rongsheng Wang, Pengfei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The pervasive deployment of Large Language Models-LLMs in various sectors often neglects the nuanced requirements of individuals and small organizations, who benefit more from models precisely tailored to their specific business contexts rather than those with broadly superior general capabilities. This work introduces \textbf{AnyTaskTune}, a novel fine-tuning methodology coined as \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune}, specifically developed to elevate model performance on a diverse array of domain-specific tasks. This method involves a meticulous process to identify and define targeted sub-tasks within a domain, followed by the creation of specialized enhancement datasets for fine-tuning, thereby optimizing task-specific model performance. We conducted comprehensive fine-tuning experiments not only in the legal domain for tasks such as keyword extraction and sentence prediction but across over twenty different sub-tasks derived from the domains of finance, healthcare, law, psychology, consumer services, and human resources. To substantiate our approach and facilitate community engagement, we will open-source these bilingual task datasets. Our findings demonstrate that models fine-tuned using the \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune} methodology not only achieve superior performance on these specific tasks but also significantly outperform models with higher general capabilities in their respective domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marlene D. Berke, Zhangir Azerbayev, Mario Belledonne, Zenna Tavares, Julian Jara-Ettinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have the capacity to question what we see and to recognize when our vision is unreliable (e.g., when we realize that we are experiencing a visual illusion). Inspired by this capacity, we present MetaCOG: a hierarchical probabilistic model that can be attached to a neural object detector to monitor its outputs and determine their reliability. MetaCOG achieves this by learning a probabilistic model of the object detector's performance via Bayesian inference -- i.e., a meta-cognitive representation of the network's propensity to hallucinate or miss different object categories. Given a set of video frames processed by an object detector, MetaCOG performs joint inference over the underlying 3D scene and the detector's performance, grounding inference on a basic assumption of object permanence. Paired with three neural object detectors, we show that MetaCOG accurately recovers each detector's performance parameters and improves the overall system's accuracy. We additionally show that MetaCOG is robust to varying levels of error in object detector outputs, showing proof-of-concept for a novel approach to the problem of detecting and correcting errors in vision systems when ground-truth is not available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Chen, Samuel Yang-Zhao, John Lloyd, Kee Siong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces factored conditional filters, new filtering algorithms for simultaneously tracking states and estimating parameters in high-dimensional state spaces. The conditional nature of the algorithms is used to estimate parameters and the factored nature is used to decompose the state space into low-dimensional subspaces in such a way that filtering on these subspaces gives distributions whose product is a good approximation to the distribution on the entire state space. The conditions for successful application of the algorithms are that observations be available at the subspace level and that the transition model can be factored into local transition models that are approximately confined to the subspaces; these conditions are widely satisfied in computer science, engineering, and geophysical filtering applications. We give experimental results on tracking epidemics and estimating parameters in large contact networks that show the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is currently at the forefront of the digital transformation of our society. By enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with the traffic environment using cellular networks, we redefine transportation, improving road safety and transportation services, increasing efficiency of vehicular traffic flows, and reducing environmental impact. To effectively facilitate the provisioning of Cellular Vehicular-to-Network (C-V2N) services, we tackle the interdependent problems of service task placement and scaling of edge resources. Specifically, we formulate the joint problem and prove that it is not computationally tractable. To address its complexity we introduce a Deep Hybrid Policy Gradient (DHPG), a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for hybrid action spaces.The performance of DHPG is evaluated against several state-of-the-art (SoA) solutions through simulations employing a real-world C-V2N traffic dataset. The results demonstrate that DHPG outperforms SoA solutions in maintaining C-V2N service latency below the preset delay threshold, while simultaneously optimizing the utilization of computing resources. Finally, time complexity analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed approach can support real-time C-V2N services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milapji Singh Gill, Tom Westermann, Marvin Schieseck, Alexander Fay</p>
<p>Abstract: In the age of Industry 4.0 and Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) vast amounts of potentially valuable data are being generated. Methods from Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) have proven to be promising in extracting complex and hidden patterns from the data collected. The knowledge obtained can in turn be used to improve tasks like diagnostics or maintenance planning. However, such data-driven projects, usually performed with the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), often fail due to the disproportionate amount of time needed for understanding and preparing the data. The application of domain-specific ontologies has demonstrated its advantageousness in a wide variety of Industry 4.0 application scenarios regarding the aforementioned challenges. However, workflows and artifacts from ontology design for CPPSs have not yet been systematically integrated into the CRISP-DM. Accordingly, this contribution intends to present an integrated approach so that data scientists are able to more quickly and reliably gain insights into the CPPS. The result is exemplarily applied to an anomaly detection use case.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive pro-gress on several open-world tasks. Recently, using LLMs to build embodied agents has been a hotspot. This paper proposes STEVE, a comprehensive and visionary embodied agent in the Minecraft virtual environment. STEVE comprises three key components: vision perception, language instruction, and code action. Vision perception involves interpreting visual information in the environment, which is then integrated into the LLMs component with agent state and task instruction. Language instruction is responsible for iterative reasoning and decomposing complex tasks into manageable guidelines. Code action generates executable skill actions based on retrieval in skill database, enabling the agent to interact effectively within the Minecraft environment. We also collect STEVE-21K dataset, which includes 600+ vision-environment pairs, 20K knowledge question-answering pairs, and 200+ skill-code pairs. We conduct continuous block search, knowledge question and answering, and tech tree mastery to evaluate the performance. Extensive experiments show that STEVE achieves at most 1.5x faster unlocking key tech trees and 2.5x quicker in block search tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lance Ying, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lionel Wong, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua Tenenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the fact that beliefs are mental states that cannot be directly observed, humans talk about each others' beliefs on a regular basis, often using rich compositional language to describe what others think and know. What explains this capacity to interpret the hidden epistemic content of other minds? In this paper, we take a step towards an answer by grounding the semantics of belief statements in a Bayesian theory-of-mind: By modeling how humans jointly infer coherent sets of goals, beliefs, and plans that explain an agent's actions, then evaluating statements about the agent's beliefs against these inferences via epistemic logic, our framework provides a conceptual role semantics for belief, explaining the gradedness and compositionality of human belief attributions, as well as their intimate connection with goals and plans. We evaluate this framework by studying how humans attribute goals and beliefs while watching an agent solve a doors-and-keys gridworld puzzle that requires instrumental reasoning about hidden objects. In contrast to pure logical deduction, non-mentalizing baselines, and mentalizing that ignores the role of instrumental plans, our model provides a much better fit to human goal and belief attributions, demonstrating the importance of theory-of-mind for a semantics of belief.</p>

In this paper, we report on a large-scale experiment with discovering strategies for the Vampire prover, targeting the FOF fragment of the TPTP library and constructing a schedule for it, based on the ideas of Andrei Voronkov's system Spider. We examine the process from various angles, discuss the difficulty (or ease) of obtaining a strong Vampire schedule for the CASC competition, and establish how well a schedule can be expected to generalize to unseen problems and what factors influence this property.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ciaran Regan, Alexandre Gournail, Mizuki Oka</p>
<p>Abstract: To improve the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), several multi-agent approaches have been introduced. While these methods enhance performance, the application of collective intelligence-based approaches to complex network structures and the dynamics of agent interactions remain underexplored. This work extends the concept of multi-agent debate to more general network topologies, measuring the question-answering accuracy, influence, consensus, and the effects of bias on the collective. The results show that random networks perform similarly to fully connected networks despite using significantly fewer tokens. Furthermore, a strong consensus among agents correlates with correct answers, whereas divided responses typically indicate incorrect answers. Analysing the influence of the agents reveals a balance between self-reflection and interconnectedness; self-reflection aids when local interactions are incorrect, and local interactions aid when the agent itself is incorrect. Additionally, bias plays a strong role in system performance with correctly biased hub nodes boosting performance. These insights suggest that using random networks or scale-free networks with knowledgeable agents placed in central positions can enhance the overall question-answering performance of multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Meo, Ksenia Sycheva, Anirudh Goyal, Justin Dauwels</p>
<p>Abstract: It is a common practice in natural language processing to pre-train a single model on a general domain and then fine-tune it for downstream tasks. However, when it comes to Large Language Models, fine-tuning the entire model can be computationally expensive, resulting in very intensive energy consumption. As a result, several Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches were recently proposed. One of the most popular approaches is low-rank adaptation (LoRA), where the key insight is decomposing the update weights of the pre-trained model into two low-rank matrices. However, the proposed approaches either use the same rank value across all different weight matrices, which has been shown to be a sub-optimal choice, or do not use any quantization technique, one of the most important factors when it comes to a model's energy consumption. In this work, we propose Bayesian-LoRA which approaches low-rank adaptation and quantization from a Bayesian perspective by employing a prior distribution on both quantization levels and rank values. As a result, B-LoRA is able to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a specific downstream task, finding the optimal rank values and quantization levels for every low-rank matrix. We validate the proposed model by fine-tuning a pre-trained DeBERTaV3 on the GLUE benchmark. Moreover, we compare it to relevant baselines and present both qualitative and quantitative results, showing how the proposed approach is able to learn optimal-rank quantized matrices. B-LoRA performs on par with or better than the baselines while reducing the total number of bit operations by roughly 70% compared to the baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah K. Bako, Arshnoor Bhutani, Xinyi Liu, Kwesi A. Cobbina, Zhicheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically generating data visualizations in response to human utterances on datasets necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the data utterance, including implicit and explicit references to data attributes, visualization tasks, and necessary data preparation steps. Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) for data visualization have explored ways to infer such information, yet challenges persist due to inherent uncertainty in human speech. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an avenue to address these challenges, but their ability to extract the relevant semantic information remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four publicly available LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, Llama3, and Mixtral), investigating their ability to comprehend utterances even in the presence of uncertainty and identify the relevant data context and visual tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs are sensitive to uncertainties in utterances. Despite this sensitivity, they are able to extract the relevant data context. However, LLMs struggle with inferring visualization tasks. Based on these results, we highlight future research directions on using LLMs for visualization generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper suggests a statistical framework for describing the relations between the physical and conceptual entities of a brain-like model. Features and concept instances are put into context, where the paper suggests that features may be the electrical wiring, although chemical connections are also possible. With this idea, the actual length of the connection is important, because it is related to firing rates and neuron synchronization, but the signal type is less important. The paper then suggests that concepts are neuron groups that link feature sets and concept instances are determined by chemical signals from those groups. Therefore, features become the static horizontal framework of the neural system and concepts are vertically interconnected combinations of these. With regards to functionality, the neuron is then considered to be functional and the more horizontal memory structures can be glial. This would also suggest that features can be distributed entities and not concentrated to a single area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Klamkin, Mathieu Tanneau, Terrence W. K. Mak, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers optimization proxies for Optimal Power Flow (OPF), i.e., machine-learning models that approximate the input/output relationship of OPF. Recent work has focused on showing that such proxies can be of high fidelity. However, their training requires significant data, each instance necessitating the (offline) solving of an OPF. To meet the requirements of market-clearing applications, this paper proposes Bucketized Active Sampling (BAS), a novel active learning framework that aims at training the best possible OPF proxy within a time limit. BAS partitions the input domain into buckets and uses an acquisition function to determine where to sample next. By applying the same partitioning to the validation set, BAS leverages labeled validation samples in the selection of unlabeled samples. BAS also relies on an adaptive learning rate that increases and decreases over time. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of BAS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vittoria Dentella, Fritz Guenther, Elliot Murphy, Gary Marcus, Evelina Leivada</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are recruited in applications that span from clinical assistance and legal support to question answering and education. Their success in specialized tasks has led to the claim that they possess human-like linguistic capabilities related to compositional understanding and reasoning. Yet, reverse-engineering is bound by Moravec's Paradox, according to which easy skills are hard. We systematically assess 7 state-of-the-art models on a novel benchmark. Models answered a series of comprehension questions, each prompted multiple times in two settings, permitting one-word or open-length replies. Each question targets a short text featuring high-frequency linguistic constructions. To establish a baseline for achieving human-like performance, we tested 400 humans on the same prompts. Based on a dataset of n=26,680 datapoints, we discovered that LLMs perform at chance accuracy and waver considerably in their answers. Quantitatively, the tested models are outperformed by humans, and qualitatively their answers showcase distinctly non-human errors in language understanding. We interpret this evidence as suggesting that, despite their usefulness in various tasks, current AI models fall short of understanding language in a way that matches humans, and we argue that this may be due to their lack of a compositional operator for regulating grammatical and semantic information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thilo Hagendorff</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently at the forefront of intertwining AI systems with human communication and everyday life. Due to rapid technological advances and their extreme versatility, LLMs nowadays have millions of users and are at the cusp of being the main go-to technology for information retrieval, content generation, problem-solving, etc. Therefore, it is of great importance to thoroughly assess and scrutinize their capabilities. Due to increasingly complex and novel behavioral patterns in current LLMs, this can be done by treating them as participants in psychology experiments that were originally designed to test humans. For this purpose, the paper introduces a new field of research called "machine psychology". The paper outlines how different subfields of psychology can inform behavioral tests for LLMs. It defines methodological standards for machine psychology research, especially by focusing on policies for prompt designs. Additionally, it describes how behavioral patterns discovered in LLMs are to be interpreted. In sum, machine psychology aims to discover emergent abilities in LLMs that cannot be detected by most traditional natural language processing benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanyoung Chung, Jaejun Lee, Joyce Jiyoung Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: A hyper-relational knowledge graph has been recently studied where a triplet is associated with a set of qualifiers; a qualifier is composed of a relation and an entity, providing auxiliary information for a triplet. While existing hyper-relational knowledge graph embedding methods assume that the entities are discrete objects, some information should be represented using numeric values, e.g., (J.R.R., was born in, 1892). Also, a triplet (J.R.R., educated at, Oxford Univ.) can be associated with a qualifier such as (start time, 1911). In this paper, we propose a unified framework named HyNT that learns representations of a hyper-relational knowledge graph containing numeric literals in either triplets or qualifiers. We define a context transformer and a prediction transformer to learn the representations based not only on the correlations between a triplet and its qualifiers but also on the numeric information. By learning compact representations of triplets and qualifiers and feeding them into the transformers, we reduce the computation cost of using transformers. Using HyNT, we can predict missing numeric values in addition to missing entities or relations in a hyper-relational knowledge graph. Experimental results show that HyNT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Ramos, Hailie Mitchell, In\^es Lynce, Vasco Manquinho, Ruben Martins, Claire Le Goues</p>
<p>Abstract: Software developers often struggle to update APIs, leading to manual, time-consuming, and error-prone processes. We introduce MELT, a new approach that generates lightweight API migration rules directly from pull requests in popular library repositories. Our key insight is that pull requests merged into open-source libraries are a rich source of information sufficient to mine API migration rules. By leveraging code examples mined from the library source and automatically generated code examples based on the pull requests, we infer transformation rules in \comby, a language for structural code search and replace. Since inferred rules from single code examples may be too specific, we propose a generalization procedure to make the rules more applicable to client projects. MELT rules are syntax-driven, interpretable, and easily adaptable. Moreover, unlike previous work, our approach enables rule inference to seamlessly integrate into the library workflow, removing the need to wait for client code migrations. We evaluated MELT on pull requests from four popular libraries, successfully mining 461 migration rules from code examples in pull requests and 114 rules from auto-generated code examples. Our generalization procedure increases the number of matches for mined rules by 9x. We applied these rules to client projects and ran their tests, which led to an overall decrease in the number of warnings and fixing some test cases demonstrating MELT's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Helan Hu, Shuzheng Si, Haozhe Zhao, Shuang Zeng, Kaikai An, Zefan Cai, Baobao Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER) is widely used in real-world scenarios. It can effectively alleviate the burden of annotation by matching entities in existing knowledge bases with snippets in the text but suffer from the label noise. Recent works attempt to adopt the teacher-student framework to gradually refine the training labels and improve the overall robustness. However, these teacher-student methods achieve limited performance because the poor calibration of the teacher network produces incorrectly pseudo-labeled samples, leading to error propagation. Therefore, we propose: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Learning that leverages the prediction uncertainty to reduce the number of incorrect pseudo labels in the self-training stage; (2) Student-Student Collaborative Learning that allows the transfer of reliable labels between two student networks instead of indiscriminately relying on all pseudo labels from its teacher, and further enables a full exploration of mislabeled samples rather than simply filtering unreliable pseudo-labeled samples. We evaluate our proposed method on five DS-NER datasets, demonstrating that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art DS-NER methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinheng Li, Shaofei Wang, Han Ding, Hang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for artificial intelligence applications in finance. In this paper, we provide a practical survey focused on two key aspects of utilizing LLMs for financial tasks: existing solutions and guidance for adoption.
  First, we review current approaches employing LLMs in finance, including leveraging pretrained models via zero-shot or few-shot learning, fine-tuning on domain-specific data, and training custom LLMs from scratch. We summarize key models and evaluate their performance improvements on financial natural language processing tasks.
  Second, we propose a decision framework to guide financial professionals in selecting the appropriate LLM solution based on their use case constraints around data, compute, and performance needs. The framework provides a pathway from lightweight experimentation to heavy investment in customized LLMs.
  Lastly, we discuss limitations and challenges around leveraging LLMs in financial applications. Overall, this survey aims to synthesize the state-of-the-art and provide a roadmap for responsibly applying LLMs to advance financial AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Mahmudur Rahman, Sajid Islam, Showren Chowdhury, Sadia Jahan Zeba, Debajyoti Karmaker</p>
<p>Abstract: This study delves into the flight behaviors of Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to gain insights into their flight trajectories and movements. Using 3D reconstruction from stereo video camera recordings, we closely examine the velocity and acceleration patterns during three flight motion takeoff, flying and landing. The findings not only contribute to our understanding of bird behaviors but also hold significant implications for the advancement of algorithms in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The research aims to bridge the gap between biological principles observed in birds and the application of these insights in developing more efficient and autonomous UAVs. In the context of the increasing use of drones, this study focuses on the biologically inspired principles drawn from bird behaviors, particularly during takeoff, flying and landing flight, to enhance UAV capabilities. The dataset created for this research sheds light on Budgerigars' takeoff, flying, and landing techniques, emphasizing their ability to control speed across different situations and surfaces. The study underscores the potential of incorporating these principles into UAV algorithms, addressing challenges related to short-range navigation, takeoff, flying, and landing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Limoyo, Abhisek Konar, Trevor Ablett, Jonathan Kelly, Francois R. Hogan, Gregory Dudek</p>
<p>Abstract: We present placing via picking (PvP), a method to autonomously collect real-world demonstrations for a family of placing tasks in which objects must be manipulated to specific, contact-constrained locations. With PvP, we approach the collection of robotic object placement demonstrations by reversing the grasping process and exploiting the inherent symmetry of the pick and place problems. Specifically, we obtain placing demonstrations from a set of grasp sequences of objects initially located at their target placement locations. Our system can collect hundreds of demonstrations in contact-constrained environments without human intervention using two modules: compliant control for grasping and tactile regrasping. We train a policy directly from visual observations through behavioural cloning, using the autonomously-collected demonstrations. By doing so, the policy can generalize to object placement scenarios outside of the training environment without privileged information (e.g., placing a plate picked up from a table). We validate our approach in home robot scenarios that include dishwasher loading and table setting. Our approach yields robotic placing policies that outperform policies trained with kinesthetic teaching, both in terms of success rate and data efficiency, while requiring no human supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Shi, Tu Ouyang, An Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, are currently an integral part of various applications, from healthcare to finance. However, using sensitive data to train these models raises concerns about privacy and security. One method that has emerged to verify if the trained models are privacy-preserving is Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which allows adversaries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's training dataset. While a series of MIAs have been proposed in the literature, only a few can achieve high True Positive Rates (TPR) in the low False Positive Rate (FPR) region (0.01%~1%). This is a crucial factor to consider for an MIA to be practically useful in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a novel approach to MIA that is aimed at significantly improving TPR at low FPRs. Our method, named learning-based difficulty calibration for MIA(LDC-MIA), characterizes data records by their hardness levels using a neural network classifier to determine membership. The experiment results show that LDC-MIA can improve TPR at low FPR by up to 4x compared to the other difficulty calibration based MIAs. It also has the highest Area Under ROC curve (AUC) across all datasets. Our method's cost is comparable with most of the existing MIAs, but is orders of magnitude more efficient than one of the state-of-the-art methods, LiRA, while achieving similar performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the learning dynamics of neural networks by analyzing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of their weights throughout training. Our investigation reveals that an orthogonal basis within each multidimensional weight's SVD representation stabilizes during training. Building upon this, we introduce Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR) training, a novel training method exploiting the intrinsic orthogonality of neural networks. OIALR seamlessly integrates into existing training workflows with minimal accuracy loss, as demonstrated by benchmarking on various datasets and well-established network architectures. With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, OIALR can surpass conventional training setups, including those of state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhou, Bo Li, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Qu, Samuel Horvath</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies suggest that with sufficiently wide models, most SGD solutions can, up to permutation, converge into the same basin. This phenomenon, known as the model re-basin regime, has significant implications for model averaging by ensuring the linear mode connectivity. However, current re-basin strategies are ineffective in many scenarios due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanisms. Addressing this gap, this paper provides novel insights into understanding and improving the standard practice. Firstly, we decompose re-normalization into rescaling and reshift, uncovering that rescaling plays a crucial role in re-normalization while re-basin performance is sensitive to shifts in model activation. The finding calls for a more nuanced handling of the activation shift. Secondly, we identify that the merged model suffers from the issue of activation collapse and magnitude collapse. Varying the learning rate, weight decay, and initialization method can mitigate the issues and improve model performance. Lastly, we propose a new perspective to unify the re-basin and pruning, under which a lightweight yet effective post-pruning technique is derived, which can significantly improve the model performance after pruning. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/XingyuQu/rethink-re-basin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Fan, Xin Jiang, Xiang Li, Xuying Meng, Peng Han, Shuo Shang, Aixin Sun, Yequan Wang, Zhongyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the large number of parameters, the inference phase of Large Language Models (LLMs) is resource-intensive. However, not all requests posed to LLMs are equally difficult to handle. Through analysis, we show that for some tasks, LLMs can achieve results comparable to the final output at some intermediate layers. That is, not all layers of LLMs are necessary during inference. If we can predict at which layer the inferred results match the final results (produced by evaluating all layers), we could significantly reduce the inference cost. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named AdaInfer to adaptively terminate the inference process for an input instance. AdaInfer relies on easily obtainable statistical features and classic classifiers like SVM. Experiments on well-known LLMs like the Llama2 series and OPT, show that AdaInfer can achieve an average of 17.8% pruning ratio, and up to 43% on sentiment tasks, with nearly no performance drop (<1%). Because AdaInfer does not alter LLM parameters, the LLMs incorporated with AdaInfer maintain generalizability across tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Krogmann, Pascal Lenzner, Alexander Skopalik, Marc Uetz, Marnix C. Vos</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider competitive facility location as a two-stage multi-agent system with two types of clients. For a given host graph with weighted clients on the vertices, first facility agents strategically select vertices for opening their facilities. Then, the clients strategically select which of the opened facilities in their neighborhood to patronize. Facilities want to attract as much client weight as possible, clients want to minimize congestion on the chosen facility.
  All recently studied versions of this model assume that clients can split their weight strategically. We consider clients with unsplittable weights but allow mixed strategies. So clients may randomize over which facility to patronize. Besides modeling a natural client behavior, this subtle change yields drastic changes, e.g., for a given facility placement, qualitatively different client equilibria are possible.
  As our main result, we show that pure subgame perfect equilibria always exist if all client weights are identical. For this, we use a novel potential function argument, employing a hierarchical classification of the clients and sophisticated rounding in each step. In contrast, for non-identical clients, we show that deciding the existence of even approximately stable states is computationally intractable. On the positive side, we give a tight bound of $2$ on the price of anarchy which implies high social welfare of equilibria, if they exist.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaishen Yuan, Zitong Yu, Xin Liu, Weicheng Xie, Huanjing Yue, Jingyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Action Units (AU) is a vital concept in the realm of affective computing, and AU detection has always been a hot research topic. Existing methods suffer from overfitting issues due to the utilization of a large number of learnable parameters on scarce AU-annotated datasets or heavy reliance on substantial additional relevant data. Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) provides a promising paradigm to address these challenges, whereas its existing methods lack design for AU characteristics. Therefore, we innovatively investigate PETL paradigm to AU detection, introducing AUFormer and proposing a novel Mixture-of-Knowledge Expert (MoKE) collaboration mechanism. An individual MoKE specific to a certain AU with minimal learnable parameters first integrates personalized multi-scale and correlation knowledge. Then the MoKE collaborates with other MoKEs in the expert group to obtain aggregated information and inject it into the frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) to achieve parameter-efficient AU detection. Additionally, we design a Margin-truncated Difficulty-aware Weighted Asymmetric Loss (MDWA-Loss), which can encourage the model to focus more on activated AUs, differentiate the difficulty of unactivated AUs, and discard potential mislabeled samples. Extensive experiments from various perspectives, including within-domain, cross-domain, data efficiency, and micro-expression domain, demonstrate AUFormer's state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization abilities without relying on additional relevant data. The code for AUFormer is available at https://github.com/yuankaishen2001/AUFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoying Zhang, Jean-Francois Ton, Wei Shen, Hongning Wang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Adversarial Policy Optimization (AdvPO), a novel solution to the pervasive issue of reward over-optimization in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for Large Language Models (LLMs). Over-optimization occurs when a reward model serves as an imperfect proxy for human preference, and RL-driven policy optimization erroneously exploits reward inaccuracies. In this paper, we begin by introducing a lightweight way to quantify uncertainties in rewards, relying solely on the last layer embeddings of the reward model, without the need for computationally expensive reward ensembles. AdvPO then addresses a distributionally robust optimization problem centred around the confidence interval of the reward model's predictions for policy improvement. Through comprehensive experiments on the Anthropic HH and TL;DR summarization datasets, we illustrate the efficacy of AdvPO in mitigating the overoptimization issue, consequently resulting in enhanced performance as evaluated through human-assisted evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennart Wachowiak, Andrew Coles, Oya Celiktutan, Gerard Canal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in robotics, especially for high-level action planning. Meanwhile, many robotics applications involve human supervisors or collaborators. Hence, it is crucial for LLMs to generate socially acceptable actions that align with people's preferences and values. In this work, we test whether LLMs capture people's intuitions about behavior judgments and communication preferences in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. For evaluation, we reproduce three HRI user studies, comparing the output of LLMs with that of real participants. We find that GPT-4 strongly outperforms other models, generating answers that correlate strongly with users' answers in two studies $\unicode{x2014}$ the first study dealing with selecting the most appropriate communicative act for a robot in various situations ($r_s$ = 0.82), and the second with judging the desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness of behavior ($r_s$ = 0.83). However, for the last study, testing whether people judge the behavior of robots and humans differently, no model achieves strong correlations. Moreover, we show that vision models fail to capture the essence of video stimuli and that LLMs tend to rate different communicative acts and behavior desirability higher than people.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07362">Challenging Forgets: Unveiling the Worst-Case Forget Sets in Machine Unlearning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Alfred Hero, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The trustworthy machine learning (ML) community is increasingly recognizing the crucial need for models capable of selectively 'unlearning' data points after training. This leads to the problem of machine unlearning (MU), aiming to eliminate the influence of chosen data points on model performance, while still maintaining the model's utility post-unlearning. Despite various MU methods for data influence erasure, evaluations have largely focused on random data forgetting, ignoring the vital inquiry into which subset should be chosen to truly gauge the authenticity of unlearning performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new evaluative angle for MU from an adversarial viewpoint. We propose identifying the data subset that presents the most significant challenge for influence erasure, i.e., pinpointing the worst-case forget set. Utilizing a bi-level optimization principle, we amplify unlearning challenges at the upper optimization level to emulate worst-case scenarios, while simultaneously engaging in standard training and unlearning at the lower level, achieving a balance between data influence erasure and model utility. Our proposal offers a worst-case evaluation of MU's resilience and effectiveness. Through extensive experiments across different datasets (including CIFAR-10, 100, CelebA, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet) and models (including both image classifiers and generative models), we expose critical pros and cons in existing (approximate) unlearning strategies. Our results illuminate the complex challenges of MU in practice, guiding the future development of more accurate and robust unlearning algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Zhang, Xingtong Ge, Tongda Xu, Dailan He, Yan Wang, Hongwei Qin, Guo Lu, Jing Geng, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 2000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.

Furthermore, we explore various experiment settings, including different types of text representations, text encoder fine-tuning, and introducing speech data to alleviate data scarcity, aiming to facilitate further research.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces HuLP, a Human-in-the-Loop for Prognosis model designed to enhance the reliability and interpretability of prognostic models in clinical contexts, especially when faced with the complexities of missing covariates and outcomes. HuLP offers an innovative approach that enables human expert intervention, empowering clinicians to interact with and correct models' predictions, thus fostering collaboration between humans and AI models to produce more accurate prognosis. Additionally, HuLP addresses the challenges of missing data by utilizing neural networks and providing a tailored methodology that effectively handles missing data. Traditional methods often struggle to capture the nuanced variations within patient populations, leading to compromised prognostic predictions. HuLP imputes missing covariates based on imaging features, aligning more closely with clinician workflows and enhancing reliability. We conduct our experiments on two real-world, publicly available medical datasets to demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of HuLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we interact with cyber technologies. In this paper, we study the possibility of connecting LLM with wireless sensor networks (WSN). A successful design will not only extend LLM's knowledge landscape to the physical world but also revolutionize human interaction with WSN. To the end, we present ChatTracer, an LLM-powered real-time Bluetooth device tracking system. ChatTracer comprises three key components: an array of Bluetooth sniffing nodes, a database, and a fine-tuned LLM. ChatTracer was designed based on our experimental observation that commercial Apple/Android devices always broadcast hundreds of BLE packets per minute even in their idle status. Its novelties lie in two aspects: i) a reliable and efficient BLE packet grouping algorithm; and ii) an LLM fine-tuning strategy that combines both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We have built a prototype of ChatTracer with four sniffing nodes. Experimental results show that ChatTracer not only outperforms existing localization approaches, but also provides an intelligent interface for user interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Mari, Andr\'e F. R. Guarda, Nuno M. M. Rodrigues, Simone Milani, Fernando Pereira</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread usage of point clouds (PC) for immersive visual applications has resulted in the use of very heterogeneous receiving conditions and devices, notably in terms of network, hardware, and display capabilities. In this scenario, quality scalability, i.e., the ability to reconstruct a signal at different qualities by progressively decoding a single bitstream, is a major requirement that has yet to be conveniently addressed, notably in most learning-based PC coding solutions. This paper proposes a quality scalability scheme, named Scalable Quality Hyperprior (SQH), adaptable to learning-based static point cloud geometry codecs, which uses a Quality-conditioned Latents Probability Estimator (QuLPE) to decode a high-quality version of a PC learning-based representation, based on an available lower quality base layer. SQH is integrated in the future JPEG PC coding standard, allowing to create a layered bitstream that can be used to progressively decode the PC geometry with increasing quality and fidelity. Experimental results show that SQH offers the quality scalability feature with very limited or no compression performance penalty at all when compared with the corresponding non-scalable solution, thus preserving the significant compression gains over other state-of-the-art PC codecs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincenzo Auletta, Diodato Ferraioli, Cosimo Vinci</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we study the problem of {\em Stochastic Budgeted Multi-round Submodular Maximization} (SBMSm), in which we would like to adaptively maximize the sum over multiple rounds of the value of a monotone and submodular objective function defined on a subset of items, subject to the fact that the values of this function depend on the realization of stochastic events and the number of items that we can select over all rounds is limited by a given budget. This problem extends, and generalizes to multiple round settings, well-studied problems such as (adaptive) influence maximization and stochastic probing.
  We first show that, if the number of items and stochastic events is somehow bounded, there is a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm for SBMSm. Then, we provide a simple greedy approximation algorithm for SBMSm, that first non-adaptively allocates the budget to be spent at each round, and then greedily and adaptively maximizes the objective function by using the budget assigned at each round. Such algorithm guarantees a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal adaptive value.
  Finally, by introducing a metric called {\em budget-adaptivity gap}, we measure how much an optimal policy for SBMSm, that is adaptive in both the budget allocation and item selection, is better than an optimal partially adaptive policy that, as in our greedy algorithm, determined the budget allocation in advance. We show a tight bound of $e/(e-1)$ on the budget-adaptivity gap, and this result implies that our greedy algorithm guarantees the best approximation among all partially adaptive policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yide Shentu, Philipp Wu, Aravind Rajeswaran, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies. With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Xia, Yi Zhang, Yiyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Federated Learning (FL) is promising in knowledge sharing for heterogeneous Artificial Intelligence of Thing (AIoT) devices, their training performance and energy efficacy are severely restricted in practical battery-driven scenarios due to the ``wooden barrel effect'' caused by the mismatch between homogeneous model paradigms and heterogeneous device capability. As a result, due to various kinds of differences among devices, it is hard for existing FL methods to conduct training effectively in energy-constrained scenarios, such as battery constraints of devices. To tackle the above issues, we propose an energy-aware FL framework named DR-FL, which considers the energy constraints in both clients and heterogeneous deep learning models to enable energy-efficient FL. Unlike Vanilla FL, DR-FL adopts our proposed Muti-Agents Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based dual-selection method, which allows participated devices to make contributions to the global model effectively and adaptively based on their computing capabilities and energy capacities in a MARL-based manner. Experiments conducted with various widely recognized datasets demonstrate that DR-FL has the capability to optimize the exchange of knowledge among diverse models in large-scale AIoT systems while adhering to energy limitations. Additionally, it improves the performance of each individual heterogeneous device's model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyu Xia, Bowen Yu, Yuan Wu, Yi Chang, Chang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we initiate our discussion by demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs), when tasked with responding to queries, display a more even probability distribution in their answers if they are more adept, as opposed to their less skilled counterparts. Expanding on this foundational insight, we propose a new self-evaluation method ProbDiff for assessing the efficacy of various LLMs. This approach obviates the necessity for an additional evaluation model or the dependence on external, proprietary models like GPT-4 for judgment. It uniquely utilizes the LLMs being tested to compute the probability discrepancy between the initial response and its revised versions. A higher discrepancy for a given query between two LLMs indicates a relatively weaker capability. Our findings reveal that ProbDiff achieves results on par with those obtained from evaluations based on GPT-4, spanning a range of scenarios that include natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as translation, summarization, and our proposed Xiaohongshu blog writing task, and benchmarks for LLM evaluation like AlignBench, MT-Bench, and AlpacaEval, across LLMs of varying magnitudes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqiang Lin, Sam Lockyer, Adrian Evans, Markus Zarbock, Nic Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMCT) has broad applications and forms the basis for numerous future city-wide systems (e.g. traffic management, crash detection, etc.). However, the challenge of matching vehicle trajectories across different cameras based solely on feature extraction poses significant difficulties. This article introduces an innovative multi-camera vehicle tracking system that utilizes a self-supervised camera link model. In contrast to related works that rely on manual spatial-temporal annotations, our model automatically extracts crucial multi-camera relationships for vehicle matching. The camera link is established through a pre-matching process that evaluates feature similarities, pair numbers, and time variance for high-quality tracks. This process calculates the probability of spatial linkage for all camera combinations, selecting the highest scoring pairs to create camera links. Our approach significantly improves deployment times by eliminating the need for human annotation, offering substantial improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness when it comes to real-world application. This pairing process supports cross camera matching by setting spatial-temporal constraints, reducing the searching space for potential vehicle matches. According to our experimental results, the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art among automatic camera-link based methods in CityFlow V2 benchmarks with 61.07% IDF1 Score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fake Lin, Xi Zhu, Ziwei Zhao, Deqiang Huang, Yu Yu, Xueying Li, Zhi Zheng, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of knowledge graph based recommendation system (KGRS), which enriches the representation of users, items, and entities by structural knowledge with striking improvement. Nevertheless, its unaffordable computational cost still limits researchers from exploring more sophisticated models. We observe that the bottleneck for training efficiency arises from the knowledge graph, which is plagued by the well-known issue of knowledge explosion. Recently, some works have attempted to slim the inflated KG via summarization techniques. However, these summarized nodes may ignore the collaborative signals and deviate from the facts that nodes in knowledge graph represent symbolic abstractions of entities from the real-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called KGTrimmer for knowledge graph pruning tailored for recommendation, to remove the unessential nodes while minimizing performance degradation. Specifically, we design an importance evaluator from a dual-view perspective. For the collective view, we embrace the idea of collective intelligence by extracting community consensus based on abundant collaborative signals, i.e. nodes are considered important if they attract attention of numerous users. For the holistic view, we learn a global mask to identify the valueless nodes from their inherent properties or overall popularity. Next, we build an end-to-end importance-aware graph neural network, which injects filtered knowledge to enhance the distillation of valuable user-item collaborative signals. Ultimately, we generate a pruned knowledge graph with lightweight, stable, and robust properties to facilitate the following-up recommendation task. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets to prove the effectiveness and generalization ability of KGTrimmer.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce "Future You," an interactive, brief, single-session, digital chat intervention designed to improve future self-continuity--the degree of connection an individual feels with a temporally distant future self--a characteristic that is positively related to mental health and wellbeing. Our system allows users to chat with a relatable yet AI-powered virtual version of their future selves that is tuned to their future goals and personal qualities. To make the conversation realistic, the system generates a "synthetic memory"--a unique backstory for each user--that creates a throughline between the user's present age (between 18-30) and their life at age 60. The "Future You" character also adopts the persona of an age-progressed image of the user's present self. After a brief interaction with the "Future You" character, users reported decreased anxiety, and increased future self-continuity. This is the first study successfully demonstrating the use of personalized AI-generated characters to improve users' future self-continuity and wellbeing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sion An, Myeongkyun Kang, Soopil Kim, Philip Chikontwe, Li Shen, Sang Hyun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) classification is a fundamental, yet challenging task due to the variation of signals between individuals i.e., inter-subject variability. Previous approaches try to mitigate this using task-specific (TS) EEG signals from the target subject in training. However, recording TS EEG signals requires time and limits its applicability in various fields. In contrast, resting state (RS) EEG signals are a viable alternative due to ease of acquisition with rich subject information. In this paper, we propose a novel subject-adaptive transfer learning strategy that utilizes RS EEG signals to adapt models on unseen subject data. Specifically, we disentangle extracted features into task- and subject-dependent features and use them to calibrate RS EEG signals for obtaining task information while preserving subject characteristics. The calibrated signals are then used to adapt the model to the target subject, enabling the model to simulate processing TS EEG signals of the target subject. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three public benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in cross-subject EEG MI classification. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging RS EEG signals to advance practical brain-computer interface systems. The code is available at https://github.com/SionAn/MICCAI2024-ResTL.</p>

<p>Abstract: As transformer-based object detection models progress, their impact in critical sectors like autonomous vehicles and aviation is expected to grow. Soft errors causing bit flips during inference have significantly impacted DNN performance, altering predictions. Traditional range restriction solutions for CNNs fall short for transformers. This study introduces the Global Clipper and Global Hybrid Clipper, effective mitigation strategies specifically designed for transformer-based models. It significantly enhances their resilience to soft errors and reduces faulty inferences to ~ 0\%. We also detail extensive testing across over 64 scenarios involving two transformer models (DINO-DETR and Lite-DETR) and two CNN models (YOLOv3 and SSD) using three datasets, totalling approximately 3.3 million inferences, to assess model robustness comprehensively. Moreover, the paper explores unique aspects of attention blocks in transformers and their operational differences from CNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffi Chern, Zhulin Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ethan Chern, Yuan Guo, Jiahe Jin, Binjie Wang, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous works on Large Language Models (LLMs) have mainly focused on evaluating their helpfulness or harmlessness. However, honesty, another crucial alignment criterion, has received relatively less attention. Dishonest behaviors in LLMs, such as spreading misinformation and defrauding users, present severe risks that intensify as these models approach superintelligent levels. Enhancing honesty in LLMs addresses critical limitations and helps uncover latent capabilities that are not readily expressed. This underscores the urgent need for reliable methods and benchmarks to effectively ensure and evaluate the honesty of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce BeHonest, a pioneering benchmark specifically designed to assess honesty in LLMs comprehensively. BeHonest evaluates three essential aspects of honesty: awareness of knowledge boundaries, avoidance of deceit, and consistency in responses. Building on this foundation, we designed 10 scenarios to evaluate and analyze 9 popular LLMs on the market, including both closed-source and open-source models from different model families with varied model sizes. Our findings indicate that there is still significant room for improvement in the honesty of LLMs. We encourage the AI community to prioritize honesty alignment in these models, which can harness their full potential to benefit society while preventing them from causing harm through deception or inconsistency.

<p>Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, our algorithm directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply our algorithm to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Wu, Jinshi Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing semi-supervised learning algorithms adopt pseudo-labeling and consistency regulation techniques to introduce supervision signals for unlabeled samples. To overcome the inherent limitation of threshold-based pseudo-labeling, prior studies have attempted to align the confidence threshold with the evolving learning status of the model, which is estimated through the predictions made on the unlabeled data. In this paper, we further reveal that classifier weights can reflect the differentiated learning status across categories and consequently propose a class-specific adaptive threshold mechanism. Additionally, considering that even the optimal threshold scheme cannot resolve the problem of discarding unlabeled samples, a binary classification consistency regulation approach is designed to distinguish candidate classes from negative options for all unlabeled samples. By combining the above strategies, we present a novel SSL algorithm named AllMatch, which achieves improved pseudo-label accuracy and a 100% utilization ratio for the unlabeled data. We extensively evaluate our approach on multiple benchmarks, encompassing both balanced and imbalanced settings. The results demonstrate that AllMatch consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by minimizing the need for complex feature engineering. However, the application of LLMs in specialized domains like biopharmaceuticals and chemistry remains largely unexplored. These fields are characterized by intricate terminologies, specialized knowledge, and a high demand for precision areas where general purpose LLMs often fall short. In this study, we introduce PharmaGPT, a suite of domain specilized LLMs with 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, specifically trained on a comprehensive corpus tailored to the Bio-Pharmaceutical and Chemical domains. Our evaluation shows that PharmaGPT surpasses existing general models on specific-domain benchmarks such as NAPLEX, demonstrating its exceptional capability in domain-specific tasks. Remarkably, this performance is achieved with a model that has only a fraction, sometimes just one-tenth-of the parameters of general-purpose large models. This advancement establishes a new benchmark for LLMs in the bio-pharmaceutical and chemical fields, addressing the existing gap in specialized language modeling. It also suggests a promising path for enhanced research and development, paving the way for more precise and effective NLP applications in these areas.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness across various generative tasks. However, when applied to medical image segmentation, these models encounter several challenges, including significant resource and time requirements. They also necessitate a multi-step reverse process and multiple samples to produce reliable predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the first latent diffusion segmentation model, named SDSeg, built upon stable diffusion (SD). SDSeg incorporates a straightforward latent estimation strategy to facilitate a single-step reverse process and utilizes latent fusion concatenation to remove the necessity for multiple samples. Extensive experiments indicate that SDSeg surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets featuring diverse imaging modalities. Remarkably, SDSeg is capable of generating stable predictions with a solitary reverse step and sample, epitomizing the model's stability as implied by its name.

<p>Abstract: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hwanjun Song, Hang Su, Igor Shalyminov, Jason Cai, Saab Mansour</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated evaluation is crucial for streamlining text summarization benchmarking and model development, given the costly and time-consuming nature of human evaluation. Traditional methods like ROUGE do not correlate well with human judgment, while recently proposed LLM-based metrics provide only summary-level assessment using Likert-scale scores. This limits deeper model analysis, e.g., we can only assign one hallucination score at the summary level, while at the sentence level, we can count sentences containing hallucinations. To remedy those limitations, we propose FineSurE, a fine-grained evaluator specifically tailored for the summarization task using large language models (LLMs). It also employs completeness and conciseness criteria, in addition to faithfulness, enabling multi-dimensional assessment. We compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs as backbones for FineSurE. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmarking of FineSurE against SOTA methods including NLI-, QA-, and LLM-based methods, showing improved performance especially on the completeness and conciseness dimensions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Chen, Shuohang Wang, Ziyi Yang, Hiteshi Sharma, Nikos Karampatziakis, Donghan Yu, Kevin Jamieson, Simon Shaolei Du, Yelong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), as a widely adopted approach in current large language model pipelines, is \textit{bottlenecked by the size of human preference data}. While traditional methods rely on offline preference dataset constructions, recent approaches have shifted towards online settings, where a learner uses a small amount of labeled seed data and a large pool of unlabeled prompts to iteratively construct new preference data through self-generated responses and high-quality reward/preference feedback. However, most current online algorithms still focus on preference labeling during policy model updating with given feedback oracles, which incurs significant expert query costs. \textit{We are the first to explore cost-effective proxy reward oracles construction strategies for further labeling preferences or rewards with extremely limited labeled data and expert query budgets}. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) on-policy query to avoid OOD and imbalance issues in seed data, and (2) active learning to select the most informative data for preference queries. Using these methods, we train a evaluation model with minimal expert-labeled data, which then effectively labels nine times more preference pairs for further RLHF training. For instance, our model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) gains around over 1% average improvement on AlpacaEval2, MMLU-5shot and MMLU-0shot, with only 1.7K query cost. Our methodology is orthogonal to other direct expert query-based strategies and therefore might be integrated with them to further reduce query costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasna Chouikhi, Manel Aloui, Cyrine Ben Hammou, Ghaith Chaabane, Haithem Kchaou, Chehir Dhaouadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly impacted the natural language processing (NLP) field, particularly for the English language. These models have demonstrated capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The success of language models largely depends on the availability of high-quality instruction datasets, which consist of detailed task descriptions and corresponding responses that are essential for training the models to address a variety of prompts accurately. However, the availability and quality of these resources vary by language. While models perform well in English, they often need help with languages like Arabic, due to the lack of datasets for fine-tuning Arabic-specific tasks. To address this issue, we introduce InstAr-500k, a new Arabic instruction dataset created by generating and collecting content that covers several domains and instruction types. We assess this dataset by fine-tuning an open-source Gemma-7B model on several downstream tasks to improve its functionality. Based on multiple evaluations, our fine-tuned model achieves excellent performance on several Arabic NLP benchmarks. These outcomes emphasize the effectiveness of our dataset in elevating the capabilities of language models for Arabic. Our instruction dataset bridges the performance gap between English and Arabic language models by providing resources that amplify Arabic NLP development. Building on this foundation, we developed a model, GemmAr-7B-V1, specifically tuned to excel at a wide range of Arabic NLP tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxu Tao, Chen Zhang, Quzhe Huang, Tianyao Ma, Songfang Huang, Dongyan Zhao, Yansong Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to new languages typically involves continual pre-training (CT) followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, this CT-then-SFT approach struggles with limited data in the context of low-resource languages, failing to balance language modeling and task-solving capabilities. We thus propose model merging as an alternative for low-resource languages, combining models with distinct capabilities into a single model without additional training. We use model merging to develop task-solving LLMs for low-resource languages without SFT data in the target languages. Our experiments based on Llama-2-7B demonstrate that model merging effectively endows LLMs for low-resource languages with task-solving abilities, outperforming CT-then-SFT in scenarios with extremely scarce data. Observing performance saturation in model merging with more training tokens, we further analyze the merging process and introduce a slack variable to the model merging algorithm to mitigate the loss of important parameters, thereby enhancing performance. We hope that model merging can benefit more human languages suffering from data scarcity with its higher data efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report introduces FunAudioLLM, a model family designed to enhance natural voice interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs). At its core are two innovative models: SenseVoice, which handles multilingual speech recognition, emotion recognition, and audio event detection; and CosyVoice, which facilitates natural speech generation with control over multiple languages, timbre, speaking style, and speaker identity. SenseVoice-Small delivers exceptionally low-latency ASR for 5 languages, and SenseVoice-Large supports high-precision ASR for over 50 languages, while CosyVoice excels in multi-lingual voice generation, zero-shot in-context learning, cross-lingual voice cloning, and instruction-following capabilities. The models related to SenseVoice and CosyVoice have been open-sourced on Modelscope and Huggingface, along with the corresponding training, inference, and fine-tuning codes released on GitHub. By integrating these models with LLMs, FunAudioLLM enables applications such as speech-to-speech translation, emotional voice chat, interactive podcasts, and expressive audiobook narration, thereby pushing the boundaries of voice interaction technology. Demos are available at https://fun-audio-llm.github.io, and the code can be accessed at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengpeng Li, Guanting Dong, Mingfeng Xue, Ru Peng, Xiang Wang, Dayiheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive progress in handling simple math problems, yet they still struggle with more challenging and complex mathematical tasks. In this paper, we introduce a series of LLMs that employs the Decomposition of thought with code assistance and self-correction for mathematical reasoning, dubbed as DotaMath. DotaMath models tackle complex mathematical tasks by decomposing them into simpler logical subtasks, leveraging code to solve these subtasks, obtaining fine-grained feedback from the code interpreter, and engaging in self-reflection and correction. By annotating diverse interactive tool-use trajectories and employing query evolution on GSM8K and MATH datasets, we generate an instruction fine-tuning dataset called DotaMathQA with 574K query-response pairs. We train a series of base LLMs using imitation learning on DotaMathQA, resulting in DotaMath models that achieve remarkable performance compared to open-source LLMs across various in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Notably, DotaMath-deepseek-7B showcases an outstanding performance of 64.8% on the competitive MATH dataset and 86.7% on GSM8K. Besides, DotaMath-deepseek-7B maintains strong competitiveness on a series of in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (Avg. 80.1%). Looking forward, we anticipate that the DotaMath paradigm will open new pathways for addressing intricate mathematical problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyu Yang, Naveed Akhtar, Mubarak Shah, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning necessitates meticulous regulation of model reliance on non-robust features. We propose a framework to delineate and regulate such features by attributing model predictions to the input. Within our approach, robust feature attributions exhibit a certain consistency, while non-robust feature attributions are susceptible to fluctuations. This behavior allows identification of correlation between model reliance on non-robust features and smoothness of marginal density of the input samples. Hence, we uniquely regularize the gradients of the marginal density w.r.t. the input features for robustness. We also devise an efficient implementation of our regularization to address the potential numerical instability of the underlying optimization process. Moreover, we analytically reveal that, as opposed to our marginal density smoothing, the prevalent input gradient regularization smoothens conditional or joint density of the input, which can cause limited robustness. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing clear evidence of its capability to address the feature leakage problem and mitigate spurious correlations. Extensive results further establish that our technique enables the model to exhibit robustness against perturbations in pixel values, input gradients, and density.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04472">EventChat: Implementation and user-centric evaluation of a large language model-driven conversational recommender system for exploring leisure events in an SME context</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannes Kunstmann, Joseph Ollier, Joel Persson, Florian von Wangenheim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present an enormous evolution in the strategic potential of conversational recommender systems (CRS). Yet to date, research has predominantly focused upon technical frameworks to implement LLM-driven CRS, rather than end-user evaluations or strategic implications for firms, particularly from the perspective of a small to medium enterprises (SME) that makeup the bedrock of the global economy. In the current paper, we detail the design of an LLM-driven CRS in an SME setting, and its subsequent performance in the field using both objective system metrics and subjective user evaluations. While doing so, we additionally outline a short-form revised ResQue model for evaluating LLM-driven CRS, enabling replicability in a rapidly evolving field. Our results reveal good system performance from a user experience perspective (85.5% recommendation accuracy) but underscore latency, cost, and quality issues challenging business viability. Notably, with a median cost of $0.04 per interaction and a latency of 5.7s, cost-effectiveness and response time emerge as crucial areas for achieving a more user-friendly and economically viable LLM-driven CRS for SME settings. One major driver of these costs is the use of an advanced LLM as a ranker within the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. Our results additionally indicate that relying solely on approaches such as Prompt-based learning with ChatGPT as the underlying LLM makes it challenging to achieve satisfying quality in a production environment. Strategic considerations for SMEs deploying an LLM-driven CRS are outlined, particularly considering trade-offs in the current technical landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we first give an introduction to the theoretical basis of the privacy-utility equilibrium in federated learning based on Bayesian privacy definitions and total variation distance privacy definitions. We then present the \textit{Learn-to-Distort-Data} framework, which provides a principled approach to navigate the privacy-utility equilibrium by explicitly modeling the distortion introduced by the privacy-preserving mechanism as a learnable variable and optimizing it jointly with the model parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework to a variety of privacy-preserving mechanisms on the basis of data distortion and highlight its connections to related areas such as adversarial training, input robustness, and unlearnable examples. These connections enable leveraging techniques from these areas to design effective algorithms for privacy-utility equilibrium in federated learning under the \textit{Learn-to-Distort-Data} framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Jarca, Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Curriculum by Masking (CBM), a novel state-of-the-art curriculum learning strategy that effectively creates an easy-to-hard training schedule via patch (token) masking, offering significant accuracy improvements over the conventional training regime and previous curriculum learning (CL) methods. CBM leverages gradient magnitudes to prioritize the masking of salient image regions via a novel masking algorithm and a novel masking block. Our approach enables controlling sample difficulty via the patch masking ratio, generating an effective easy-to-hard curriculum by gradually introducing harder samples as training progresses. CBM operates with two easily configurable parameters, i.e. the number of patches and the curriculum schedule, making it a versatile curriculum learning approach for object recognition and detection. We conduct experiments with various neural architectures, ranging from convolutional networks to vision transformers, on five benchmark data sets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Food-101 and PASCAL VOC), to compare CBM with conventional as well as curriculum-based training regimes. Our results reveal the superiority of our strategy compared with the state-of-the-art curriculum learning regimes. We also observe improvements in transfer learning contexts, where CBM surpasses previous work by considerable margins in terms of accuracy. We release our code for free non-commercial use at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/CBM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Du, Qian Chen, Shiliang Zhang, Kai Hu, Heng Lu, Yexin Yang, Hangrui Hu, Siqi Zheng, Yue Gu, Ziyang Ma, Zhifu Gao, Zhijie Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a trend that large language model (LLM) based text-to-speech (TTS) emerges into the mainstream due to their high naturalness and zero-shot capacity. In this paradigm, speech signals are discretized into token sequences, which are modeled by an LLM with text as prompts and reconstructed by a token-based vocoder to waveforms. Obviously, speech tokens play a critical role in LLM-based TTS models. Current speech tokens are learned in an unsupervised manner, which lacks explicit semantic information and alignment to the text. In this paper, we propose to represent speech with supervised semantic tokens, which are derived from a multilingual speech recognition model by inserting vector quantization into the encoder. Based on the tokens, we further propose a scalable zero-shot TTS synthesizer, CosyVoice, which consists of an LLM for text-to-token generation and a conditional flow matching model for token-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results show that supervised semantic tokens significantly outperform existing unsupervised tokens in terms of content consistency and speaker similarity for zero-shot voice cloning. Moreover, we find that utilizing large-scale data further improves the synthesis performance, indicating the scalable capacity of CosyVoice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to involve supervised speech tokens into TTS models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijun Gan, Wentong Li, Jinwei Ren, Jianke Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity hand models with intricate textures plays a crucial role in enhancing human-object interaction and advancing real-world applications. Despite the state-of-the-art methods excelling in texture generation and image rendering, they often face challenges in accurately capturing geometric details. Learning-based approaches usually offer better robustness and faster inference, which tend to produce smoother results and require substantial amounts of training data. To address these issues, we present a novel fine-grained multi-view hand mesh reconstruction method that leverages inverse rendering to restore hand poses and intricate details. Firstly, our approach predicts a parametric hand mesh model through Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) based method from multi-view images. We further introduce a novel Hand Albedo and Mesh (HAM) optimization module to refine both the hand mesh and textures, which is capable of preserving the mesh topology. In addition, we suggest an effective mesh-based neural rendering scheme to simultaneously generate photo-realistic image and optimize mesh geometry by fusing the pre-trained rendering network with vertex features. We conduct the comprehensive experiments on InterHand2.6M, DeepHandMesh and dataset collected by ourself, whose promising results show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ping Yu, Jing Xu, Jason Weston, Ilia Kulikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spend extra compute during inference to generate intermediate thoughts, which helps to produce better final responses. Since Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), many such System 2 techniques have been proposed such as Rephrase and Respond (Deng et al., 2023a), System 2 Attention (Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023) and Branch-Solve-Merge (Saha et al., 2023). In this work we investigate self-supervised methods to ``compile'' (distill) higher quality outputs from System 2 techniques back into LLM generations without intermediate reasoning token sequences, as this reasoning has been distilled into System 1. We show that several such techniques can be successfully distilled, resulting in improved results compared to the original System 1 performance, and with less inference cost than System 2. We posit that such System 2 distillation will be an important feature of future continually learning AI systems, enabling them to focus System 2 capabilities on the reasoning tasks that they cannot yet do well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Netz, Jan Reimer, Bernhard Rumpe</p>
<p>Abstract: We present and evaluate a method called grammar masking, which is used to guide large language models (LLMs) toward producing syntactically correct models for a given context-free grammar. Prompt engineering methods such as few-shot learning or priming can be used to improve the chances of an LLM producing correct syntax, but the more complex the grammar, the more time-consuming and less promising these methods become. Previous work is focused primarily on the usage of either language model training or prompt engineering. In this work, a method is presented that restricts the output to a given grammar using constrained decoding to ensure the output adheres to a valid syntax. We use several DSLs built with MontiCore and task multiple LLMs to produce models with and without constrained decoding. A corresponding parser is used to confirm the syntactic correctness of each model. We show that grammar masking can dramatically improve the modeling capabilities of several LLMs, reducing the need for well-refined prompting while increasing the chance of producing correct models.</p>
