<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Shi, Shanglin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fashion, deeply rooted in sociocultural dynamics, evolves as individuals emulate styles popularized by influencers and iconic figures. In the quest to replicate such refined tastes using artificial intelligence, traditional fashion ensemble methods have primarily used supervised learning to imitate the decisions of style icons, which falter when faced with distribution shifts, leading to style replication discrepancies triggered by slight variations in input. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have become prominent across various sectors, recognized for their user-friendly interfaces, strong conversational skills, and advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Fashion Large Language Model (FLLM), which employs auto-prompt generation training strategies to enhance its capacity for delivering personalized fashion advice while retaining essential domain knowledge. Additionally, by integrating a retrieval augmentation technique during inference, the model can better adjust to individual preferences. Our results show that this approach surpasses existing models in accuracy, interpretability, and few-shot learning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivaan Sandwar, Bhav Jain, Rishan Thangaraj, Ishaan Garg, Michael Lam, Kevin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Debate is a commonly used form of human communication catered towards problem-solving because of its efficiency. Debate fundamentally allows multiple viewpoints to be brought up in problem-solving, and for complex problems, each viewpoint opens a new path for problem-solving. In this work, we apply this concept to LLM decision-making by proposing town hall-style debate prompting (THDP), a prompting method that splices a language model into multiple personas that will debate one another to reach a conclusion. Our experimental pipeline varies both the number of personas and the personality types of each persona to find the optimum town hall size and personality for benchmark performance as measured by ZebraLogic bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark characterized by both multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. Our experimental results demonstrate that a town hall size of 5 personas with LLM-determined personality types performs optimally on ZebraLogic, achieving a 13\% improvement over one-shot CoT baselines in per-cell accuracy in GPT-4o, 9% puzzle accuracy increase in Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and an improvement in hard puzzle accuracy from 10-15%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gautam Kishore Shahi, Oliver Hummel</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a multitude of application opportunities. One traditional task for Information Retrieval systems is the summarization and classification of texts, both of which are important for supporting humans in navigating large literature bodies as they e.g. exist with scientific publications. Due to this rapidly growing body of scientific knowledge, recent research has been aiming at building research information systems that not only offer traditional keyword search capabilities, but also novel features such as the automatic detection of research areas that are present at knowledge intensive organizations in academia and industry. To facilitate this idea, we present the results obtained from evaluating a variety of LLMs in their ability to sort scientific publications into hierarchical classifications systems. Using the FORC dataset as ground truth data, we have found that recent LLMs (such as Meta Llama 3.1) are able to reach an accuracy of up to 0.82, which is up to 0.08 better than traditional BERT models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rawand Alfugaha, Mohammad AL-Smadi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on SemEval-2020 Task 4 dataset, focusing on commonsense validation and explanation. Our methodology involves evaluating multiple LLMs, including LLaMA3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Mixtral-8x7B, using zero-shot prompting techniques. The models are tested on two tasks: Task A (Commonsense Validation), where models determine whether a statement aligns with commonsense knowledge, and Task B (Commonsense Explanation), where models identify the reasoning behind implausible statements. Performance is assessed based on accuracy, and results are compared to fine-tuned transformer-based models. The results indicate that larger models outperform previous models and perform closely to human evaluation for Task A, with LLaMA3-70B achieving the highest accuracy of 98.40% in Task A whereas, lagging behind previous models with 93.40% in Task B. However, while models effectively identify implausible statements, they face challenges in selecting the most relevant explanation, highlighting limitations in causal and inferential reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyanendra Shrestha, Chutain Jiang, Sai Akula, Vivek Yannam, Anna Pyayt, Michael Gubanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Embeddings serve as condensed vector representations for real-world entities, finding applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Data Management across diverse downstream tasks. Here, we introduce novel specialized embeddings optimized, and explicitly tailored to encode the intricacies of complex 2-D context in tables, featuring horizontal, vertical hierarchical metadata, and nesting. To accomplish that we define the Bi-dimensional tabular coordinates, separate horizontal, vertical metadata and data contexts by introducing a new visibility matrix, encode units and nesting through the embeddings specifically optimized for mimicking intricacies of such complex structured data. Through evaluation on 5 large-scale structured datasets and 3 popular downstream tasks, we observed that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art models with the significant MAP delta of up to 0.28. GPT-4 LLM+RAG slightly outperforms us with MRR delta of up to 0.1, while we outperform it with the MAP delta of up to 0.42.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keane Ong, Rui Mao, Deeksha Varshney, Erik Cambria, Gianmarco Mengaldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental, social and governance, ESG performance, but their content is increasingly obscured by greenwashing - sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Yet, existing NLP approaches for ESG analysis lack robustness against greenwashing risks, often extracting insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce A3CG - Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahyun Jung, Jaehyung Seo, Jaewook Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often retain outdated or incorrect information from pre-training, which undermines their reliability. While model editing methods have been developed to address such errors without full re-training, they frequently suffer from knowledge conflicts, where outdated information interferes with new knowledge. In this work, we propose Conflict-free Model Editing (CoME), a novel framework that enhances the accuracy of knowledge updates in LLMs by selectively removing outdated knowledge. CoME leverages unlearning to mitigate knowledge interference, allowing new information to be integrated without compromising relevant linguistic features. Through experiments on GPT-J and LLaMA-3 using Counterfact and ZsRE datasets, we demonstrate that CoME improves both editing accuracy and model reliability when applied to existing editing methods. Our results highlight that the targeted removal of outdated knowledge is crucial for enhancing model editing effectiveness and maintaining the model's generative performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuchen Cao, Sven Apel, Adish Singla, Vera Demberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed to produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using one of the latest LLMs on a popular code generation dataset. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15836">Soft Token Attacks Cannot Reliably Audit Unlearning in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Chen, Sebastian Szyller, Weilin Xu, Nageen Himayat</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular. Their emergent capabilities can be attributed to their massive training datasets. However, these datasets often contain undesirable or inappropriate content, e.g., harmful texts, personal information, and copyrighted material. This has promoted research into machine unlearning that aims to remove information from trained models. In particular, approximate unlearning seeks to achieve information removal by strategically editing the model rather than complete model retraining.
  Recent work has shown that soft token attacks (STA) can successfully extract purportedly unlearned information from LLMs, thereby exposing limitations in current unlearning methodologies. In this work, we reveal that STAs are an inadequate tool for auditing unlearning. Through systematic evaluation on common unlearning benchmarks (Who Is Harry Potter? and TOFU), we demonstrate that such attacks can elicit any information from the LLM, regardless of (1) the deployed unlearning algorithm, and (2) whether the queried content was originally present in the training corpus. Furthermore, we show that STA with just a few soft tokens (1-10) can elicit random strings over 400-characters long. Thus showing that STAs are too powerful, and misrepresent the effectiveness of the unlearning methods.
  Our work highlights the need for better evaluation baselines, and more appropriate auditing tools for assessing the effectiveness of unlearning in LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15844">Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models with Metamorphic Relations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Borui Yang, Md Afif Al Mamun, Jie M. Zhang, Gias Uddin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score). For instance, with Mistral-7B, MetaQA achieves an average F1-score of 0.435, compared to SelfCheckGPT's F1-score of 0.205, representing an improvement rate of 112.2%. MetaQA also demonstrates superiority across all different categories of questions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15845">Verify when Uncertain: Beyond Self-Consistency in Black Box Hallucination Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Xue, Kristjan Greenewald, Youssef Mroueh, Baharan Mirzasoleiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucination problems, which hinder their reliability in sensitive applications. In the black-box setting, several self-consistency-based techniques have been proposed for hallucination detection. We empirically study these techniques and show that they achieve performance close to that of a supervised (still black-box) oracle, suggesting little room for improvement within this paradigm. To address this limitation, we explore cross-model consistency checking between the target model and an additional verifier LLM. With this extra information, we observe improved oracle performance compared to purely self-consistency-based methods. We then propose a budget-friendly, two-stage detection algorithm that calls the verifier model only for a subset of cases. It dynamically switches between self-consistency and cross-consistency based on an uncertainty interval of the self-consistency classifier. We provide a geometric interpretation of consistency-based hallucination detection methods through the lens of kernel mean embeddings, offering deeper theoretical insights. Extensive experiments show that this approach maintains high detection performance while significantly reducing computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Govind Pimpale, Axel H{\o}jmark, J\'er\'emy Scheurer, Marius Hobbhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: As Language Models (LMs) increasingly operate as autonomous agents, accurately forecasting their capabilities becomes crucial for societal preparedness. We evaluate six forecasting methods that predict downstream capabilities of LM agents. We use "one-step" approaches that predict benchmark scores from input metrics like compute or model release date directly or "two-step" approaches that first predict an intermediate metric like the principal component of cross-benchmark performance (PC-1) and human-evaluated competitive Elo ratings. We evaluate our forecasting methods by backtesting them on a dataset of 38 LMs from the OpenLLM 2 leaderboard. We then use the validated two-step approach (Release Date$\to$Elo$\to$Benchmark) to predict LM agent performance for frontier models on three benchmarks: SWE-Bench Verified (software development), Cybench (cybersecurity assessment), and RE-Bench (ML research engineering). Our forecast predicts that by the beginning of 2026, non-specialized LM agents with low capability elicitation will reach a success rate of 54% on SWE-Bench Verified, while state-of-the-art LM agents will reach an 87% success rate. Our approach does not account for recent advances in inference-compute scaling and might thus be too conservative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilin Geng, Haonan Li, Honglin Mu, Xudong Han, Timothy Baldwin, Omri Abend, Eduard Hovy, Lea Frermann</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with hierarchical instruction schemes, where certain instructions (e.g., system-level directives) are expected to take precedence over others (e.g., user messages). Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of how effectively these hierarchical control mechanisms work. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework based on constraint prioritization to assess how well LLMs enforce instruction hierarchies. Our experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that models struggle with consistent instruction prioritization, even for simple formatting conflicts. We find that the widely-adopted system/user prompt separation fails to establish a reliable instruction hierarchy, and models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraint types regardless of their priority designation. While controlled prompt engineering and model fine-tuning show modest improvements, our results indicate that instruction hierarchy enforcement is not robustly realized, calling for deeper architectural innovations beyond surface-level modifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Fan, Guoqiang Ma, Yuanfeng Song, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into task-specific Small Language Models (SLMs) encounters two significant challenges: safeguarding domain-specific knowledge privacy and managing limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose PPC-GPT, a innovative privacy-preserving federated framework specifically designed for compressing LLMs into task-specific SLMs via pruning and Chain-of-Thought (COT) distillation. PPC-GPT works on a server-client federated architecture, where the client sends differentially private (DP) perturbed task-specific data to the server's LLM. The LLM then generates synthetic data along with their corresponding rationales. This synthetic data is subsequently used for both LLM pruning and retraining processes. Additionally, we harness COT knowledge distillation, leveraging the synthetic data to further improve the retraining of structurally-pruned SLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPC-GPT across various text generation tasks. By compressing LLMs into task-specific SLMs, PPC-GPT not only achieves competitive performance but also prioritizes data privacy protection.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the role of LLM-generated synthetic data in cyberbullying detection. We conduct a series of experiments where we replace some or all of the authentic data with synthetic data, or augment the authentic data with synthetic data. We find that synthetic cyberbullying data can be the basis for training a classifier for harm detection that reaches performance close to that of a classifier trained with authentic data. Combining authentic with synthetic data shows improvements over the baseline of training on authentic data alone for the test data for all three LLMs tried. These results highlight the viability of synthetic data as a scalable, ethically viable alternative in cyberbullying detection while emphasizing the critical impact of LLM selection on performance outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaid Khan, Ali Farhadi, Ranjay Krishna, Luca Weihs, Mohit Bansal, Tanmay Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: When a human requests an LLM to complete a coding task using functionality from a large code repository, how do we provide context from the repo to the LLM? One approach is to add the entire repo to the LLM's context window. However, most tasks involve only fraction of symbols from a repo, longer contexts are detrimental to the LLM's reasoning abilities, and context windows are not unlimited. Alternatively, we could emulate the human ability to navigate a large repo, pick out the right functionality, and form a plan to solve the task. We propose MutaGReP (Mutation-guided Grounded Repository Plan Search), an approach to search for plans that decompose a user request into natural language steps grounded in the codebase. MutaGReP performs neural tree search in plan space, exploring by mutating plans and using a symbol retriever for grounding. On the challenging LongCodeArena benchmark, our plans use less than 5% of the 128K context window for GPT-4o but rival the coding performance of GPT-4o with a context window filled with the repo. Plans produced by MutaGReP allow Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B and 72B to match the performance of GPT-4o with full repo context and enable progress on the hardest LongCodeArena tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leila Arras, Bruno Puri, Patrick Kahardipraja, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek</p>
<p>Abstract: Various XAI attribution methods have been recently proposed for the transformer architecture, allowing for insights into the decision-making process of large language models by assigning importance scores to input tokens and intermediate representations. One class of methods that seems very promising in this direction includes decomposition-based approaches, i.e., XAI-methods that redistribute the model's prediction logit through the network, as this value is directly related to the prediction. In the previous literature we note though that two prominent methods of this category, namely ALTI-Logit and LRP, have not yet been analyzed in juxtaposition and hence we propose to close this gap by conducting a careful quantitative evaluation w.r.t. ground truth annotations on a subject-verb agreement task, as well as various qualitative inspections, using BERT, GPT-2 and LLaMA-3 as a testbed. Along the way we compare and extend the ALTI-Logit and LRP methods, including the recently proposed AttnLRP variant, from an algorithmic and implementation perspective. We further incorporate in our benchmark two widely-used gradient-based attribution techniques. Finally, we make our carefullly constructed benchmark dataset for evaluating attributions on language models, as well as our code, publicly available in order to foster evaluation of XAI-methods on a well-defined common ground.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive datasets can lead them to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information, raising ethical and privacy concerns. While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Esethu Framework, a sustainable data curation framework specifically designed to empower local communities and ensure equitable benefit-sharing from their linguistic resources. This framework is supported by the Esethu license, a novel community-centric data license. As a proof of concept, we introduce the Vuk'uzenzele isiXhosa Speech Dataset (ViXSD), an open-source corpus developed under the Esethu Framework and License. The dataset, containing read speech from native isiXhosa speakers enriched with demographic and linguistic metadata, demonstrates how community-driven licensing and curation principles can bridge resource gaps in automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages while safeguarding the interests of data creators. We describe the framework guiding dataset development, outline the Esethu license provisions, present the methodology for ViXSD, and present ASR experiments validating ViXSD's usability in building and refining voice-driven applications for isiXhosa.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minzhi Li, William Barr Held, Michael J Ryan, Kunat Pipatanakul, Potsawee Manakul, Hao Zhu, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI chatbots become ubiquitous, voice interaction presents a compelling way to enable rapid, high-bandwidth communication for both semantic and social signals. This has driven research into Large Audio Models (LAMs) to power voice-native experiences. However, aligning LAM development with user goals requires a clear understanding of user needs and preferences to establish reliable progress metrics. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an interactive approach to evaluate LAMs and collecting 7,500 LAM interactions from 484 participants. Through topic modeling of user queries, we identify primary use cases for audio interfaces. We then analyze user preference rankings and qualitative feedback to determine which models best align with user needs. Finally, we evaluate how static benchmarks predict interactive performance - our analysis reveals no individual benchmark strongly correlates with interactive results ($\tau \leq 0.33$ for all benchmarks). While combining multiple coarse-grained features yields modest predictive power ($R^2$=$0.30$), only two out of twenty datasets on spoken question answering and age prediction show significantly positive correlations. This suggests a clear need to develop LAM evaluations that better correlate with user preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Zhuang, Xiaodong Yu, Jialian Wu, Ximeng Sun, Ze Wang, Jiang Liu, Yusheng Su, Jingbo Shang, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and context retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15924">Improving Consistency in Large Language Models through Chain of Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Raj, Vipul Gupta, Domenic Rosati, Subhabrata Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency is a fundamental dimension of trustworthiness in Large Language Models (LLMs). For humans to be able to trust LLM-based applications, their outputs should be consistent when prompted with inputs that carry the same meaning or intent. Despite this need, there is no known mechanism to control and guide LLMs to be more consistent at inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment strategy to maximize semantic consistency in LLM outputs. Our proposal is based on Chain of Guidance (CoG), a multistep prompting technique that generates highly consistent outputs from LLMs. For closed-book question-answering (Q&A) tasks, when compared to direct prompting, the outputs generated using CoG show improved consistency. While other approaches like template-based responses and majority voting may offer alternative paths to consistency, our work focuses on exploring the potential of guided prompting. We use synthetic data sets comprised of consistent input-output pairs to fine-tune LLMs to produce consistent and correct outputs. Our fine-tuned models are more than twice as consistent compared to base models and show strong generalization capabilities by producing consistent outputs over datasets not used in the fine-tuning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) publishes over a thousand new vulnerabilities monthly, with a projected 25 percent increase in 2024, highlighting the crucial need for rapid vulnerability identification to mitigate cybersecurity attacks and save costs and resources. In this work, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to learn vulnerability evaluation from historical assessments of medical device vulnerabilities in a single manufacturer's portfolio. We highlight the effectiveness and challenges of using LLMs for automatic vulnerability evaluation and introduce a method to enrich historical data with cybersecurity ontologies, enabling the system to understand new vulnerabilities without retraining the LLM. Our LLM system integrates with the in-house application - Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) - to help Siemens Healthineers (SHS) product cybersecurity experts efficiently assess the vulnerabilities in our products.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean Wu, Michael Koo, Fabien Scalzo, Ira Kurtz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated performance in medical and other fields of knowledge. Traditional methods of creating specialist LLMs require extensive fine-tuning and training of models on large datasets. Recently, prompt engineering, instead of fine-tuning, has shown potential to boost the performance of general foundation models. However, prompting methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT) may not be suitable for all subspecialty, and k-shot approaches may introduce irrelevant tokens into the context space. We present AutoMedPrompt, which explores the use of textual gradients to elicit medically relevant reasoning through system prompt optimization. AutoMedPrompt leverages TextGrad's automatic differentiation via text to improve the ability of general foundation LLMs. We evaluated AutoMedPrompt on Llama 3, an open-source LLM, using several QA benchmarks, including MedQA, PubMedQA, and the nephrology subspecialty-specific NephSAP. Our results show that prompting with textual gradients outperforms previous methods on open-source LLMs and surpasses proprietary models such as GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, and Med-PaLM 2. AutoMedPrompt sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PubMedQA with an accuracy of 82.6$\%$, while also outperforming previous prompting strategies on open-sourced models for MedQA (77.7$\%$) and NephSAP (63.8$\%$).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifu Zhan, Jun Wang, Shuang Zhou, Jiawen Deng, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To optimize in-context learning in biomedical natural language processing by improving example selection. Methods: We introduce a novel multi-mode retrieval-augmented generation (MMRAG) framework, which integrates four retrieval strategies: (1) Random Mode, selecting examples arbitrarily; (2) Top Mode, retrieving the most relevant examples based on similarity; (3) Diversity Mode, ensuring variation in selected examples; and (4) Class Mode, selecting category-representative examples. This study evaluates MMRAG on three core biomedical NLP tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Text Classification (TC). The datasets used include BC2GM for gene and protein mention recognition (NER), DDI for drug-drug interaction extraction (RE), GIT for general biomedical information extraction (RE), and HealthAdvice for health-related text classification (TC). The framework is tested with two large language models (Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B) and three retrievers (Contriever, MedCPT, BGE-Large) to assess performance across different retrieval strategies. Results: The results from the Random mode indicate that providing more examples in the prompt improves the model's generation performance. Meanwhile, Top mode and Diversity mode significantly outperform Random mode on the RE (DDI) task, achieving an F1 score of 0.9669, a 26.4% improvement. Among the three retrievers tested, Contriever outperformed the other two in a greater number of experiments. Additionally, Llama 2 and Llama 3 demonstrated varying capabilities across different tasks, with Llama 3 showing a clear advantage in handling NER tasks. Conclusion: MMRAG effectively enhances biomedical in-context learning by refining example selection, mitigating data scarcity issues, and demonstrating superior adaptability for NLP-driven healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqiang Wang, Suyuchen Wang, Yun Zhu, Bang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory plays a key role in enhancing LLMs' performance when deployed to real-world applications. Existing solutions face trade-offs: explicit memory designs based on external storage require complex management and incur storage overhead, while implicit memory designs that store information via parameters struggle with reliable retrieval. In this paper, we propose R$^3$Mem, a memory network that optimizes both information Retention and Retrieval through Reversible context compression. Specifically, R$^3$Mem employs virtual memory tokens to compress and encode infinitely long histories, further enhanced by a hierarchical compression strategy that refines information from document- to entity-level for improved assimilation across granularities. For retrieval, R$^3$Mem employs a reversible architecture, reconstructing raw data by invoking the model backward with compressed information. Implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it can integrate seamlessly with any Transformer-based model. Experiments demonstrate that our memory design achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-context language modeling and retrieval-augmented generation tasks. It also significantly outperforms conventional memory modules in long-horizon interaction tasks like conversational agents, showcasing its potential for next-generation retrieval systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesus Rios, Pierre Dognin, Ronny Luss, Karthikeyan N. Ramamurthy</p>
<p>Abstract: Full fine-tuning of large language models for alignment and task adaptation has become prohibitively expensive as models have grown in size. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim at significantly reducing the computational and memory resources needed for fine-tuning these models by only training on a small number of parameters instead of all model parameters. Currently, the most popular PEFT method is the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which freezes the parameters of the model to be fine-tuned and introduces a small set of trainable parameters in the form of low-rank matrices. We propose simply reducing the number of trainable parameters by randomly selecting a small proportion of the model parameters to train on. In this paper, we compare the efficiency and performance of our proposed approach with PEFT methods, including LoRA, as well as full parameter fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel contextual embedding model med-gte-hybrid that was derived from the gte-large sentence transformer to extract information from unstructured clinical narratives. Our model tuning strategy for med-gte-hybrid combines contrastive learning and a denoising autoencoder. To evaluate the performance of med-gte-hybrid, we investigate several clinical prediction tasks in large patient cohorts extracted from the MIMIC-IV dataset, including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patient prognosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) prediction, and patient mortality prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the med-gte-hybrid model improves patient stratification, clustering, and text retrieval, thus outperforms current state-of-the-art models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While some of our evaluations focus on CKD, our hybrid tuning of sentence transformers could be transferred to other medical domains and has the potential to improve clinical decision-making and personalised treatment pathways in various healthcare applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16002">KVLink: Accelerating Large Language Models via Efficient KV Cache Reuse</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Yang, Bairu Hou, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao, Shiyu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation of LLMs when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces three key components: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents, and applying mixed-data fine-tuning to enhance performance while preserving the model's original capabilities. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 90% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Won Seok Jang, Sharmin Sultana, Zonghai Yao, Hieu Tran, Zhichao Yang, Sunjae Kwon, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: OpenNotes enables patients to access EHR notes, but medical jargon can hinder comprehension. To improve understanding, we evaluated closed- and open-source LLMs for extracting and prioritizing key medical terms using prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation.
  Materials and Methods: We assessed LLMs on 106 expert-annotated EHR notes, experimenting with (i) general vs. structured prompts, (ii) zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting, (iii) fine-tuning, and (iv) data augmentation. To enhance open-source models in low-resource settings, we used ChatGPT for data augmentation and applied ranking techniques. We incrementally increased the augmented dataset size (10 to 10,000) and conducted 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1 score and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).
  Results and Discussion: Fine-tuning and data augmentation improved performance over other strategies. GPT-4 Turbo achieved the highest F1 (0.433), while Mistral7B with data augmentation had the highest MRR (0.746). Open-source models, when fine-tuned or augmented, outperformed closed-source models. Notably, the best F1 and MRR scores did not always align. Few-shot prompting outperformed zero-shot in vanilla models, and structured prompts yielded different preferences across models. Fine-tuning improved zero-shot performance but sometimes degraded few-shot performance. Data augmentation performed comparably or better than other methods.
  Conclusion: Our evaluation highlights the effectiveness of prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation in improving model performance for medical jargon extraction in low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current medical language model (LM) benchmarks often over-simplify the complexities of day-to-day clinical practice tasks and instead rely on evaluating LMs on multiple-choice board exam questions. Thus, we present an expert-created and annotated dataset spanning five critical domains of decision-making in mental healthcare: treatment, diagnosis, documentation, monitoring, and triage. This dataset - created without any LM assistance - is designed to capture the nuanced clinical reasoning and daily ambiguities mental health practitioners encounter, reflecting the inherent complexities of care delivery that are missing from existing datasets. Almost all 203 base questions with five answer options each have had the decision-irrelevant demographic patient information removed and replaced with variables (e.g., AGE), and are available for male, female, or non-binary-coded patients. For question categories dealing with ambiguity and multiple valid answer options, we create a preference dataset with uncertainties from the expert annotations. We outline a series of intended use cases and demonstrate the usability of our dataset by evaluating eleven off-the-shelf and four mental health fine-tuned LMs on category-specific task accuracy, on the impact of patient demographic information on decision-making, and how consistently free-form responses deviate from human annotated samples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable performance in domains such as mathematics, programming, and literary creation. However, most studies have focused on semantic memory-based question answering, neglecting LLMs' potential to handle episodic memory (EM)-related queries. This oversight has led to suboptimal performance in applications requiring EM, including emotional companionship, personal AI assistants, and AI teachers. To address this gap, we introduce Echo, a LLM enhanced with temporal episodic memory. We propose a Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework that guides the model in generating multi-turn, complex scenario episodic memory dialogue data (EM-Train). Temporal information is innovatively incorporated into the LLM training process, and Echo is trained using the EM-Train. Furthermore, We develop an EM-Test benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' episodic memory capabilities. The EM-Test assesses performance across various time spans and difficulty levels, providing a comprehensive evaluation of multi-turn episodic memory dialogues. Our experiments demonstrate that Echo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on EM-Test. Additionally, a qualitative analysis reveals Echo's potential to exhibit human-like episodic memory capabilities. We will open-source all datasets, code, and model weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Li, Peiyi Wang, Jingyuan Ma, Di Zhang, Lei Sha, Zhifang Sui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention for their remarkable capacity, alongside concerns about safety arising from their potential to produce harmful content. Red teaming aims to find prompts that could elicit harmful responses from LLMs, and is essential to discover and mitigate safety risks before real-world deployment. However, manual red teaming is both time-consuming and expensive, rendering it unscalable. In this paper, we propose RTPE, a scalable evolution framework to evolve red teaming prompts across both breadth and depth dimensions, facilitating the automatic generation of numerous high-quality and diverse red teaming prompts. Specifically, in-breadth evolving employs a novel enhanced in-context learning method to create a multitude of quality prompts, whereas in-depth evolving applies customized transformation operations to enhance both content and form of prompts, thereby increasing diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RTPE surpasses existing representative automatic red teaming methods on both attack success rate and diversity. In addition, based on 4,800 red teaming prompts created by RTPE, we further provide a systematic analysis of 8 representative LLMs across 8 sensitive topics.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate the integration of a large language model (LLM) with an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, specifically focusing on enhancing rare word recognition performance. Using a 190,000-hour dataset primarily sourced from YouTube, pre-processed with Whisper V3 pseudo-labeling, we demonstrate that the LLM-ASR architecture outperforms traditional Zipformer-Transducer models in the zero-shot rare word recognition task, after training on a large dataset. Our analysis reveals that the LLM contributes significantly to improvements in rare word error rate (R-WER), while the speech encoder primarily determines overall transcription performance (Orthographic Word Error Rate, O-WER, and Normalized Word Error Rate, N-WER). Through extensive ablation studies, we highlight the importance of adapter integration in aligning speech encoder outputs with the LLM's linguistic capabilities. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical role of high-quality labeled data in achieving optimal performance. These findings provide valuable insights into the synergy between LLM-based ASR architectures, paving the way for future advancements in large-scale LLM-based speech recognition systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Zhang, Sha Li, Cheng Qian, Jiateng Liu, Pengfei Yu, Chi Han, Yi R. Fung, Kathleen McKeown, Chengxiang Zhai, Manling Li, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent challenge in large language models (LLMs), where even with rigorous quality control, models often generate distorted facts. This paradox, in which error generation continues despite high-quality training data, calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying LLM mechanisms. To address it, we propose a novel concept: knowledge overshadowing, where model's dominant knowledge can obscure less prominent knowledge during text generation, causing the model to fabricate inaccurate details. Building on this idea, we introduce a novel framework to quantify factual hallucinations by modeling knowledge overshadowing. Central to our approach is the log-linear law, which predicts that the rate of factual hallucination increases linearly with the logarithmic scale of (1) Knowledge Popularity, (2) Knowledge Length, and (3) Model Size. The law provides a means to preemptively quantify hallucinations, offering foresight into their occurrence even before model training or inference. Built on overshadowing effect, we propose a new decoding strategy CoDa, to mitigate hallucinations, which notably enhance model factuality on Overshadow (27.9%), MemoTrap (13.1%) and NQ-Swap (18.3%). Our findings not only deepen understandings of the underlying mechanisms behind hallucinations but also provide actionable insights for developing more predictable and controllable language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans are believed to perceive numbers on a logarithmic mental number line, where smaller values are represented with greater resolution than larger ones. This cognitive bias, supported by neuroscience and behavioral studies, suggests that numerical magnitudes are processed in a sublinear fashion rather than on a uniform linear scale. Inspired by this hypothesis, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a similar logarithmic-like structure in their internal numerical representations. By analyzing how numerical values are encoded across different layers of LLMs, we apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and PLS followed by geometric regression to uncover latent structures in the learned embeddings. Our findings reveal that the model's numerical representations exhibit sublinear spacing, with distances between values aligning with a logarithmic scale. This suggests that LLMs, much like humans, may encode numbers in a compressed, non-uniform manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Long, Liansheng Zhuang, Aodi Li, Minghong Yao, Shafei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the remarkable reasoning ability, Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) tasks, which find answers to natural language questions over knowledge graphs (KGs). To alleviate the hallucinations and lack of knowledge issues of LLMs, existing methods often retrieve the question-related information from KGs to enrich the input context. However, most methods focus on retrieving the relevant information while ignoring the importance of different types of knowledge in reasoning, which degrades their performance. To this end, this paper reformulates the KGQA problem as a graphical model and proposes a three-stage framework named the Evidence Path Enhanced Reasoning Model (EPERM) for KGQA. In the first stage, EPERM uses the fine-tuned LLM to retrieve a subgraph related to the question from the original knowledge graph. In the second stage, EPERM filters out the evidence paths that faithfully support the reasoning of the questions, and score their importance in reasoning. Finally, EPERM uses the weighted evidence paths to reason the final answer. Since considering the importance of different structural information in KGs for reasoning, EPERM can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs in KGQA tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that EPERM achieves superior performances in KGQA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Momose Oyama, Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Yusuke Takase, Hidetoshi Shimodaira</p>
<p>Abstract: To compare autoregressive language models at scale, we propose using log-likelihood vectors computed on a predefined text set as model features. This approach has a solid theoretical basis: when treated as model coordinates, their squared Euclidean distance approximates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of text-generation probabilities. Our method is highly scalable, with computational cost growing linearly in both the number of models and text samples, and is easy to implement as the required features are derived from cross-entropy loss. Applying this method to over 1,000 language models, we constructed a "model map," providing a new perspective on large-scale model analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewan Kwon, Sangyong Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: There are two main approaches to recent extractive summarization: the sentence-level framework, which selects sentences to include in a summary individually, and the summary-level framework, which generates multiple candidate summaries and ranks them. Previous work in both frameworks has primarily focused on improving which sentences in a document should be included in the summary. However, the sentence order of extractive summaries, which is critical for the quality of a summary, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce OrderSum, a novel extractive summarization model that semantically orders sentences within an extractive summary. OrderSum proposes a new representation method to incorporate the sentence order into the embedding of the extractive summary, and an objective function to train the model to identify which extractive summary has a better sentence order in the semantic space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OrderSum obtains state-of-the-art performance in both sentence inclusion and sentence order for extractive summarization. In particular, OrderSum achieves a ROUGE-L score of 30.52 on CNN/DailyMail, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin of 2.54.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Liu, Hongda Sun, Wenya Guo, Xinyan Xiao, Cunli Mao, Zhengtao Yu, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex claim fact-checking performs a crucial role in disinformation detection. However, existing fact-checking methods struggle with claim vagueness, specifically in effectively handling latent information and complex relations within claims. Moreover, evidence redundancy, where nonessential information complicates the verification process, remains a significant issue. To tackle these limitations, we propose Bilateral Defusing Verification (BiDeV), a novel fact-checking working-flow framework integrating multiple role-played LLMs to mimic the human-expert fact-checking process. BiDeV consists of two main modules: Vagueness Defusing identifies latent information and resolves complex relations to simplify the claim, and Redundancy Defusing eliminates redundant content to enhance the evidence quality. Extensive experimental results on two widely used challenging fact-checking benchmarks (Hover and Feverous-s) demonstrate that our BiDeV can achieve the best performance under both gold and open settings. This highlights the effectiveness of BiDeV in handling complex claims and ensuring precise fact-checking</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivank Garg, Ayush Singh, Shweta Singh, Paras Chopra</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. While it enables LLMs to achieve human-level alignment, it often incurs significant computational and financial costs due to its reliance on training external reward models or human-labeled preferences. In this work, we propose \textbf{Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO)}, an alternative approach that leverages generative LLMs as preference classifiers, thereby reducing the dependence on external human feedback or reward models to obtain preferences. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes, architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a preference classifier for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based training. Our findings demonstrate that models trained through IPO achieve performance comparable to those utilizing state-of-the-art reward models for obtaining preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maarten Bosten, Bennett Kleinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing research is increasingly reliant on large scale data and computational power. Many achievements in the past decade resulted from collaborations with the tech industry. But an increasing entanglement of academic research and industry interests leads to conflicts of interest. We assessed published NLP research from 2000-2024 and labeled author affiliations as academic or industry-affiliated to measure conflicts of interest. Overall 27.65% of the papers contained at least one industry-affiliated author. That figure increased substantially with more than 1 in 3 papers having a conflict of interest in 2024. We identify top-tier venues (ACL, EMNLP) as main drivers for that effect. The paper closes with a discussion and a simple, concrete suggestion for the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shulin Huang, Linyi Yang, Yan Song, Shuang Chen, Leyang Cui, Ziyu Wan, Qingcheng Zeng, Ying Wen, Kun Shao, Weinan Zhang, Jun Wang, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges, particularly due to issues of data contamination and the leakage of correct answers. To address these challenges, we introduce ThinkBench, a novel evaluation framework designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning capability robustly. ThinkBench proposes a dynamic data generation method for constructing out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets and offers an OOD dataset that contains 2,912 samples drawn from reasoning tasks. ThinkBench unifies the evaluation of reasoning models and non-reasoning models. We evaluate 16 LLMs and 4 PRMs under identical experimental conditions and show that most of the LLMs' performance are far from robust and they face a certain level of data leakage. By dynamically generating OOD datasets, ThinkBench effectively provides a reliable evaluation of LLMs and reduces the impact of data contamination.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Qwen 2.5 3B base model was fine-tuned to generate contextually rich and engaging movie dialogue, leveraging the Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus, a curated dataset of movie conversations. Due to the limitations in GPU computing and VRAM, the training process began with the 0.5B model progressively scaling up to the 1.5B and 3B versions as efficiency improvements were implemented. The Qwen 2.5 series, developed by Alibaba Group, stands at the forefront of small open-source pre-trained models, particularly excelling in creative tasks compared to alternatives like Meta's Llama 3.2 and Google's Gemma. Results demonstrate the ability of small models to produce high-quality, realistic dialogue, offering a promising approach for real-time, context-sensitive conversation generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartik Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an iterative approach to performing Scientific Named Entity Recognition (SciNER) using BERT-based models. We leverage transfer learning to fine-tune pretrained models with a small but high-quality set of manually annotated data. The process is iteratively refined by using the fine-tuned model to auto-annotate a larger dataset, followed by additional rounds of fine-tuning. We evaluated two models, dslim/bert-large-NER and bert-largecased, and found that bert-large-cased consistently outperformed the former. Our approach demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy and F1 scores, especially for less common entity classes. Future work could include pertaining with unlabeled data, exploring more powerful encoders like RoBERTa, and expanding the scope of manual annotations. This methodology has broader applications in NLP tasks where access to labeled data is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beatriz Canaverde, Telmo Pessoa Pires, Leonor Melo Ribeiro, Andr\'e F. T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent application of LLMs to the legal field has spurred the creation of benchmarks across various jurisdictions and languages. However, no benchmark has yet been specifically designed for the Portuguese legal system. In this work, we present LegalBench.PT, the first comprehensive legal benchmark covering key areas of Portuguese law. To develop LegalBench.PT, we first collect long-form questions and answers from real law exams, and then use GPT-4o to convert them into multiple-choice, true/false, and matching formats. Once generated, the questions are filtered and processed to improve the quality of the dataset. To ensure accuracy and relevance, we validate our approach by having a legal professional review a sample of the generated questions. Although the questions are synthetically generated, we show that their basis in human-created exams and our rigorous filtering and processing methods applied result in a reliable benchmark for assessing LLMs' legal knowledge and reasoning abilities. Finally, we evaluate the performance of leading LLMs on LegalBench.PT and investigate potential biases in GPT-4o's responses. We also assess the performance of Portuguese lawyers on a sample of questions to establish a baseline for model comparison and validate the benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamshid Mozafari, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Bhawna Piryani, Adam Jatowt</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing information retrieval, with chatbots becoming an important source for answering user queries. As by their design, LLMs prioritize generating correct answers, the value of highly plausible yet incorrect answers (candidate answers) tends to be overlooked. However, such answers can still prove useful, for example, they can play a crucial role in tasks like Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and QA Robustness Assessment (QARA). Existing QA datasets primarily focus on correct answers without explicit consideration of the plausibility of other candidate answers, limiting opportunity for more nuanced evaluations of models. To address this gap, we introduce PlausibleQA, a large-scale dataset comprising 10,000 questions and 100,000 candidate answers, each annotated with plausibility scores and justifications for their selection. Additionally, the dataset includes 900,000 justifications for pairwise comparisons between candidate answers, further refining plausibility assessments. We evaluate PlausibleQA through human assessments and empirical experiments, demonstrating its utility in MCQA and QARA analysis. Our findings show that plausibility-aware approaches are effective for MCQA distractor generation and QARA. We release PlausibleQA as a resource for advancing QA research and enhancing LLM performance in distinguishing plausible distractors from correct answers.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16366">A generative approach to LLM harmfulness detection with special red flag tokens</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophie Xhonneux, David Dobre, Mehrnaz Mohfakhami, Leo Schwinn, Gauthier Gidel</p>
<p>Abstract: Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of Computer science (CS) has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, providing computational tools and methodologies to various fields and forming new interdisciplinary communities. This growth in CS has significantly impacted institutional practices and relevant research communities. Therefore, it is crucial to explore what specific \textbf{research values}, known as \textbf{basic and fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate research attitudes or actions}, CS-related research communities promote. Prior research has manually analyzed research values from a small sample of machine learning papers \cite{facct}. No prior work has studied the automatic detection of research values in CS from large-scale scientific texts across different research subfields. This paper introduces a detailed annotation scheme featuring \textbf{ten research values} that guide CS-related research. Based on the scheme, we build value classifiers to scale up the analysis and present a systematic study over 226,600 paper abstracts from 32 CS-related subfields and 86 popular publishing venues over ten years.</p>

<p>Abstract: The next token prediction loss is the dominant self-supervised training objective for large language models and has achieved promising results in a variety of downstream tasks. However, upon closer investigation of this objective, we find that it lacks an understanding of sequence-level signals, leading to a mismatch between training and inference processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a contrastive preference optimization (CPO) procedure that can inject sequence-level information into the language model at any training stage without expensive human labeled data. Our experiments show that the proposed objective surpasses the next token prediction in terms of win rate in the instruction-following and text generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: By connecting disparate sources of scientific literature, literature\-/based discovery (LBD) methods help to uncover new knowledge and generate new research hypotheses that cannot be found from domain-specific documents alone. Our work focuses on bisociative LBD methods that combine bisociative reasoning with LBD techniques. The paper presents LBD through the lens of reproducible science to ensure the reproducibility of LBD experiments, overcome the inconsistent use of benchmark datasets and methods, trigger collaboration, and advance the LBD field toward more robust and impactful scientific discoveries. The main novelty of this study is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate the steps of the bisociative LBD process, including data acquisition, text preprocessing, hypothesis formulation, and evaluation. The contributed notebooks implement a selection of traditional LBD approaches, as well as our own ensemble-based, outlier-based, and link prediction-based approaches. The reader can benefit from hands-on experience with LBD through open access to benchmark datasets, code reuse, and a ready-to-run Docker recipe that ensures reproducibility of the selected LBD methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used for the inverse design of materials, such as crystals and molecules. Existing AI research on molecules has integrated chemical structures of molecules with textual knowledge to adapt to complex instructions. However, this approach has been unattainable for crystals due to data scarcity from the biased distribution of investigated crystals and the lack of semantic supervision in peer-reviewed literature. In this work, we introduce a contrastive language-crystals model (CLaC) pre-trained on a newly synthesized dataset of 126k crystal structure-text pairs. To demonstrate the advantage of using synthetic data to overcome data scarcity, we constructed a comparable dataset extracted from academic papers. We evaluate CLaC's generalization ability through various zero-shot cross-modal tasks and downstream applications. In experiments, CLaC achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization performance in understanding crystal structures, surpassing latest large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxuan Liao, Binrong Zhu, Jacky He, Guiran Liu, Hongye Zheng, Jia Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of deep learning technology, large language models have achieved remarkable results in many natural language processing tasks. However, these models still have certain limitations in handling complex reasoning tasks and understanding rich background knowledge. To solve this problem, this study proposed a T5 model fine-tuning method based on knowledge graphs, which enhances the model's reasoning ability and context understanding ability by introducing external knowledge graphs. We used the SQuAD1.1 dataset for experiments. The experimental results show that the T5 model based on knowledge graphs is significantly better than other baseline models in reasoning accuracy, context understanding, and the ability to handle complex problems. At the same time, we also explored the impact of knowledge graphs of different scales on model performance and found that as the scale of the knowledge graph increases, the performance of the model gradually improves. Especially when dealing with complex problems, the introduction of knowledge graphs greatly improves the reasoning ability of the T5 model. Ablation experiments further verify the importance of entity and relationship embedding in the model and prove that a complete knowledge graph is crucial to improving the various capabilities of the T5 model. In summary, this study provides an effective method to enhance the reasoning and understanding capabilities of large language models and provides new directions for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science. Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the $50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are inadequate at catching deliberately plagiarized ideas from an LLM. We recommend a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of our findings on research and academic publishing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyi Huang, Runzhe Zhan, Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao, Ailin Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced various industries but suffer from a critical flaw, the potential sensitivity of generating harmful content, which poses severe societal risks. We developed and tested novel attack strategies on popular LLMs to expose their vulnerabilities in generating inappropriate content. These strategies, inspired by psychological phenomena such as the "Priming Effect", "Safe Attention Shift", and "Cognitive Dissonance", effectively attack the models' guarding mechanisms. Our experiments achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 100% on various open-source models, including Meta's Llama-3.2, Google's Gemma-2, Mistral's Mistral-NeMo, Falcon's Falcon-mamba, Apple's DCLM, Microsoft's Phi3, and Qwen's Qwen2.5, among others. Similarly, for closed-source models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, Google's Gemini-1.5, and Claude-3.5, we observed an ASR of at least 95% on the AdvBench dataset, which represents the current state-of-the-art. This study underscores the urgent need to reassess the use of generative models in critical applications to mitigate potential adverse societal impacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Zheng, Sha Li, Fangkun Wu, Yang Ziyi, Lin Hongchao, Zhichao Hu, Cai Xinjun, Ziming Wang, Jinxuan Chen, Sitao Luan, Jiahao Xu, Lihui Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Parody is an emerging phenomenon on social media, where individuals imitate a role or position opposite to their own, often for humor, provocation, or controversy. Detecting and analyzing parody can be challenging and is often reliant on context, yet it plays a crucial role in understanding cultural values, promoting subcultures, and enhancing self-expression. However, the study of parody is hindered by limited available data and deficient diversity in current datasets. To bridge this gap, we built seven parody datasets from both English and Chinese corpora, with 14,755 annotated users and 21,210 annotated comments in total. To provide sufficient context information, we also collect replies and construct user-interaction graphs to provide richer contextual information, which is lacking in existing datasets. With these datasets, we test traditional methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) on three key tasks: (1) parody detection, (2) comment sentiment analysis with parody, and (3) user sentiment analysis with parody. Our extensive experiments reveal that parody-related tasks still remain challenging for all models, and contextual information plays a critical role. Interestingly, we find that, in certain scenarios, traditional sentence embedding methods combined with simple classifiers can outperform advanced LLMs, i.e. DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o3, highlighting parody as a significant challenge for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingjian Chen, Haoran Liu, Yinhong Liu, Rui Yang, Han Yuan, Yanran Fu, Pengyuan Zhou, Qingyu Chen, James Caverlee, Irene Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used, but they often generate subtle factual errors, especially in long-form text. These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{GraphCheck}}, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains which are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate a 6.1\% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Wu, Viktor Schlegel, Riza Batista-Navarro</p>
<p>Abstract: As neural language models achieve human-comparable performance on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and see widespread adoption, ensuring their robustness in real-world scenarios has become increasingly important. Current robustness evaluation research, though, primarily develops synthetic perturbation methods, leaving unclear how well they reflect real life scenarios. Considering this, we present a framework to automatically examine MRC models on naturally occurring textual perturbations, by replacing paragraph in MRC benchmarks with their counterparts based on available Wikipedia edit history. Such perturbation type is natural as its design does not stem from an arteficial generative process, inherently distinct from the previously investigated synthetic approaches. In a large-scale study encompassing SQUAD datasets and various model architectures we observe that natural perturbations result in performance degradation in pre-trained encoder language models. More worryingly, these state-of-the-art Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit these errors. Further experiments demonstrate that our findings generalise to natural perturbations found in other more challenging MRC benchmarks. In an effort to mitigate these errors, we show that it is possible to improve the robustness to natural perturbations by training on naturally or synthetically perturbed examples, though a noticeable gap still remains compared to performance on unperturbed data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deokhyung Kang, Jeonghun Cho, Yejin Jeon, Sunbin Jang, Minsub Lee, Jawoon Cho, Gary Geunbae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Rystr{\o}m, Hannah Rose Kirk, Scott Hale</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16540">Advanced Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Parameter Extraction from Documents Using Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Cai Chen, Yi Pin Xu, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting parameters from technical documentation is crucial for ensuring design precision and simulation reliability in electronic design. However, current methods struggle to handle high-dimensional design data and meet the demands of real-time processing. In electronic design automation (EDA), engineers often manually search through extensive documents to retrieve component parameters required for constructing PySpice models, a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the extraction of parameters and the generation of PySpice models directly from datasheets. Our framework introduces three Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based techniques: (1) Targeted Document Retrieval (TDR), which enables the rapid identification of relevant technical sections; (2) Iterative Retrieval Optimization (IRO), which refines the parameter search through iterative improvements; and (3) Preference Optimization (PO), which dynamically prioritizes key document sections based on relevance. Experimental results show that applying all three methods together improves retrieval precision by 47.69% and reduces processing latency by 37.84%. Furthermore, effect size analysis using Cohen's d reveals that PO significantly reduces latency, while IRO contributes most to precision enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of our framework to streamline EDA processes, enhance design accuracy, and shorten development timelines. Additionally, our algorithm has model-agnostic generalization, meaning it can improve parameter search performance across different LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maram Hasanain, Md Arid Hasan, Mohamed Bayan Kmainasi, Elisa Sartori, Ali Ezzat Shahroor, Giovanni Da San Martino, Firoj Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been significant research on propagandistic content detection across different modalities and languages. However, most studies have primarily focused on detection, with little attention given to explanations justifying the predicted label. This is largely due to the lack of resources that provide explanations alongside annotated labels. To address this issue, we propose a multilingual (i.e., Arabic and English) explanation-enhanced dataset, the first of its kind. Additionally, we introduce an explanation-enhanced LLM for both label detection and rationale-based explanation generation. Our findings indicate that the model performs comparably while also generating explanations. We will make the dataset and experimental resources publicly available for the research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Kuzmanko</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform when tackling quantitative management decision problems in a zero-shot setting. Drawing on 900 responses generated by five leading models across 20 diverse managerial scenarios, our analysis explores whether these base models can deliver accurate numerical decisions under varying presentation formats, scenario complexities, and repeated attempts. Contrary to prior findings, we observed no significant effects of text presentation format (direct, narrative, or tabular) or text length on accuracy. However, scenario complexity -- particularly in terms of constraints and irrelevant parameters -- strongly influenced performance, often degrading accuracy. Surprisingly, the models handled tasks requiring multiple solution steps more effectively than expected. Notably, only 28.8\% of responses were exactly correct, highlighting limitations in precision. We further found no significant ``learning effect'' across iterations: performance remained stable across repeated queries. Nonetheless, significant variations emerged among the five tested LLMs, with some showing superior binary accuracy. Overall, these findings underscore both the promise and the pitfalls of harnessing LLMs for complex quantitative decision-making, informing managers and researchers about optimal deployment strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangliang Liu, Lei Jiang, Xitong Zhang, Kristen Marie Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) return just responses which adhere to societal values is crucial for their broader application. Prior research has shown that LLMs often fail to perform satisfactorily on tasks requiring moral cognizance, such as ethics-based judgments. While current approaches have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with curated datasets to improve their capabilities on such tasks, choosing the optimal learning paradigm to enhance the ethical responses of LLMs remains an open research debate. In this work, we aim to address this fundamental question: can current learning paradigms enable LLMs to acquire sufficient moral reasoning capabilities? Drawing from distributional semantics theory and the pragmatic nature of moral discourse, our analysis indicates that performance improvements follow a mechanism similar to that of semantic-level tasks, and therefore remain affected by the pragmatic nature of morals latent in discourse, a phenomenon we name the pragmatic dilemma. We conclude that this pragmatic dilemma imposes significant limitations on the generalization ability of current learning paradigms, making it the primary bottleneck for moral reasoning acquisition in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal content on social media presents significant challenges in understanding and moderating complex, context-dependent issues such as misinformation, hate speech, and propaganda. While efforts have been made to develop resources and propose new methods for automatic detection, limited attention has been given to label detection and the generation of explanation-based rationales for predicted labels. To address this challenge, we introduce MemeIntel, an explanation-enhanced dataset for propaganda memes in Arabic and hateful memes in English, making it the first large-scale resource for these tasks. To solve these tasks, we propose a multi-stage optimization approach and train Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves performance over the base model for both \textbf{label detection} and explanation generation, outperforming the current state-of-the-art with an absolute improvement of ~3% on ArMeme and ~7% on Hateful Memes. For reproducibility and future research, we aim to make the MemeIntel dataset and experimental resources publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The critique capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for reasoning abilities, which can provide necessary suggestions (e.g., detailed analysis and constructive feedback). Therefore, how to evaluate the critique capacity of LLMs has drawn great attention and several critique benchmarks have been proposed. However, existing critique benchmarks usually have the following limitations: (1). Focusing on diverse reasoning tasks in general domains and insufficient evaluation on code tasks (e.g., only covering code generation task), where the difficulty of queries is relatively easy (e.g., the code queries of CriticBench are from Humaneval and MBPP). (2). Lacking comprehensive evaluation from different dimensions. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic code critique benchmark for LLMs called CodeCriticBench. Specifically, our CodeCriticBench includes two mainstream code tasks (i.e., code generation and code QA) with different difficulties. Besides, the evaluation protocols include basic critique evaluation and advanced critique evaluation for different characteristics, where fine-grained evaluation checklists are well-designed for advanced settings. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental results of existing LLMs, which show the effectiveness of CodeCriticBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular approach for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing their limitations in verifying facts and answering knowledge-intensive questions. As the research in LLM extends their capability to handle input modality other than text, e.g. image, several multimodal RAG benchmarks are proposed. Nonetheless, they mainly use textual knowledge bases as the primary source of evidences for augmentation. There still lack benchmarks designed to evaluate images as augmentation in RAG systems and how they leverage visual knowledge. We propose Visual-RAG, a novel Question Answering benchmark that emphasizes visual knowledge intensive questions. Unlike prior works relying on text-based evidence, Visual-RAG necessitates text-to-image retrieval and integration of relevant clue images to extract visual knowledge as evidence. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-sourced and 3 proprietary Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), revealing that images can serve as good evidence in RAG; however, even the SoTA models struggle with effectively extracting and utilizing visual knowledge</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlong Wang, Zhaoyang Chu, Zhengxiang Cheng, Xuyi Yang, Kaiyue Qiu, Yao Wan, Zhou Zhao, Xuanhua Shi, Dongping Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance in software engineering yet face challenges in adapting to continually evolving code knowledge, particularly regarding the frequent updates of third-party library APIs. This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets, often results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety and efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for identifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge updates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop CODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay synchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs from six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three evaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of 2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of advanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe that our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more effective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future.

<p>Abstract: Socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important as AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities. However, current works in artificial social reasoning all rely on language-only, or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel source of data rich in nonverbal and social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting non-verbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 221 videos from YouTube, through rigorous annotation and verification, resulting in a benchmark with 101 videos and 806 question-answer pairs. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that their overall accuracy ranges from 15-30%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. Our data resources are released at https://github.com/MIT-MI/MimeQA to inspire future work in foundation models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can we improve machine translation (MT) with LLMs by rewriting their inputs automatically? Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is easier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text in many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily exploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of 21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English into 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective MT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using quality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms that simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT. These results suggest LLM-assisted input rewriting as a promising direction for improving translations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable tasks requiring extensive information integration but are limited by the scarcity of high-quality, diverse datasets for long-context instruction tuning. Existing data synthesis methods focus narrowly on objectives like fact retrieval and summarization, restricting their generalizability to complex, real-world tasks. WildLong extracts meta-information from real user queries, models co-occurrence relationships via graph-based methods, and employs adaptive generation to produce scalable data. It extends beyond single-document tasks to support multi-document reasoning, such as cross-document comparison and aggregation. Our models, finetuned on 150K instruction-response pairs synthesized using WildLong, surpasses existing open-source long-context-optimized models across benchmarks while maintaining strong performance on short-context tasks without incorporating supplementary short-context data. By generating a more diverse and realistic long-context instruction dataset, WildLong enhances LLMs' ability to generalize to complex, real-world reasoning over long contexts, establishing a new paradigm for long-context data synthesis.</p>

However, responsible AI (RAI), which aims to ensure safe responses, remains underexplored in the context of FedLLM. In FedLLM, client data used for training may contain harmful content, leading to unsafe LLMs that generate harmful responses. Aggregating such unsafe LLMs into the global model and distributing them to clients may result in the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. To address this issue, we incorporate two well-known RAI methods into FedLLM: the safety filter and constitutional AI. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods significantly enhance the safety of the LLM, achieving over a 20% improvement on AdvBench, a benchmark for evaluating safety performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Makharev, Vladimir Ivanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Code summarization is a critical task in natural language processing and software engineering, which aims to generate concise descriptions of source code. Recent advancements have improved the quality of these summaries, enhancing code readability and maintainability. However, the content of a repository or a class has not been considered in function code summarization. This study investigated the effectiveness of code summarization models beyond the function level, exploring the impact of class and repository contexts on the summary quality. The study involved revising benchmarks for evaluating models at class and repository levels, assessing baseline models, and evaluating LLMs with in-context learning to determine the enhancement of summary quality with additional context. The findings revealed that the fine-tuned state-of-the-art CodeT5+ base model excelled in code summarization, while incorporating few-shot learning and retrieved code chunks from RAG significantly enhanced the performance of LLMs in this task. Notably, the Deepseek Coder 1.3B and Starcoder2 15B models demonstrated substantial improvements in metrics such as BLEURT, METEOR, and BLEU-4 at both class and repository levels. Repository-level summarization exhibited promising potential but necessitates significant computational resources and gains from the inclusion of structured context. Lastly, we employed the recent SIDE code summarization metric in our evaluation. This study contributes to refining strategies for prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and RAG, addressing gaps in benchmarks for code summarization at various levels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Miller, Kumar Shridhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly when prompted to generate intermediate explanations. However, it remains an open question whether these intermediate reasoning traces represent a dynamic, evolving thought process or merely reflect sophisticated pattern recognition acquired during large scale pre training. Drawing inspiration from human cognition, where reasoning unfolds incrementally as new information is assimilated and internal models are continuously updated, we propose to delve deeper into the mental model of various LMs. We propose a new way to assess the mental modeling of LMs, where they are provided with problem details gradually, allowing each new piece of data to build upon and refine the model's internal representation of the task. We systematically compare this step by step mental modeling strategy with traditional full prompt methods across both text only and vision and text modalities. Experiments on the MathWorld dataset across different model sizes and problem complexities confirm that both text-based LLMs and multimodal LMs struggle to create mental representations, questioning how their internal cognitive processes work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suneel Nadipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained transformers is a powerful technique for enhancing the performance of base models on specific tasks. From early applications in models like BERT to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), this approach has been instrumental in adapting general-purpose architectures for specialized downstream tasks. Understanding the fine-tuning process is crucial for uncovering how transformers adapt to specific objectives, retain general representations, and acquire task-specific features. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of fine-tuning, specifically in the BERT transformer, by analyzing activation similarity, training Sparse AutoEncoders (SAEs), and visualizing token-level activations across different layers. Based on experiments conducted across multiple datasets and BERT layers, we observe a steady progression in how features adapt to the task at hand: early layers primarily retain general representations, middle layers act as a transition between general and task-specific features, and later layers fully specialize in task adaptation. These findings provide key insights into the inner workings of fine-tuning and its impact on representation learning within transformer architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Quoc Nguyen, Cong Duy Vu Hoang, Duy Vu, Gioacchino Tangari, Thanh Tien Vu, Don Dharmasiri, Yuan-Fang Li, Long Duong</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance in the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task. However, their effectiveness diminishes when dealing with large database schemas, as the context length increases. To address this limitation, we present SQLong, a novel and efficient data augmentation framework designed to enhance LLM performance in long-context scenarios for the NL2SQL task. SQLong generates augmented datasets by extending existing database schemas with additional synthetic CREATE TABLE commands and corresponding data rows, sampled from diverse schemas in the training data. This approach effectively simulates long-context scenarios during finetuning and evaluation. Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets. These imply SQLong's practical implementation and its impact on improving NL2SQL capabilities in real-world settings with complex database schemas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinu Lee, Qi Liu, Runzhi Ma, Vincent Han, Ziqi Wang, Heng Ji, Julia Hockenmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: First-order logic (FOL) can represent the logical entailment semantics of natural language (NL) sentences, but determining natural language entailment using FOL remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the Entailment-Preserving FOL representations (EPF) task and introduce reference-free evaluation metrics for EPF, the Entailment-Preserving Rate (EPR) family. In EPF, one should generate FOL representations from multi-premise natural language entailment data (e.g. EntailmentBank) so that the automatic prover's result preserves the entailment labels. Experiments show that existing methods for NL-to-FOL translation struggle in EPF. To this extent, we propose a training method specialized for the task, iterative learning-to-rank, which directly optimizes the model's EPR score through a novel scoring function and a learning-to-rank objective. Our method achieves a 1.8-2.7% improvement in EPR and a 17.4-20.6% increase in EPR@16 compared to diverse baselines in three datasets. Further analyses reveal that iterative learning-to-rank effectively suppresses the arbitrariness of FOL representation by reducing the diversity of predicate signatures, and maintains strong performance across diverse inference types and out-of-domain data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Suh, Erfan Jahanparast, Suhong Moon, Minwoo Kang, Serina Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present novel opportunities in public opinion research by predicting survey responses in advance during the early stages of survey design. Prior methods steer LLMs via descriptions of subpopulations as LLMs' input prompt, yet such prompt engineering approaches have struggled to faithfully predict the distribution of survey responses from human subjects. In this work, we propose directly fine-tuning LLMs to predict response distributions by leveraging unique structural characteristics of survey data. To enable fine-tuning, we curate SubPOP, a significantly scaled dataset of 3,362 questions and 70K subpopulation-response pairs from well-established public opinion surveys. We show that fine-tuning on SubPOP greatly improves the match between LLM predictions and human responses across various subpopulations, reducing the LLM-human gap by up to 46% compared to baselines, and achieves strong generalization to unseen surveys and subpopulations. Our findings highlight the potential of survey-based fine-tuning to improve opinion prediction for diverse, real-world subpopulations and therefore enable more efficient survey designs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simeng Han, Frank Palma Gomez, Tu Vu, Zefei Li, Daniel Cer, Hansi Zeng, Chris Tar, Arman Cohan, Gustavo Hernandez Abrego</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional text embedding benchmarks primarily evaluate embedding models' capabilities to capture semantic similarity. However, more advanced NLP tasks require a deeper understanding of text, such as safety and factuality. These tasks demand an ability to comprehend and process complex information, often involving the handling of sensitive content, or the verification of factual statements against reliable sources. We introduce a new benchmark designed to assess and highlight the limitations of embedding models trained on existing information retrieval data mixtures on advanced capabilities, which include factuality, safety, instruction following, reasoning and document-level understanding. This benchmark includes a diverse set of tasks that simulate real-world scenarios where these capabilities are critical and leads to identification of the gaps of the currently advanced embedding models. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that reformulates these various tasks as retrieval tasks. By framing tasks like safety or factuality classification as retrieval problems, we leverage the strengths of retrieval models in capturing semantic relationships while also pushing them to develop a deeper understanding of context and content. Using this approach with single-task fine-tuning, we achieved performance gains of 8\% on factuality classification and 13\% on safety classification. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jhon Rayo, Raul de la Rosa, Mario Garrido</p>
<p>Abstract: Regulatory texts are inherently long and complex, presenting significant challenges for information retrieval systems in supporting regulatory officers with compliance tasks. This paper introduces a hybrid information retrieval system that combines lexical and semantic search techniques to extract relevant information from large regulatory corpora. The system integrates a fine-tuned sentence transformer model with the traditional BM25 algorithm to achieve both semantic precision and lexical coverage. To generate accurate and comprehensive responses, retrieved passages are synthesized using Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid system significantly outperforms standalone lexical and semantic approaches, with notable improvements in Recall@10 and MAP@10. By openly sharing our fine-tuned model and methodology, we aim to advance the development of robust natural language processing tools for compliance-driven applications in regulatory domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Ma, Dongrui Liu, Qian Chen, Linfeng Zhang, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized tasks incurs substantial computational and data costs. While model merging offers a training-free solution to integrate multiple task-specific models, existing methods suffer from safety-utility conflicts where enhanced general capabilities degrade safety safeguards. We identify two root causes: \textbf{neuron misidentification} due to simplistic parameter magnitude-based selection, and \textbf{cross-task neuron interference} during merging. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LED-Merging}, a three-stage framework that \textbf{L}ocates task-specific neurons via gradient-based attribution, dynamically \textbf{E}lects critical neurons through multi-model importance fusion, and \textbf{D}isjoints conflicting updates through parameter isolation. Extensive experiments on Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-13B demonstrate that LED-Merging reduces harmful response rates(\emph{e.g.}, a 31.4\% decrease on Llama-3-8B-Instruct on HarmBench) while preserving 95\% of utility performance(\emph{e.g.}, 52.39\% accuracy on GSM8K). LED-Merging resolves safety-utility conflicts and provides a lightweight, training-free paradigm for constructing reliable multi-task LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays a crucial role in digitizing historical and multilingual documents, yet OCR errors -- imperfect extraction of the text, including character insertion, deletion and permutation -- can significantly impact downstream tasks like question-answering (QA). In this work, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, designed to analyze the effects of OCR noise on QA systems' performance. The MultiOCR-QA dataset comprises 60K question-answer pairs covering three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed old documents, allowing for the evaluation of OCR-induced challenges on question answering. We evaluate MultiOCR-QA on various levels and types of OCR errors to access the robustness of LLMs in handling real-world digitization errors. Our findings show that QA systems are highly prone to OCR induced errors and exhibit performance degradation on noisy OCR text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elyas Meguellati, Nardiena Pratama, Shazia Sadiq, Gianluca Demartini</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality textual training data is essential for the success of multimodal data processing tasks, yet outputs from image captioning models like BLIP and GIT often contain errors and anomalies that are difficult to rectify using rule-based methods. While recent work addressing this issue has predominantly focused on using GPT models for data preprocessing on relatively simple public datasets, there is a need to explore a broader range of Large Language Models (LLMs) and tackle more challenging and diverse datasets.
  In this study, we investigate the use of multiple LLMs, including LLaMA 3.1 70B, GPT-4 Turbo, and Sonnet 3.5 v2, to refine and clean the textual outputs of BLIP and GIT. We assess the impact of LLM-assisted data cleaning by comparing downstream-task (SemEval 2024 Subtask "Multilabel Persuasion Detection in Memes") models trained on cleaned versus non-cleaned data. While our experimental results show improvements when using LLM-cleaned captions, statistical tests reveal that most of these improvements are not significant. This suggests that while LLMs have the potential to enhance data cleaning and repairing, their effectiveness may be limited depending on the context they are applied to, the complexity of the task, and the level of noise in the text.
  Our findings highlight the need for further research into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in data preprocessing pipelines, especially when dealing with challenging datasets, contributing empirical evidence to the ongoing discussion about integrating LLMs into data preprocessing pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Peng, Xinlin Zhuang, Qiu Jiantao, Ren Ma, Jing Yu, Tianyi Bai, Conghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly affected by the quality and composition of their pre-training data, which is inherently diverse, spanning various domains, sources, and topics. Effectively integrating these heterogeneous data sources is crucial for optimizing LLM performance. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on domain-based data mixing, often neglecting the nuanced topic-level characteristics of the data. To address this gap, we propose a simple yet effective topic-based data mixing strategy that utilizes fine-grained topics generated through our topic modeling method, DataWeave. DataWeave employs a multi-stage clustering process to group semantically similar documents and utilizes LLMs to generate detailed topics, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of dataset composition. Our strategy employs heuristic methods to upsample or downsample specific topics, which significantly enhances LLM performance on downstream tasks, achieving superior results compared to previous, more complex data mixing approaches. Furthermore, we confirm that the topics Science and Relationships are particularly effective, yielding the most substantial performance improvements. We will make our code and datasets publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks but face deployment challenges due to high computational costs and memory constraints. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution, transferring knowledge from large teacher models to smaller student models. However, existing KD methods often assume shared vocabularies and tokenizers, limiting their flexibility. While approaches like Universal Logit Distillation (ULD) and Dual-Space Knowledge Distillation (DSKD) address vocabulary mismatches, they overlook the critical \textbf{reasoning-aware distillation} aspect. To bridge this gap, we propose CoT2Align a universal KD framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) augmentation and introduces Cross-CoT Alignment to enhance reasoning transfer. Additionally, we extend Optimal Transport beyond token-wise alignment to a sequence-level and layer-wise alignment approach that adapts to varying sequence lengths while preserving contextual integrity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoT2Align outperforms existing KD methods across different vocabulary settings, improving reasoning capabilities and robustness in domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks due to large training datasets and powerful transformer architecture. However, the reliability of responses from LLMs remains a question. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs is crucial for ensuring their reliability, especially in areas such as healthcare, finance, and decision-making. Existing UQ methods primarily focus on semantic similarity, overlooking the deeper knowledge dimensions embedded in responses. We introduce a multi-dimensional UQ framework that integrates semantic and knowledge-aware similarity analysis. By generating multiple responses and leveraging auxiliary LLMs to extract implicit knowledge, we construct separate similarity matrices and apply tensor decomposition to derive a comprehensive uncertainty representation. This approach disentangles overlapping information from both semantic and knowledge dimensions, capturing both semantic variations and factual consistency, leading to more accurate UQ. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in identifying uncertain responses, offering a more robust framework for enhancing LLM reliability in high-stakes applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Xiao, Hai Ye, Linyao Chen, Hwee Tou Ng, Lidong Bing, Xiaoli Li, Roy Ka-wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative data generation and model retraining are widely used to align large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a policy model to generate on-policy responses and a reward model to guide training data selection. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) further enhances this process by constructing preference pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we aim to \emph{scale up} the number of on-policy samples via repeated random sampling to improve alignment performance. Conventional practice selects the sample with the highest reward as chosen and the lowest as rejected for DPO. However, our experiments reveal that this strategy leads to a \emph{decline} in performance as the sample size increases. To address this, we investigate preference data construction through the lens of underlying normal distribution of sample rewards. We categorize the reward space into seven representative points and systematically explore all 21 ($C_7^2$) pairwise combinations. Through evaluations on four models using AlpacaEval 2, we find that selecting the rejected response at reward position $\mu - 2\sigma$ rather than the minimum reward, is crucial for optimal performance. We finally introduce a scalable preference data construction strategy that consistently enhances model performance as the sample scale increases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event argument extraction identifies arguments for predefined event roles in text. Traditional evaluations rely on exact match (EM), requiring predicted arguments to match annotated spans exactly. However, this approach fails for generative models like large language models (LLMs), which produce diverse yet semantically accurate responses. EM underestimates performance by disregarding valid variations, implicit arguments (unstated but inferable), and scattered arguments (distributed across a document). To bridge this gap, we introduce Reliable Evaluation framework for Generative event argument extraction (REGen), a framework that better aligns with human judgment. Across six datasets, REGen improves performance by an average of 23.93 F1 points over EM. Human validation further confirms REGen's effectiveness, achieving 87.67% alignment with human assessments of argument correctness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabindra Lamsal, Maria Rodriguez Read, Shanika Karunasekera, Muhammad Imran</p>
<p>Abstract: During crises, social media serves as a crucial coordination tool, but the vast influx of posts--from "actionable" requests and offers to generic content like emotional support, behavioural guidance, or outdated information--complicates effective classification. Although generative LLMs (Large Language Models) can address this issue with few-shot classification, their high computational demands limit real-time crisis response. While fine-tuning encoder-only models (e.g., BERT) is a popular choice, these models still exhibit higher inference times in resource-constrained environments. Moreover, although distilled variants (e.g., DistilBERT) exist, they are not tailored for the crisis domain. To address these challenges, we make two key contributions. First, we present CrisisHelpOffer, a novel dataset of 101k tweets collaboratively labelled by generative LLMs and validated by humans, specifically designed to distinguish actionable content from noise. Second, we introduce the first crisis-specific mini models optimized for deployment in resource-constrained settings. Across 13 crisis classification tasks, our mini models surpass BERT (also outperform or match the performance of RoBERTa, MPNet, and BERTweet), offering higher accuracy with significantly smaller sizes and faster speeds. The Medium model is 47% smaller with 3.8% higher accuracy at 3.5x speed, the Small model is 68% smaller with a 1.8% accuracy gain at 7.7x speed, and the Tiny model, 83% smaller, matches BERT's accuracy at 18.6x speed. All models outperform existing distilled variants, setting new benchmarks. Finally, as a case study, we analyze social media posts from a global crisis to explore help-seeking and assistance-offering behaviours in selected developing and developed countries.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel token-level framework, LongAttn, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of LLMs to measure the long-range dependencies for the data. By calculating token-level dependency strength and distribution uniformity of token scores, LongAttn effectively quantifies long-range dependencies, enabling more accurate and efficient data selection. We filter LongABC-32K from open-source long-context datasets (ArXiv, Book, and Code). Through our comprehensive experiments, LongAttn has demonstrated its excellent effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency. To facilitate future research in long-context data, we released our code and the high-quality long-context training data LongABC-32K.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yepeng Weng, Dianwen Mei, Huishi Qiu, Xujie Chen, Li Liu, Jiang Tian, Zhongchao Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. However, these techniques often require a pre-defined cache budget; as the optimal budget varies with different input lengths and task types, it limits their practical deployment accepting open-domain instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yejian Zhang, Shingo Takada</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based classifiers have been used for text classification, such as sentiment analysis, news classification, and toxic comment classification. However, supervised machine learning models often require large amounts of labeled data for training, and manual annotation is both labor-intensive and requires domain-specific knowledge, leading to relatively high annotation costs. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) into an active learning framework. Our approach combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), and active learning, achieving high cross-task text classification performance without the need for any manually labeled data. Furthermore, compared to directly applying GPT for classification tasks, our approach retains over 93% of its classification performance while requiring only approximately 6% of the computational time and monetary cost, effectively balancing performance and resource efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the efficient utilization of LLMs and active learning algorithms in text classification tasks, paving the way for their broader application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Fan, Zhenyi Lu, Sichen Liu, Xiaoye Qu, Wei Wei, Chengfeng Gu, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs), its performance often falls short of Full Fine-Tuning (Full FT). Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixuan Huang, Xunguang Wang, Zongjie Li, Daoyuan Wu, Shuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking methods for large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention for building safe and responsible AI systems. After analyzing 35 jailbreak methods across six categories, we find that existing benchmarks, relying on universal LLM-based or keyword-matching scores, lack case-specific criteria, leading to conflicting results. In this paper, we introduce a more robust evaluation framework for jailbreak methods, with a curated harmful question dataset, detailed case-by-case evaluation guidelines, and a scoring system equipped with these guidelines. Our experiments show that existing jailbreak methods exhibit better discrimination when evaluated using our benchmark. Some jailbreak methods that claim to achieve over 90% attack success rate (ASR) on other benchmarks only reach a maximum of 30.2% on our benchmark, providing a higher ceiling for more advanced jailbreak research; furthermore, using our scoring system reduces the variance of disagreements between different evaluator LLMs by up to 76.33%. This demonstrates its ability to provide more fair and stable evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: While logical reasoning evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention, existing benchmarks predominantly rely on multiple-choice formats that are vulnerable to random guessing, leading to overestimated performance and substantial performance fluctuations. To obtain more accurate assessments of models' reasoning capabilities, we propose an automated method for synthesizing open-ended logic puzzles, and use it to develop a bilingual benchmark, AutoLogi. Our approach features program-based verification and controllable difficulty levels, enabling more reliable evaluation that better distinguishes models' reasoning abilities. Extensive evaluation of eight modern LLMs shows that AutoLogi can better reflect true model capabilities, with performance scores spanning from 35% to 73% compared to the narrower range of 21% to 37% on the source multiple-choice dataset. Beyond benchmark creation, this synthesis method can generate high-quality training data by incorporating program verifiers into the rejection sampling process, enabling systematic enhancement of LLMs' reasoning capabilities across diverse datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dependency parsing is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), aiming to identify syntactic dependencies and construct a syntactic tree for a given sentence. Traditional dependency parsing models typically construct embeddings and utilize additional layers for prediction. We propose a novel dependency parsing method that relies solely on an encoder model with a text-to-text training approach. To facilitate this, we introduce a structured prompt template that effectively captures the structural information of dependency trees. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance compared to traditional models, despite relying solely on a pre-trained model. Furthermore, this method is highly adaptable to various pre-trained models across different target languages and training environments, allowing easy integration of task-specific features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonjin Jang, Keunha Kim, Youngjoong Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Multi-Party Conversation (MPC) models typically rely on graph-based approaches to capture dialogue structures. However, these methods have limitations, such as information loss during the projection of utterances into structural embeddings and constraints in leveraging pre-trained language models directly. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SS-MPC}, a response generation model for MPC that eliminates the need for explicit graph structures. Unlike existing models that depend on graphs to analyze conversation structures, SS-MPC internally encodes the dialogue structure as a sequential input, enabling direct utilization of pre-trained language models. Experimental results show that \textbf{SS-MPC} achieves \textbf{15.60\% BLEU-1} and \textbf{12.44\% ROUGE-L} score, outperforming the current state-of-the-art MPC response generation model by \textbf{3.91\%p} in \textbf{BLEU-1} and \textbf{0.62\%p} in \textbf{ROUGE-L}. Additionally, human evaluation confirms that SS-MPC generates more fluent and accurate responses compared to existing MPC models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal reasoning is fundamental to human cognition and is crucial for various real-world applications. While recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated promising capabilities in temporal reasoning, existing benchmarks primarily rely on rule-based construction, lack contextual depth, and involve a limited range of temporal entities. To address these limitations, we introduce Chinese Time Reasoning (CTM), a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on temporal reasoning within the extensive scope of Chinese dynastic chronology. CTM emphasizes cross-entity relationships, pairwise temporal alignment, and contextualized and culturally-grounded reasoning, providing a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experimental results reveal the challenges posed by CTM and highlight potential avenues for improvement.</p>

To mitigate this, Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) techniques have recently emerged that use various automated techniques to help improve the performance of LLMs on various tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey summarizing the current progress and remaining challenges in this field. We provide a formal definition of APO, a 5-part unifying framework, and then proceed to rigorously categorize all relevant works based on their salient features therein.

<p>Abstract: The application of role-playing large language models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding in both academic and commercial domains, driving an increasing demand for high-precision role-playing models. Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of reasoning techniques has continuously pushed the performance boundaries of LLMs. This intersection of practical role-playing demands and evolving reasoning capabilities raises an important research question: "Can reasoning techniques enhance the role-playing capabilities of LLMs?" To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study using 6 role-playing benchmarks, 24 LLMs, and 3 distinct role-playing strategies, comparing the effectiveness of direct zero-shot role-playing, role-playing with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and role-playing using reasoning-optimized LLMs. Our findings reveal that CoT may reduce role-playing performance, reasoning-optimized LLMs are unsuitable for role-playing, reasoning ability disrupts the role-playing scaling law, large models still lack proficiency in advanced role-playing, and Chinese role-playing performance surpasses English role-playing performance. Furthermore, based on extensive experimental results, we propose two promising future research directions: Role-aware CoT for improving role-playing LLMs and Reinforcement Learning for role-playing LLMs, aiming to enhance the adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness of role-playing LLMs for both research and real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific communication is receiving increasing attention in natural language processing, especially to help researches access, summarize, and generate content. One emerging application in this area is Speech-to-Abstract Generation (SAG), which aims to automatically generate abstracts from recorded scientific presentations. SAG enables researchers to efficiently engage with conference talks, but progress has been limited by a lack of large-scale datasets. To address this gap, we introduce NUTSHELL, a novel multimodal dataset of *ACL conference talks paired with their corresponding abstracts. We establish strong baselines for SAG and evaluate the quality of generated abstracts using both automatic metrics and human judgments. Our results highlight the challenges of SAG and demonstrate the benefits of training on NUTSHELL. By releasing NUTSHELL under an open license (CC-BY 4.0), we aim to advance research in SAG and foster the development of improved models and evaluation methods.</p>

Evaluation across three machine translation datasets demonstrates significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, establishing a new benchmark for Urdu LLMs. These findings underscore the potential of targeted adaptation strategies with limited data and computational resources to address the unique challenges of low-resource languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in understanding and generating long sequences, new safety concerns have been introduced through the long context. However, the safety of LLMs in long-context tasks remains under-explored, leaving a significant gap in both evaluation and improvement of their safety. To address this, we introduce LongSafety, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM safety in open-ended long-context tasks. LongSafety encompasses 7 categories of safety issues and 6 user-oriented long-context tasks, with a total of 1,543 test cases, averaging 5,424 words per context. Our evaluation towards 16 representative LLMs reveals significant safety vulnerabilities, with most models achieving safety rates below 55%. Our findings also indicate that strong safety performance in short-context scenarios does not necessarily correlate with safety in long-context tasks, emphasizing the unique challenges and urgency of improving long-context safety. Moreover, through extensive analysis, we identify challenging safety issues and task types for long-context models. Furthermore, we find that relevant context and extended input sequences can exacerbate safety risks in long-context scenarios, highlighting the critical need for ongoing attention to long-context safety challenges.

<p>Abstract: We introduce MAIA (Multimodal AI Assessment), a native-Italian benchmark designed for fine-grained investigation of the reasoning abilities of visual language models on videos. MAIA differs from other available video benchmarks for its design, its reasoning categories, the metric it uses and the language and culture of the videos. It evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on two aligned tasks: a visual statement verification task, and an open-ended visual question-answering task, both on the same set of video-related questions. It considers twelve reasoning categories that aim to disentangle language and vision relations by highlight when one of two alone encodes sufficient information to solve the tasks, when they are both needed and when the full richness of the short video is essential instead of just a part of it. Thanks to its carefully taught design, it evaluates VLMs' consistency and visually grounded natural language comprehension and generation simultaneously through an aggregated metric. Last but not least, the video collection has been carefully selected to reflect the Italian culture and the language data are produced by native-speakers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to perform multi-step logical reasoning remains an open challenge. Although Chain-of-Thought prompting has improved logical reasoning by enabling models to generate intermediate steps, it lacks mechanisms to assess the coherence of these logical transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight evaluation strategy for logical reasoning that uses query-key alignments inside transformer attention heads. By computing a single forward pass and extracting a "QK-score" from carefully chosen heads, our method reveals latent representations that reliably separate valid from invalid inferences, offering a scalable alternative to traditional ablation-based techniques. We also provide an empirical validation on multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness of our evaluation method against distractors and increased reasoning depth. The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of models, ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Xiaolin Hu, Huayi Tang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) abilities. However, existing theoretical analysis of ICL primarily exhibits two limitations: (a) Limited i.i.d. Setting. Most studies focus on supervised function learning tasks where prompts are constructed with i.i.d. input-label pairs. This i.i.d. assumption diverges significantly from real language learning scenarios where prompt tokens are interdependent. (b) Lack of Emergence Explanation. Most literature answers what ICL does from an implicit optimization perspective but falls short in elucidating how ICL emerges and the impact of pre-training phase on ICL. In our paper, to extend (a), we adopt a more practical paradigm, auto-regressive next-token prediction (AR-NTP), which closely aligns with the actual training of language models. Specifically, within AR-NTP, we emphasize prompt token-dependency, which involves predicting each subsequent token based on the preceding sequence. To address (b), we formalize a systematic pre-training and ICL framework, highlighting the layer-wise structure of sequences and topics, alongside a two-level expectation. In conclusion, we present data-dependent, topic-dependent and optimization-dependent PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for pre-trained LLMs, investigating that ICL emerges from the generalization of sequences and topics. Our theory is supported by experiments on numerical linear dynamic systems, synthetic GINC and real-world language datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longchao Da, Xiaoou Liu, Jiaxin Dai, Lu Cheng, Yaqing Wang, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the uncertainty in large language model (LLM) explanations is important for evaluating their faithfulness and reasoning consistency, and thus provides insights into the reliability of LLM's output regarding a question. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lovisa Hagstr\"om, Ercong Nie, Ruben Halifa, Helmut Schmid, Richard Johansson, Alexander Junge</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) re-rankers are used to refine retrieval results for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). They are more expensive than lexical matching methods like BM25 but assumed to better process semantic information. To understand whether LM re-rankers always live up to this assumption, we evaluate 6 different LM re-rankers on the NQ, LitQA2 and DRUID datasets. Our results show that LM re-rankers struggle to outperform a simple BM25 re-ranker on DRUID. Leveraging a novel separation metric based on BM25 scores, we explain and identify re-ranker errors stemming from lexical dissimilarities. We also investigate different methods to improve LM re-ranker performance and find these methods mainly useful for NQ. Taken together, our work identifies and explains weaknesses of LM re-rankers and points to the need for more adversarial and realistic datasets for their evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Li, Wenbin Hu, Huihao Jing, Yulin Chen, Qi Hu, Sirui Han, Tianshu Chu, Peizhao Hu, Yangqiu Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative large language models (LLMs) have enabled wider applicability, accessibility, and flexibility. However, their reliability and trustworthiness are still in doubt, especially for concerns regarding individuals' data privacy. Great efforts have been made on privacy by building various evaluation benchmarks to study LLMs' privacy awareness and robustness from their generated outputs to their hidden representations. Unfortunately, most of these works adopt a narrow formulation of privacy and only investigate personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we follow the merit of the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory, which posits that privacy evaluation should not only cover the transmitted attributes but also encompass the whole relevant social context through private information flows. We present PrivaCI-Bench, a comprehensive contextual privacy evaluation benchmark targeted at legal compliance to cover well-annotated privacy and safety regulations, real court cases, privacy policies, and synthetic data built from the official toolkit to study LLMs' privacy and safety compliance. We evaluate the latest LLMs, including the recent reasoner models QwQ-32B and Deepseek R1. Our experimental results suggest that though LLMs can effectively capture key CI parameters inside a given context, they still require further advancements for privacy compliance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashhadul Islam, Samir Brahim Belhaouari, Amine Bermak</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has revolutionized artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing. However, the extensive computational resources required for training these models have significant environmental implications, including high carbon emissions, energy consumption, and water usage. This research presents a novel approach to LLM pruning, focusing on the systematic evaluation of individual weight importance throughout the training process. By monitoring parameter evolution over time, we propose a method that effectively reduces model size without compromising performance. Extensive experiments with both a scaled-down LLM and a large multimodal model reveal that moderate pruning enhances efficiency and reduces loss, while excessive pruning drastically deteriorates model performance. These findings highlight the critical need for optimized AI models to ensure sustainable development, balancing technological advancement with environmental responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungyu Shin, Jingyu Tang, Yoonjoo Lee, Nayoung Kim, Hyunseung Lim, Ji Yong Cho, Hwajung Hong, Moontae Lee, Juho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress, but it faces challenges such as reviewer shortages and growing workloads. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for providing assistance, research has reported significant limitations in the reviews they generate. While the insights are valuable, conducting the analysis is challenging due to the considerable time and effort required, especially given the rapid pace of LLM developments. To address the challenge, we developed an automatic evaluation pipeline to assess the LLMs' paper review capability by comparing them with expert-generated reviews. By constructing a dataset consisting of 676 OpenReview papers, we examined the agreement between LLMs and experts in their strength and weakness identifications. The results showed that LLMs lack balanced perspectives, significantly overlook novelty assessment when criticizing, and produce poor acceptance decisions. Our automated pipeline enables a scalable evaluation of LLMs' paper review capability over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gili Lior, Liron Nacchace, Gabriel Stanovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans are influenced by how information is presented, a phenomenon known as the framing effect. Previous work has shown that LLMs may also be susceptible to framing but has done so on synthetic data and did not compare to human behavior. We introduce WildFrame, a dataset for evaluating LLM responses to positive and negative framing, in naturally-occurring sentences, and compare humans on the same data. WildFrame consists of 1,000 texts, first selecting real-world statements with clear sentiment, then reframing them in either positive or negative light, and lastly, collecting human sentiment annotations. By evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs on WildFrame, we find that all models exhibit framing effects similar to humans ($r\geq0.57$), with both humans and models being more influenced by positive rather than negative reframing. Our findings benefit model developers, who can either harness framing or mitigate its effects, depending on the downstream application.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid increase in mobile device usage necessitates improved automation for seamless task management. However, many AI-driven frameworks struggle due to insufficient operational knowledge. Manually written knowledge helps but is labor-intensive and inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-Agent-V, a framework that leverages video guidance to provide rich and cost-effective operational knowledge for mobile automation. Mobile-Agent-V enhances task execution capabilities by leveraging video inputs without requiring specialized sampling or preprocessing. Mobile-Agent-V integrates a sliding window strategy and incorporates a video agent and deep-reflection agent to ensure that actions align with user instructions. Through this innovative approach, users can record task processes with guidance, enabling the system to autonomously learn and execute tasks efficiently. Experimental results show that Mobile-Agent-V achieves a 30% performance improvement compared to existing frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Ad\'am Kov\'acs, G\'abor Recski</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain vulnerable to hallucinated answers despite incorporating external knowledge sources. We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long context is an important topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP), running through the development of NLP architectures, and offers immense opportunities for Large Language Models (LLMs) giving LLMs the lifelong learning potential akin to humans. Unfortunately, the pursuit of a long context is accompanied by numerous obstacles. Nevertheless, long context remains a core competitive advantage for LLMs. In the past two years, the context length of LLMs has achieved a breakthrough extension to millions of tokens. Moreover, the research on long-context LLMs has expanded from length extrapolation to a comprehensive focus on architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation technologies.
  Inspired by the symphonic poem, Thus Spake Zarathustra, we draw an analogy between the journey of extending the context of LLM and the attempts of humans to transcend its mortality. In this survey, We will illustrate how LLM struggles between the tremendous need for a longer context and its equal need to accept the fact that it is ultimately finite. To achieve this, we give a global picture of the lifecycle of long-context LLMs from four perspectives: architecture, infrastructure, training, and evaluation, showcasing the full spectrum of long-context technologies. At the end of this survey, we will present 10 unanswered questions currently faced by long-context LLMs. We hope this survey can serve as a systematic introduction to the research on long-context LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsen Tolebay Nurlanuly</p>
<p>Abstract: A sentiment analysis system powered by machine learning was created in this study to improve real-time social network public opinion monitoring. For sophisticated sentiment identification, the suggested approach combines cutting-edge transformer-based architectures (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) with traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes). The system achieved an accuracy of up to 80-85% using transformer models in real-world scenarios after being tested using both deep learning techniques and standard machine learning processes on annotated social media datasets. According to experimental results, deep learning models perform noticeably better than lexicon-based and conventional rule-based classifiers, lowering misclassification rates and enhancing the ability to recognize nuances like sarcasm. According to feature importance analysis, context tokens, sentiment-bearing keywords, and part-of-speech structure are essential for precise categorization. The findings confirm that AI-driven sentiment frameworks can provide a more adaptive and efficient approach to modern sentiment challenges. Despite the system's impressive performance, issues with computing overhead, data quality, and domain-specific terminology still exist. In order to monitor opinions on a broad scale, future research will investigate improving computing performance, extending coverage to various languages, and integrating real-time streaming APIs. The results demonstrate that governments, corporations, and social researchers looking for more in-depth understanding of public mood on digital platforms can find a reliable and adaptable answer in AI-powered sentiment analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mar\'ia Andrea Cruz Bland\'on, Jayasimha Talur, Bruno Charron, Dong Liu, Saab Mansour, Marcello Federico</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic evaluation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems relies on fine-grained dimensions like faithfulness and relevance, as judged by expert human annotators. Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of automatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data, which fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better representation of the end user experience.
  In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG benchmark (MEMERAG). Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using native-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language models (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness and relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves high inter-annotator agreement. We then analyse the performance of the answer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators. Finally we apply the dataset to our main use-case which is to benchmark multilingual automatic evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). We show that our benchmark can reliably identify improvements offered by advanced prompting techniques and LLMs. We release our benchmark to support the community developing accurate evaluation methods for multilingual RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanghai Liu, Quzhe Huang, Qingjing Chen, Yiran Hu, Jiayu Ma, Yun Liu, Weixing Shen, Yansong Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The Four-Element Theory is a fundamental framework in criminal law, defining the constitution of crime through four dimensions: Subject, Object, Subjective aspect, and Objective aspect. This theory is widely referenced in legal reasoning, and many Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to incorporate it when handling legal tasks. However, current approaches rely on LLMs' internal knowledge to incorporate this theory, often lacking completeness and representativeness. To address this limitation, we introduce JUREX-4E, an expert-annotated knowledge base covering 155 criminal charges. It is structured through a progressive hierarchical annotation framework that prioritizes legal source validity and employs diverse legal interpretation methods to ensure comprehensiveness and authority. We evaluate JUREX-4E on the Similar Charge Distinction task and apply it to Legal Case Retrieval, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving LLM performance. Experimental results validate the high quality of JUREX-4E and its substantial impact on downstream legal tasks, underscoring its potential for advancing legal AI applications.

<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate promising long context processing capabilities, with recent models touting context windows close to one million tokens. However, the evaluations supporting these claims often involve simple retrieval tasks or synthetic tasks padded with irrelevant text, which the models may easily detect and discard. In this work, we generate lengthy simplified English text with first-order logic representations spanning up to 2048 clauses (around 25k GPT-4 tokens). We formulate an evaluation task with evidence retrieval for contradiction detection. The long, homogeneous text is filled with distractors that are both hard to distinguish from relevant evidences and provably not interfering with them. Our evaluation of evidence retrieval shows that the effective context window is much smaller with realistic distractors, already crumbling at 128 clauses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuming Yang, Yang Nan, Junjie Ye, Shihan Dou, Xiao Wang, Shuo Li, Huijie Lv, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data diversity is crucial for the instruction tuning of large language models. Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by assessing their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information distribution in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level "novelty." Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance, highlighting its value in guiding data engineering practices. With NovelSum as an optimization objective, we further develop a greedy, diversity-oriented data selection strategy that outperforms existing approaches, validating both the effectiveness and practical significance of our metric.</p>

There is a substantial amount of research on how to train such models and how to select hyperparameters for this architecture. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on post-evaluation analysis of MoE layer properties. In this paper, we take a first step toward closing this gap by evaluating expert contributions on the quiz-based MMLU benchmark. We show that most experts were never activated during inference on this benchmark. Additionally, the output distribution of gating networks is much closer to uniform than sparse. Finally, we demonstrate that the average performance of some experts within the same layer varies significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world instructions with multiple constraints pose a significant challenge to existing large language models (LLMs). An observation is that the LLMs exhibit dramatic performance fluctuation when disturbing the order of the incorporated constraints. Yet, none of the existing works has systematically investigated this position bias problem in the field of multi-constraint instruction following. To bridge this gap, we design a probing task where we quantitatively measure the difficulty distribution of the constraints by a novel Difficulty Distribution Index (CDDI). Through the experimental results, we find that LLMs are more performant when presented with the constraints in a ``hard-to-easy'' order. This preference can be generalized to LLMs with different architecture or different sizes of parameters. Additionally, we conduct an explanation study, providing an intuitive insight into the correlation between the LLM's attention and constraint orders.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxuan Zhang, Ruqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on LLaMA Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Baichuan-Audio, an end-to-end audio large language model that seamlessly integrates audio understanding and generation. It features a text-guided aligned speech generation mechanism, enabling real-time speech interaction with both comprehension and generation capabilities. Baichuan-Audio leverages a pre-trained ASR model, followed by multi-codebook discretization of speech at a frame rate of 12.5 Hz. This multi-codebook setup ensures that speech tokens retain both semantic and acoustic information. To further enhance modeling, an independent audio head is employed to process audio tokens, effectively capturing their unique characteristics. To mitigate the loss of intelligence during pre-training and preserve the original capabilities of the LLM, we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy that maintains language understanding while enhancing audio modeling. Following alignment, the model excels in real-time speech-based conversation and exhibits outstanding question-answering capabilities, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance in real-time spoken dialogue and exhibits strong question-answering abilities.

<p>Abstract: Question answering on the hybrid context of tables and text (TATQA) is a critical task, with broad applications in data-intensive domains. However, existing TATQA datasets are limited to English, leading to several drawbacks: (i) They overlook the challenges of multilingual TAT-QA and cannot assess model performance in the multilingual setting. (ii) They do not reflect real-world scenarios where tables and texts frequently appear in non-English languages. To address the limitations, we propose the first multilingual TATQA dataset (MULTITAT). Specifically, we sample data from 3 mainstream TATQA datasets and translate it into 10 diverse languages. To align the model TATQA capabilities in English with other languages, we develop a baseline, Ours. Experimental results reveal that the performance on non-English data in MULTITAT drops by an average of 19.4% compared to English, proving the necessity of MULTITAT. We further analyze the reasons for this performance gap. Furthermore, Ours outperforms other baselines by an average of 3.3, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17262">Unveiling Downstream Performance Scaling of LLMs: A Clustering-Based Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyin Xu, Kaiyuan Chen, Xiao Li, Ke Shen, Chenggang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Steindl, Ulrich Sch\"afer, Bernd Ludwig</p>
<p>Abstract: Data scarcity is one of the main problems when it comes to real-world applications of transformer-based models. This is especially evident for task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, which require specialized datasets, that are usually not readily available. This can hinder companies from adding TOD systems to their services. This study therefore investigates a novel approach to sourcing annotated dialogues from existing German monologue material. Focusing on a real-world example, we investigate whether these monologues can be transformed into dialogue formats suitable for training TOD systems. We show the approach with the concrete example of a company specializing in travel bookings via e-mail. We fine-tune state-of-the-art Large Language Models for the task of rewriting e-mails as dialogues and annotating them. To ensure the quality and validity of the generated data, we employ crowd workers to evaluate the dialogues across multiple criteria and to provide gold-standard annotations for the test dataset. We further evaluate the usefulness of the dialogues for training TOD systems. Our evaluation shows that the dialogues and annotations are of high quality and can serve as a valuable starting point for training TOD systems. Finally, we make the annotated dataset publicly available to foster future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andra\v{z} Repar, Nada Lavra\v{c}, Senja Pollak</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated terminology extraction refers to the task of extracting meaningful terms from domain-specific texts. This paper proposes a novel machine learning approach to terminology extraction, which combines features from traditional term extraction systems with novel contextual features derived from contextual word embeddings. Instead of using a predefined list of part-of-speech patterns, we first analyse a new term-annotated corpus RSDO5 for the Slovenian language and devise a set of rules for term candidate selection and then generate statistical, linguistic and context-based features. We use a support-vector machine algorithm to train a classification model, evaluate it on the four domains (biomechanics, linguistics, chemistry, veterinary) of the RSDO5 corpus and compare the results with state-of-art term extraction approaches for the Slovenian language. Our approach provides significant improvements in terms of F1 score over the previous state-of-the-art, which proves that contextual word embeddings are valuable for improving term extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Kai Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like instruction-following abilities, particularly those exceeding 100 billion parameters. The combined capability of some smaller, resource-friendly LLMs can address most of the instructions that larger LLMs excel at. In this work, we explore how to route the best-performing LLM for each instruction to achieve better overall performance. We develop a new paradigm, constructing capability instructions with model capability representation, user instruction, and performance inquiry prompts to assess the performance. To learn from capability instructions, we introduce a new end-to-end framework called Model Selection with Aptitude Test (Model-SAT), which generates positive and negative samples based on what different models perform well or struggle with. Model-SAT uses a model capability encoder that extends its model representation to a lightweight LLM. Our experiments show that Model-SAT understands the performance dimensions of candidate models and provides the probabilities of their capability to handle various instructions. Additionally, during deployment, a new model can quickly infer its aptitude test results across 50 tasks, each with 20 shots. Model-SAT performs state-of-the-art model routing without candidate inference and in real-world new model-released scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Golshid Shekoufandeh, Paul Boersma, Antal van den Bosch</p>
<p>Abstract: We test and study the variation in speech recognition of fine-tuned versions of the Whisper model on child, elderly and non-native Dutch speech from the JASMIN-CGN corpus. Our primary goal is to evaluate how speakers' age and linguistic background influence Whisper's performance. Whisper achieves varying Word Error Rates (WER) when fine-tuned on subpopulations of specific ages and linguistic backgrounds. Fine-tuned performance is remarkably better than zero-shot performance, achieving a relative reduction in WER of 81% for native children, 72% for non-native children, 67% for non-native adults, and 65% for native elderly people. Our findings underscore the importance of training speech recognition models like Whisper on underrepresented subpopulations such as children, the elderly, and non-native speakers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Li, Chunming Hu, Junfan Chen, Zhijun Chen, Richong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Word order difference between source and target languages is a major obstacle to cross-lingual transfer, especially in the dependency parsing task. Current works are mostly based on order-agnostic models or word reordering to mitigate this problem. However, such methods either do not leverage grammatical information naturally contained in word order or are computationally expensive as the permutation space grows exponentially with the sentence length. Moreover, the reordered source sentence with an unnatural word order may be a form of noising that harms the model learning. To this end, we propose an Implicit Word Reordering framework with Knowledge Distillation (IWR-KD). This framework is inspired by that deep networks are good at learning feature linearization corresponding to meaningful data transformation, e.g. word reordering. To realize this idea, we introduce a knowledge distillation framework composed of a word-reordering teacher model and a dependency parsing student model. We verify our proposed method on Universal Dependency Treebanks across 31 different languages and show it outperforms a series of competitors, together with experimental analysis to illustrate how our method works towards training a robust parser.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghao Liu, Haolan Wang, Xinze Li, Qiushi Xiong, Xiaocui Yang, Yu Gu, Yukun Yan, Qi Shi, Fangfang Li, Ge Yu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data contains rich structural semantics and plays a crucial role in organizing and manipulating information. To better capture these structural semantics, this paper introduces the HybrId-modal Preference oPtimizatiOn (HIPPO) model, which represents tables using both text and image, and optimizes MLLMs to effectively learn more comprehensive table information from these multiple modalities. Specifically, HIPPO samples model responses from hybrid-modal table representations and designs a modality-consistent sampling strategy to enhance response diversity and mitigate modality bias during DPO training. Experimental results on table question answering and table fact verification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HIPPO, achieving a 4% improvement over various table reasoning models. Further analysis reveals that HIPPO not only enhances reasoning abilities based on unimodal table representations but also facilitates the extraction of crucial and distinct semantics from different modal representations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Xiangyu Peng, Shilpa Bhagavath, Caiming Xiong, Shiva Kumar Pentyala, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated service agents require well-structured workflows to provide consistent and accurate responses to customer queries. However, these workflows are often undocumented, and their automatic extraction from conversations remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel framework for extracting and evaluating dialog workflows from historical interactions. Our extraction process consists of two key stages: (1) a retrieval step to select relevant conversations based on key procedural elements, and (2) a structured workflow generation process using a question-answer-based chain-of-thought (QA-CoT) prompting. To comprehensively assess the quality of extracted workflows, we introduce an automated agent and customer bots simulation framework that measures their effectiveness in resolving customer issues. Extensive experiments on the ABCD and SynthABCD datasets demonstrate that our QA-CoT technique improves workflow extraction by 12.16\% in average macro accuracy over the baseline. Moreover, our evaluation method closely aligns with human assessments, providing a reliable and scalable framework for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Mutual Reinforcing Data Synthesis (MRDS) within LLMs to improve few-shot dialogue summarization task. Unlike prior methods that require external knowledge, we mutually reinforce the LLM\'s dialogue synthesis and summarization capabilities, allowing them to complement each other during training and enhance overall performances. The dialogue synthesis capability is enhanced by directed preference optimization with preference scoring from summarization capability. The summarization capability is enhanced by the additional high quality dialogue-summary paired data produced by the dialogue synthesis capability. By leveraging the proposed MRDS mechanism, we elicit the internal knowledge of LLM in the format of synthetic data, and use it to augment the few-shot real training dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that our method improves dialogue summarization, achieving a 1.5% increase in ROUGE scores and a 0.3% improvement in BERT scores in few-shot settings. Furthermore, our method attains the highest average scores in human evaluations, surpassing both the pre-trained models and the baselines fine-tuned solely for summarization tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In large language models (LLMs), certain neurons can store distinct pieces of knowledge learned during pretraining. While knowledge typically appears as a combination of relations and entities, it remains unclear whether some neurons focus on a relation itself -- independent of any entity. We hypothesize such neurons detect a relation in the input text and guide generation involving such a relation. To investigate this, we study the Llama-2 family on a chosen set of relations with a statistics-based method. Our experiments demonstrate the existence of relation-specific neurons. We measure the effect of selectively deactivating candidate neurons specific to relation $r$ on the LLM's ability to handle (1) facts whose relation is $r$ and (2) facts whose relation is a different relation $r' \neq r$. With respect to their capacity for encoding relation information, we give evidence for the following three properties of relation-specific neurons. $\textbf{(i) Neuron cumulativity.}$ The neurons for $r$ present a cumulative effect so that deactivating a larger portion of them results in the degradation of more facts in $r$. $\textbf{(ii) Neuron versatility.}$ Neurons can be shared across multiple closely related as well as less related relations. Some relation neurons transfer across languages. $\textbf{(iii) Neuron interference.}$ Deactivating neurons specific to one relation can improve LLM generation performance for facts of other relations. We will make our code publicly available at https://github.com/cisnlp/relation-specific-neurons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toheeb A. Jimoh, Tabea De Wille, Nikola S. Nikolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is becoming a dominant subset of artificial intelligence as the need to help machines understand human language looks indispensable. Several NLP applications are ubiquitous, partly due to the myriads of datasets being churned out daily through mediums like social networking sites. However, the growing development has not been evident in most African languages due to the persisting resource limitation, among other issues. Yor\`ub\'a language, a tonal and morphologically rich African language, suffers a similar fate, resulting in limited NLP usage. To encourage further research towards improving this situation, this systematic literature review aims to comprehensively analyse studies addressing NLP development for Yor\`ub\'a, identifying challenges, resources, techniques, and applications. A well-defined search string from a structured protocol was employed to search, select, and analyse 105 primary studies between 2014 and 2024 from reputable databases. The review highlights the scarcity of annotated corpora, limited availability of pre-trained language models, and linguistic challenges like tonal complexity and diacritic dependency as significant obstacles. It also revealed the prominent techniques, including rule-based methods, among others. The findings reveal a growing body of multilingual and monolingual resources, even though the field is constrained by socio-cultural factors such as code-switching and desertion of language for digital usage. This review synthesises existing research, providing a foundation for advancing NLP for Yor\`ub\'a and in African languages generally. It aims to guide future research by identifying gaps and opportunities, thereby contributing to the broader inclusion of Yor\`ub\'a and other under-resourced African languages in global NLP advancements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Asking questions is a fundamental aspect of learning that facilitates deeper understanding. However, characterizing and crafting questions that effectively improve learning remains elusive. To address this gap, we propose QUEST (Question Utility Estimation with Simulated Tests). QUEST simulates a learning environment that enables the quantification of a question's utility based on its direct impact on improving learning outcomes. Furthermore, we can identify high-utility questions and use them to fine-tune question generation models with rejection sampling. We find that questions generated by models trained with rejection sampling based on question utility result in exam scores that are higher by at least 20% than those from specialized prompting grounded on educational objectives literature and models fine-tuned with indirect measures of question quality, such as saliency and expected information gain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoun Kim, Jacob Springer, Aditi Raghunathan, Maarten Sap</p>
<p>Abstract: In retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, each individual component -- the LLM, embedder, and corpus -- could introduce biases in the form of skews towards outputting certain perspectives or identities. In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Parekh, Yuxuan Dong, Lucas Bandarkar, Artin Kim, I-Hung Hsu, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Detection (ED) is the task of identifying typed event mentions of interest from natural language text, which benefits domain-specific reasoning in biomedical, legal, and epidemiological domains. However, procuring supervised data for thousands of events for various domains is a laborious and expensive task. To this end, existing works have explored synthetic data generation via forward (generating labels for unlabeled sentences) and inverse (generating sentences from generated labels) generations. However, forward generation often produces noisy labels, while inverse generation struggles with domain drift and incomplete event annotations. To address these challenges, we introduce FIG, a hybrid approach that leverages inverse generation for high-quality data synthesis while anchoring it to domain-specific cues extracted via forward generation on unlabeled target data. FIG further enhances its synthetic data by adding missing annotations through forward generation-based refinement. Experimentation on three ED datasets from diverse domains reveals that FIG outperforms the best baseline achieving average gains of 3.3% F1 and 5.4% F1 in the zero-shot and few-shot settings respectively. Analyzing the generated trigger hit rate and human evaluation substantiates FIG's superior domain alignment and data quality compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guijin Son, Jiwoo Hong, Hyunwoo Ko, James Thorne</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling pre-training compute has proven effective for achieving mulitlinguality, but does the same hold for test-time scaling? In this work, we introduce MCLM, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. We test three test-time scaling methods-Outcome Reward Modeling (ORM), Process Reward Modeling (ORM), and Budget Forcing (BF)-on both Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B, a multilingual LLM we trained for extended reasoning. Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2. Although "thinking LLMs" have recently garnered significant attention, we find that their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. Moreover, while BF yields a 20-point improvement on English AIME, it provides only a 1.94-point average gain across other languages-a pattern consistent across the other test-time scaling methods we studied-higlighting that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks. To foster further research, we release MCLM, MR1-1.5B, and evaluation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikunj Saunshi, Nishanth Dikkala, Zhiyuan Li, Sanjiv Kumar, Sashank J. Reddi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable reasoning abilities and scaling laws suggest that large parameter count, especially along the depth axis, is the primary driver. In this work, we make a stronger claim -- many reasoning problems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This unlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show that for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction, and math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the performance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than a $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing that many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and thus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth. Perhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of language modeling -- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with $k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a $kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior that depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT reasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and can simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we also present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and design a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a promising technique to mitigate the high inference latency of autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeshun You, Jiebin Yao, Dong Cheng, Zhiwei Wen, Zhiliang Lu, Xianyi Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The text-to-SQL task aims to convert natural language into Structured Query Language (SQL) without bias. Recently, text-to-SQL methods based on large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention. The core of mainstream text-to-SQL frameworks is schema linking, which aligns user queries with relevant tables and columns in the database. Previous methods focused on schema linking while neglecting to enhance LLMs' understanding of database schema. The complex coupling relationships between tables in the database constrain the SQL generation capabilities of LLMs. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective strategy called view-based schema. This strategy aids LLMs in understanding the database schema by decoupling tightly coupled tables into low-coupling views. We then introduce V-SQL, a view-based two-stage text-to-SQL framework. V-SQL involves the view-based schema strategy to enhance LLMs' understanding of database schema. Results on the authoritative datasets Bird indicate that V-SQL achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

However, little attention and effort has been paid to the Chinese web search, which results in that the capabilities of open-source models have not been uniformly and fairly evaluated. The difficulty lies in lacking three aspects: an unified agent framework, an accurately labeled dataset, and a suitable evaluation metric. To address these issues, we propose a general-purpose and training-free web search agent by level-aware navigation, Level-Navi Agent, accompanied by a well-annotated dataset (Web24) and a suitable evaluation metric. Level-Navi Agent can think through complex user questions and conduct searches across various levels on the internet to gather information for questions. Meanwhile, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs under fair settings. To further facilitate future research, source code is available at Github.</p>

<p>Abstract: Familiarizing oneself with a new scientific field and its existing literature can be daunting due to the large amount of available articles. Curated lists of academic references, or reading lists, compiled by experts, offer a structured way to gain a comprehensive overview of a domain or a specific scientific challenge. In this work, we introduce ACL-rlg, the largest open expert-annotated reading list dataset. We also provide multiple baselines for evaluating reading list generation and formally define it as a retrieval task. Our qualitative study highlights the fact that traditional scholarly search engines and indexing methods perform poorly on this task, and GPT-4o, despite showing better results, exhibits signs of potential data contamination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Arslan (Le2i, ICB), Saba Munawar (NUCES), Christophe Cruz</p>
<p>Abstract: Businesses heavily rely on data sourced from various channels like news articles, financial reports, and consumer reviews to drive their operations, enabling informed decision-making and identifying opportunities. However, traditional manual methods for data extraction are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the adoption of digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency. Yet, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a sustainable solution for Information Extraction (IE) and processing. The research methodology involves reviewing existing solutions for business decision-making, noting that many systems require training new machine learning models, which are resource-intensive and have significant environmental impacts. Instead, we propose a sustainable business solution using pre-existing LLMs that can work with diverse datasets. We link domain-specific datasets to tailor LLMs to company needs and employ a Multi-Agent architecture to divide tasks such as information retrieval, enrichment, and classification among specialized agents. This approach optimizes the extraction process and improves overall efficiency. Through the utilization of these technologies, businesses can optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making processes, and contribute to sustainable development goals, thereby fostering environmental responsibility within the corporate sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Arslan (Le2i, ICB), Saba Munawar (NUCES), Christophe Cruz (ICB)</p>
<p>Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, media content stands as the foundation for political news analysis, offering invaluable insights sourced from various channels like news articles, social media updates, speeches, and reports. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized Political Information Extraction (IE), automating tasks such as Event Extraction (EE) from these diverse media outlets. While traditional NLP methods often necessitate specialized expertise to build rule-based systems or train machine learning models with domain-specific datasets, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a promising alternative. These models offer accessibility, alleviating challenges associated with model construction from scratch and reducing the dependency on extensive datasets during the training phase, thus facilitating rapid implementation. However, challenges persist in handling domain-specific tasks, leading to the development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating external data retrieval, enriching their contextual understanding, and expanding their knowledge base beyond pre-existing training data. To illustrate RAG's efficacy, we introduce the Political EE system, specifically tailored to extract political event information from news articles. Understanding these political insights is essential for remaining informed about the latest political advancements, whether on a national or global scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Xue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing tasks, with the potential to automate systematic reviews. This study evaluates the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs in conducting systematic review tasks. We assessed GPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral 8x7B across four systematic review tasks: study design formulation, search strategy development, literature screening, and data extraction. Sourced from a previously published systematic review, we provided reference standard including standard PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) design, standard eligibility criteria, and data from 20 reference literature. Three investigators evaluated the quality of study design and eligibility criteria using 5-point Liker Scale in terms of accuracy, integrity, relevance, consistency and overall performance. For other tasks, the output is defined as accurate if it is the same as the reference standard. Search strategy performance was evaluated through accuracy and retrieval efficacy. Screening accuracy was assessed for both abstracts screening and full texts screening. Data extraction accuracy was evaluated across 1,120 data points comprising 3,360 individual fields. Claude-3 demonstrated superior overall performance in PICO design. In search strategy formulation, GPT-4 and Claude-3 achieved comparable accuracy, outperforming Mistral. For abstract screening, GPT-4 achieved the highest accuracy, followed by Mistral and Claude-3. In data extraction, GPT-4 significantly outperformed other models. LLMs demonstrate potential for automating systematic review tasks, with GPT-4 showing superior performance in search strategy formulation, literature screening and data extraction. These capabilities make them promising assistive tools for researchers and warrant further development and validation in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghong Zhang, Yidong Cui, Weiling Wang, Xianyou Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of technology and changes in the market, the demand for the construction of domain-specific knowledge bases has been increasing, either to improve model performance or to promote enterprise innovation and competitiveness. The construction of domain-specific knowledge bases typically relies on web crawlers or existing industry databases, leading to problems with accuracy and consistency of the data. To address these challenges, we considered the characteristics of domain data, where internal knowledge is interconnected, and proposed the Self-Natural Language Inference Data Filtering (self-nli-TDF) framework. This framework compares trusted filtered knowledge with the data to be filtered, deducing the reasoning relationship between them, thus improving filtering performance. The framework uses plug-and-play large language models for trustworthiness assessment and employs the RoBERTa-MNLI model from the NLI domain for reasoning. We constructed three datasets in the domains of biology, radiation, and science, and conducted experiments using RoBERTa, GPT3.5, and the local Qwen2 model. The experimental results show that this framework improves filter quality, producing more consistent and reliable filtering results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Agarwal, Sai Sundaresan, Subrata Mitra, Debabrata Mahapatra, Archit Gupta, Rounak Sharma, Nirmal Joshua Kapu, Tong Yu, Shiv Saini</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is often used with Large Language Models (LLMs) to infuse domain knowledge or user-specific information. In RAG, given a user query, a retriever extracts chunks of relevant text from a knowledge base. These chunks are sent to an LLM as part of the input prompt. Typically, any given chunk is repeatedly retrieved across user questions. However, currently, for every question, attention-layers in LLMs fully compute the key values (KVs) repeatedly for the input chunks, as state-of-the-art methods cannot reuse KV-caches when chunks appear at arbitrary locations with arbitrary contexts. Naive reuse leads to output quality degradation. This leads to potentially redundant computations on expensive GPUs and increases latency. In this work, we propose Cache-Craft, a system for managing and reusing precomputed KVs corresponding to the text chunks (we call chunk-caches) in RAG-based systems. We present how to identify chunk-caches that are reusable, how to efficiently perform a small fraction of recomputation to fix the cache to maintain output quality, and how to efficiently store and evict chunk-caches in the hardware for maximizing reuse while masking any overheads. With real production workloads as well as synthetic datasets, we show that Cache-Craft reduces redundant computation by 51% over SOTA prefix-caching and 75% over full recomputation. Additionally, with continuous batching on a real production workload, we get a 1.6X speed up in throughput and a 2X reduction in end-to-end response latency over prefix-caching while maintaining quality, for both the LLaMA-3-8B and LLaMA-3-70B models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently used extensively to generate code by professionals and students, motivating the development of tools to detect LLM-generated code for applications such as academic integrity and cybersecurity. We address this authorship attribution problem as a binary classification task along with feature identification and extraction. We propose new Discretized Nested Bigram Frequency features on source code groups of various sizes.

Experimental evaluation demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed a commonly used GPT code-detection API and baseline features, with accuracy exceeding 96% compared to 72% and 79% respectively in detecting GPT-rewritten Java code fragments for 976 files with GPT 3.5 and GPT4 using 12 features. We also outperformed three prior works on code author identification in a 40-author dataset. Our approach scales well to larger data sets, and we achieved 99% accuracy and 0.999 AUC for 76,089 files and over 1,000 authors with GPT 4o using 227 features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving complex tasks in a single attempt is challenging for large language models (LLMs). Iterative interaction with the environment and feedback is often required to achieve success, making effective feedback utilization a critical topic. Existing approaches either struggle with length generalization or rely on naive retries without leveraging prior information. In this paper, we introduce FTTT, a novel paradigm that formulates feedback utilization as an optimization problem at test time. Additionally, we propose a learnable test-time optimizer, OpTune, to effectively exploit feedback. Experiments on two LLMs across four reasoning datasets demonstrate that FTTT and OpTune achieve superior scalability and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Euntae Choi, Sumin Song, Woosang Lim, Sungjoo Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong W. Xu, Wenhao Li, Scott Sanner, Elias B. Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a Transformer-based framework for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). CSPs find use in many applications and thus accelerating their solution with machine learning is of wide interest. Most existing approaches rely on supervised learning from feasible solutions or reinforcement learning, paradigms that require either feasible solutions to these NP-Complete CSPs or large training budgets and a complex expert-designed reward signal. To address these challenges, we propose ConsFormer, a self-supervised framework that leverages a Transformer as a solution refiner. ConsFormer constructs a solution to a CSP iteratively in a process that mimics local search. Instead of using feasible solutions as labeled data, we devise differentiable approximations to the discrete constraints of a CSP to guide model training. Our model is trained to improve random assignments for a single step but is deployed iteratively at test time, circumventing the bottlenecks of supervised and reinforcement learning. Our method can tackle out-of-distribution CSPs simply through additional iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Willy Chan, Michael Souliman, Jakob Nordhagen, Brando Miranda, Elyas Obbad, Kai Fronsdal Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical language into formal specifications and proofs remains a difficult task for state-of-the-art (large) language models. Existing works point to competing explanations for the performance gap. To this end, we introduce a novel methodology that leverages back-translation with hand-curated prompts to enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models, particularly addressing the challenge posed by the scarcity of labeled data. Specifically, we evaluate three primary variations of this strategy: (1) on-the-fly (online) backtranslation, (2) distilled (offline) backtranslation with few-shot amplification, and (3) line-by-line proof analysis integrated with proof state information. Each variant is designed to optimize data quality over quantity, focusing on the high fidelity of generated proofs rather than sheer data scale. Our findings provide evidence that employing our proposed approaches to generate synthetic data, which prioritizes quality over volume, improves the Autoformalization performance of LLMs as measured by standard benchmarks such as ProofNet. Crucially, our approach outperforms pretrained models using a minimal number of tokens. We also show, through strategic prompting and backtranslation, that our approaches surpass the performance of fine-tuning with extensive multilingual datasets such as MMA on ProofNet with only 1/150th of the tokens. Taken together, our methods show a promising new approach to significantly reduce the resources required to formalize proofs, thereby accelerating AI for math.</p>

Although transformer-based large language models can exhibit strong performance on certain compositional tasks, the underlying mechanisms driving these abilities remain opaque, calling into question their interpretability. In this work, we identify and mechanistically interpret the circuit responsible for compositional induction in a compact transformer. Using causal ablations, we validate the circuit and formalize its operation using a program-like description. We further demonstrate that this mechanistic understanding enables precise activation edits to steer the model's behavior predictably. Our findings advance the understanding of complex behaviors in transformers and highlight such insights can provide a direct pathway for model control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yao, Xuan Tong, Ruofan Wang, Yixu Wang, Lujundong Li, Liang Liu, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, claude-sonnet and gemini-thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking claude-sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively. Attention: This paper contains inappropriate, offensive and harmful content.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for automating hardware description language (HDL) code generation from high-level natural language instructions. While fine-tuning has improved LLMs' performance in hardware design tasks, prior efforts have largely focused on Verilog generation, overlooking the equally critical task of Verilog understanding. Furthermore, existing models suffer from weak alignment between natural language descriptions and Verilog code, hindering the generation of high-quality, synthesizable designs. To address these issues, we present DeepRTL, a unified representation model that excels in both Verilog understanding and generation. Based on CodeT5+, DeepRTL is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset that aligns Verilog code with rich, multi-level natural language descriptions. We also introduce the first benchmark for Verilog understanding and take the initiative to apply embedding similarity and GPT Score to evaluate the models' understanding capabilities. These metrics capture semantic similarity more accurately than traditional methods like BLEU and ROUGE, which are limited to surface-level n-gram overlaps. By adapting curriculum learning to train DeepRTL, we enable it to significantly outperform GPT-4 in Verilog understanding tasks, while achieving performance on par with OpenAI's o1-preview model in Verilog generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face significant performance gaps when applied to technical domains requiring precise information extraction from complex documents. Current evaluation methodologies relying on document-level metrics inadequately capture token-resolution retrieval accuracy that is critical for domain-related documents. We propose a framework combining granular evaluation metrics with synthetic data generation to optimize domain-specific RAG performance. First, we introduce token-aware metrics Precision $\Omega$ and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) that quantify context preservation versus information density trade-offs inherent in technical texts. Second, we develop a reasoning model-driven pipeline using instruction-tuned LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1 distilled variants, and Phi-4) to generate context-anchored QA pairs with discontinuous reference spans across three specialized corpora: SEC 10-K filings (finance), biomedical abstracts (PubMed), and APT threat reports (cybersecurity).
  Our empirical analysis reveals critical insights: smaller chunks (less than 10 tokens) improve precision by 31-42% (IoU = 0.071 vs. baseline 0.053) at recall costs (-18%), while domain-specific embedding strategies yield 22% variance in optimal chunk sizing (5-20 tokens). The DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model demonstrates superior concept alignment (+14% mean IoU over alternatives), though no configuration universally dominates. Financial texts favor larger chunks for risk factor coverage (Recall = 0.81 at size = 20), whereas cybersecurity content benefits from atomic segmentation, Precision $\Omega = 0.28$ at size = 5.

By analyzing principles from AI and psychology, we found that positively framed, behavior-based principles align more closely with human preferences than negatively framed or trait-based principles. In a safety alignment use case, we applied a graph-based principle selection method to refine an existing CAI constitution, improving safety measures while maintaining strong general reasoning capabilities. Interestingly, fine-tuned CAI models performed well on negatively framed principles but struggled with positively framed ones, in contrast to our human alignment results. This highlights a potential gap between principle design and model adherence. Overall, C3AI provides a structured and scalable approach to both crafting and evaluating CAI constitutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Chen, Jiaao Chen, Jianda Chen, Misha Sra</p>
<p>Abstract: Current financial LLM agent benchmarks are inadequate. They prioritize task performance while ignoring fundamental safety risks. Threats like hallucinations, temporal misalignment, and adversarial vulnerabilities pose systemic risks in high-stakes financial environments, yet existing evaluation frameworks fail to capture these risks. We take a firm position: traditional benchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance. To address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding safety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an empirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal hidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To move the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA), grounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the model level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process reliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight the urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the focus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Junjiao Tian, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Yushi Feng, Changyang He, Yue Deng, Hongxi Pu, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide explainable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and a Distinguisher that examines how well the input texts align with the predicted prompts. We develop and examine two versions of Distinguishers. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that both Distinguishers perform significantly better than the baseline methods, with version2 outperforming baselines by 9.73% on in-distribution data (F1-score) and 12.65% on OOD data (AUROC). Furthermore, a user study is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of AI techniques has become increasingly popular in software development, enhancing performance, usability, and the availability of intelligent features. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, developers now have access to a wealth of high-quality open-source models and APIs from closed-source providers, enabling easier experimentation and integration of LLMs into various systems. This has also opened new possibilities in mobile application (app) development, allowing for more personalized and intelligent apps. However, integrating LLM into mobile apps might present unique challenges for developers, particularly regarding mobile device constraints, API management, and code infrastructure. In this project, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 149 LLM-enabled Android apps and conducted an exploratory analysis to understand how LLMs are deployed and used within mobile apps. This analysis highlights key characteristics of the dataset, prevalent integration strategies, and common challenges developers face. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research and tooling development aimed at enhancing LLM-enabled mobile apps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shane Bergsma, Nolan Dey, Gurpreet Gosal, Gavia Gray, Daria Soboleva, Joel Hestness</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are commonly trained with a learning rate (LR) warmup, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the maximum (10x decay). In a large-scale empirical study, we show that under an optimal peak LR, a simple linear decay-to-zero (D2Z) schedule consistently outperforms other schedules when training at compute-optimal dataset sizes. D2Z is superior across a range of model sizes, batch sizes, datasets, and vocabularies. Benefits increase as dataset size increases. Leveraging a novel interpretation of AdamW as an exponential moving average of weight updates, we show how linear D2Z optimally balances the demands of early training (moving away from initial conditions) and late training (averaging over more updates in order to mitigate gradient noise). In experiments, a 610M-parameter model trained for 80 tokens-per-parameter (TPP) using D2Z achieves lower loss than when trained for 200 TPP using 10x decay, corresponding to an astonishing 60% compute savings. Models such as Llama2-7B, trained for 286 TPP with 10x decay, could likely have saved a majority of compute by training with D2Z.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lior Belenki, Alekh Agarwal, Tianze Shi, Kristina Toutanova</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to optimize language model pre-training data mixtures through efficient approximation of the cross-entropy loss corresponding to each candidate mixture via a Mixture of Data Experts (MDE). We use this approximation as a source of additional features in a regression model, trained from observations of model loss for a small number of mixtures.
  Experiments with Transformer decoder-only language models in the range of 70M to 1B parameters on the SlimPajama dataset show that our method achieves significantly better performance than approaches that train regression models using only the mixture rates as input features. Combining this improved optimization method with an objective that takes into account cross-entropy on end task data leads to superior performance on few-shot downstream evaluations.
  We also provide theoretical insights on why aggregation of data expert predictions can provide good approximations to model losses for data mixtures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avanika Narayan, Dan Biderman, Sabri Eyuboglu, Avner May, Scott Linderman, James Zou, Christopher Re</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate an emerging setup in which a small, on-device language model (LM) with access to local data communicates with a frontier, cloud-hosted LM to solve real-world tasks involving financial, medical, and scientific reasoning over long documents. Can a local-remote collaboration reduce cloud inference costs while preserving quality? First, we consider a naive collaboration protocol where the local and remote models simply chat back and forth. Because only the local model reads the full context, this protocol achieves a 30.4x reduction in remote costs, but recovers only 87% of the performance of the frontier model. We identify two key limitations of this protocol: the local model struggles to (1) follow the remote model's multi-step instructions and (2) reason over long contexts. Motivated by these observations, we study an extension of this protocol, coined MinionS, in which the remote model decomposes the task into easier subtasks over shorter chunks of the document, that are executed locally in parallel. MinionS reduces costs by 5.7x on average while recovering 97.9% of the performance of the remote model alone. Our analysis reveals several key design choices that influence the trade-off between cost and performance in local-remote systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Rudman, Michal Golovanesky, Amir Bar, Vedant Palit, Yann LeCun, Carsten Eickhoff, Ritambhara Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Liu, Zhaocheng Du, Haiyuan Zhao, Wenbo Zhang, Xiaoyan Zhao, Gang Wang, Zhenhua Dong, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have become a powerful method for feature augmentation in recommendation systems. However, existing approaches relying on quick inference often suffer from incomplete feature coverage and insufficient specificity in feature descriptions, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and undermining overall performance. Motivated by the recent success of inference scaling in math and coding tasks, we explore whether scaling inference can address these limitations and enhance feature quality.
  Our experiments show that scaling inference leads to significant improvements in recommendation performance, with a 12% increase in NDCG@10. The gains can be attributed to two key factors: feature quantity and specificity. In particular, models using extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning generate a greater number of detailed and precise features, offering deeper insights into user preferences and overcoming the limitations of quick inference. We further investigate the factors influencing feature quantity, revealing that model choice and search strategy play critical roles in generating a richer and more diverse feature set. This is the first work to apply inference scaling to feature augmentation in recommendation systems, bridging advances in reasoning tasks to enhance personalized recommendation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent agent frameworks and inference-time algorithms often struggle with complex planning problems due to limitations in verifying generated plans or reasoning and varying complexity of instances within a single task. Many existing methods for these tasks either perform task-level verification without considering constraints or apply inference-time algorithms without adapting to instance-level complexity. To address these limitations, we propose PlanGEN, a model-agnostic and easily scalable agent framework with three key components: constraint, verification, and selection agents. Specifically, our approach proposes constraint-guided iterative verification to enhance performance of inference-time algorithms--Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE. In PlanGEN framework, the selection agent optimizes algorithm choice based on instance complexity, ensuring better adaptability to complex planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the strongest baseline across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on NATURAL PLAN ($\sim$8%$\uparrow$), OlympiadBench ($\sim$4%$\uparrow$), DocFinQA ($\sim$7%$\uparrow$), and GPQA ($\sim$1%$\uparrow$). Our key finding highlights that constraint-guided iterative verification improves inference-time algorithms, and adaptive selection further boosts performance on complex planning and reasoning problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenwen Yu, Zhibo Yang, Jianqiang Wan, Sibo Song, Jun Tang, Wenqing Cheng, Yuliang Liu, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Visually-situated text parsing (VsTP) has recently seen notable advancements, driven by the growing demand for automated document understanding and the emergence of large language models capable of processing document-based questions. While various methods have been proposed to tackle the complexities of VsTP, existing solutions often rely on task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks. This leads to modal isolation and complex workflows due to the diversified targets and heterogeneous schemas. In this paper, we introduce OmniParser V2, a universal model that unifies VsTP typical tasks, including text spotting, key information extraction, table recognition, and layout analysis, into a unified framework. Central to our approach is the proposed Structured-Points-of-Thought (SPOT) prompting schemas, which improves model performance across diverse scenarios by leveraging a unified encoder-decoder architecture, objective, and input\&output representation. SPOT eliminates the need for task-specific architectures and loss functions, significantly simplifying the processing pipeline. Our extensive evaluations across four tasks on eight different datasets show that OmniParser V2 achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results in VsTP. Additionally, we explore the integration of SPOT within a multimodal large language model structure, further enhancing text localization and recognition capabilities, thereby confirming the generality of SPOT prompting technique.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej Chrab\k{a}szcz, Filip Szatkowski, Bartosz W\'ojcik, Jan Dubi\'nski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of the Large Language Model (LLM) is critical, but currently used methods in most cases sacrifice the model performance to obtain increased safety or perform poorly on data outside of their adaptation distribution. We investigate existing methods for such generalization and find them insufficient. Surprisingly, while even plain LLMs recognize unsafe prompts, they may still generate unsafe responses. To avoid performance degradation and preserve safe performance, we advocate for a two-step framework, where we first identify unsafe prompts via a lightweight classifier, and apply a "safe" model only to such prompts. In particular, we explore the design of the safety detector in more detail, investigating the use of different classifier architectures and prompting techniques. Interestingly, we find that the final hidden state for the last token is enough to provide robust performance, minimizing false positives on benign data while performing well on malicious prompt detection. Additionally, we show that classifiers trained on the representations from different model layers perform comparably on the latest model layers, indicating that safety representation is present in the LLMs' hidden states at most model stages. Our work is a step towards efficient, representation-based safety mechanisms for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johnny Tian-Zheng Wei, Maggie Wang, Ameya Godbole, Jonathan H. Choi, Robin Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: The current discourse on large language models (LLMs) and copyright largely takes a "behavioral" perspective, focusing on model outputs and evaluating whether they are substantially similar to training data. However, substantial similarity is difficult to define algorithmically and a narrow focus on model outputs is insufficient to address all copyright risks. In this interdisciplinary work, we take a complementary "structural" perspective and shift our focus to how LLMs are trained. We operationalize a notion of "fair learning" by measuring whether any training decision substantially affected the model's memorization. As a case study, we deconstruct Pythia, an open-source LLM, and demonstrate the use of causal and correlational analyses to make factual determinations about Pythia's training decisions. By proposing a legal standard for fair learning and connecting memorization analyses to this standard, we identify how judges may advance the goals of copyright law through adjudication. Finally, we discuss how a fair learning standard might evolve to enhance its clarity by becoming more rule-like and incorporating external technical guidelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek N. Kulkarni, Andy Liu, Jean-Raphael Gaglione, Daniel Fried, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: In strategic multi-agent sequential interactions, detecting dynamic coalition structures is crucial for understanding how self-interested agents coordinate to influence outcomes. However, natural-language-based interactions introduce unique challenges to coalition detection due to ambiguity over intents and difficulty in modeling players' subjective perspectives. We propose a new method that leverages recent advancements in large language models and game theory to predict dynamic multilateral coalition formation in Diplomacy, a strategic multi-agent game where agents negotiate coalitions using natural language. The method consists of two stages. The first stage extracts the set of agreements discussed by two agents in their private dialogue, by combining a parsing-based filtering function with a fine-tuned language model trained to predict player intents. In the second stage, we define a new metric using the concept of subjective rationalizability from hypergame theory to evaluate the expected value of an agreement for each player. We then compute this metric for each agreement identified in the first stage by assessing the strategic value of the agreement for both players and taking into account the subjective belief of one player that the second player would honor the agreement. We demonstrate that our method effectively detects potential coalition structures in online Diplomacy gameplay by assigning high values to agreements likely to be honored and low values to those likely to be violated. The proposed method provides foundational insights into coalition formation in multi-agent environments with language-based negotiation and offers key directions for future research on the analysis of complex natural language-based interactions between agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Nguyen, Yan Leng</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of LLMs. Park et al. (2024) formalize this notion by unifying multiple interpretations of linear representation, such as 1-dimensional subspace representation and interventions, using a causal inner product. However, their framework relies on single-token counterfactual pairs and cannot handle ambiguous contrasting pairs, limiting its applicability to complex or context-dependent concepts. We introduce a new notion of binary concepts as unit vectors in a canonical representation space, and utilize LLMs' (neural) activation differences along with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to compute concept directions (i.e., steering vectors). Our method, Sum of Activation-base Normalized Difference (SAND), formalizes the use of activation differences modeled as samples from a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, providing a principled approach to derive concept directions. We extend the applicability of Park et al. (2024) by eliminating the dependency on unembedding representations and single-token pairs. Through experiments with LLaMA models across diverse concepts and benchmarks, we demonstrate that our lightweight approach offers greater flexibility, superior performance in activation engineering tasks like monitoring and manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for data science tasks via code generation. However, the exploratory nature of data science, alongside the stochastic and opaque outputs of LLMs, raise concerns about their reliability. While prior work focuses on benchmarking LLM accuracy, reproducibility remains underexplored, despite being critical to establishing trust in LLM-driven analysis.
  We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions.
  Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies. Our results show that higher reproducibility strongly correlates with improved accuracy and reproducibility-enhancing prompts are effective, demonstrating structured prompting's potential to enhance automated data science workflows and enable transparent, robust AI-driven analysis.

To address this, we propose Ensemble Tree-of-Thought (ToT), a framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating multiple models. Using this framework, we develop a grading system. Ensemble ToT follows three steps: (1) analyzing LLM performance, (2) generating candidate answers, and (3) refining them into a final result. Based on this, our grading system first evaluates the grading tendencies of LLMs, then generates multiple results, and finally integrates them via a simulated debate. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's ability to provide accurate and explainable grading by effectively coordinating multiple LLMs.</p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce VisFactor, a novel benchmark derived from the Factor-Referenced Cognitive Test (FRCT), a well-established psychometric assessment of human cognition. VisFactor digitalizes vision-related FRCT subtests to systematically evaluate MLLMs across essential visual cognitive tasks including spatial reasoning, perceptual speed, and pattern recognition. We present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Qwen-VL, using VisFactor under diverse prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Multi-Agent Debate. Our findings reveal a concerning deficiency in current MLLMs' fundamental visual cognition, with performance frequently approaching random guessing and showing only marginal improvements even with advanced prompting techniques. These results underscore the critical need for focused research to enhance the core visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. To foster further investigation in this area, we release our VisFactor benchmark at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/VisFactor.</p>

We focus specifically on the interface between emotion and rumours in threaded discourses, building on the surprisingly sparse literature on the topic which has largely focused on emotions within the original rumour posts themselves, and largely overlooked the comparative differences between rumours and non-rumours. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytical emotion framework, contrasting rumour and non-rumour cases using existing NLP datasets to further understand the emotion dynamics within rumours. Our framework reveals several findings: rumours exhibit more negative sentiment and emotions, including anger, fear and pessimism, while non-rumours evoke more positive emotions; emotions are contagious in online interactions, with rumours facilitate negative emotions and non-rumours foster positive emotions; and based on causal analysis, surprise acts as a bridge between rumours and other emotions, pessimism is driven by sadness and fear, optimism by joy and love.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengqing Wu, Takayuki Ito</p>
<p>Abstract: Consensus formation is pivotal in multi-agent systems (MAS), balancing collective coherence with individual diversity. Conventional LLM-based MAS primarily rely on explicit coordination, e.g., prompts or voting, risking premature homogenization. We argue that implicit consensus, where agents exchange information yet independently form decisions via in-context learning, can be more effective in dynamic environments that require long-horizon adaptability. By retaining partial diversity, systems can better explore novel strategies and cope with external shocks. We formalize a consensus-diversity tradeoff, showing conditions where implicit methods outperform explicit ones. Experiments on three scenarios -- Dynamic Disaster Response, Information Spread and Manipulation, and Dynamic Public-Goods Provision -- confirm partial deviation from group norms boosts exploration, robustness, and performance. We highlight emergent coordination via in-context learning, underscoring the value of preserving diversity for resilient decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in audio tokenization have significantly enhanced the integration of audio capabilities into large language models (LLMs). However, audio understanding and generation are often treated as distinct tasks, hindering the development of truly unified audio-language models. While instruction tuning has demonstrated remarkable success in improving generalization and zero-shot learning across text and vision, its application to audio remains largely unexplored. A major obstacle is the lack of comprehensive datasets that unify audio understanding and generation. To address this, we introduce Audio-FLAN, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset covering 80 diverse tasks across speech, music, and sound domains, with over 100 million instances. Audio-FLAN lays the foundation for unified audio-language models that can seamlessly handle both understanding (e.g., transcription, comprehension) and generation (e.g., speech, music, sound) tasks across a wide range of audio domains in a zero-shot manner. The Audio-FLAN dataset is available on HuggingFace and GitHub and will be continuously updated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qipan Xu, Zhenting Wang, Xiaoxiao He, Ligong Han, Ruixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI models, renowned for their ability to synthesize high-quality content, have sparked growing concerns over the improper generation of copyright-protected material. While recent studies have proposed various approaches to address copyright issues, the capability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect copyright infringements remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on evaluating the copyright detection abilities of state-of-the-art LVLMs using a various set of image samples. Recognizing the absence of a comprehensive dataset that includes both IP-infringement samples and ambiguous non-infringement negative samples, we construct a benchmark dataset comprising positive samples that violate the copyright protection of well-known IP figures, as well as negative samples that resemble these figures but do not raise copyright concerns. This dataset is created using advanced prompt engineering techniques. We then evaluate leading LVLMs using our benchmark dataset. Our experimental results reveal that LVLMs are prone to overfitting, leading to the misclassification of some negative samples as IP-infringement cases. In the final section, we analyze these failure cases and propose potential solutions to mitigate the overfitting problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Long, Zhiyuan Ma, Ermo Hua, Kaiyan Zhang, Biqing Qi, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged to address the knowledge-intensive visual question answering (VQA) task. Current methods mainly employ separate retrieval and generation modules to acquire external knowledge and generate answers, respectively. We propose ReAuSE, an alternative to the previous RAG model for the knowledge-based VQA task, which seamlessly integrates knowledge retriever into the generative multi-modal large language model, serving as a built-in search engine. Specifically, our model functions both as a generative retriever and an accurate answer generator. It not only helps retrieve documents from the knowledge base by producing identifiers for each document, but it also answers visual questions based on the retrieved documents. Furthermore, we propose a reinforced retrieval calibration module from relevance feedback to improve retrieval performance and align with the preferences for accurate answer generation. Extensive experiments on two representative OKVQA and A-OKVQA datasets demonstrate significant improvements ranging from 2.9\% to 9.6\% across all evaluation metrics when compared to strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Light, Wei Cheng, Wu Yue, Masafumi Oyamada, Mengdi Wang, Santiago Paternain, Haifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many inference scaling methods work by breaking a problem into smaller steps (or groups of tokens), then sampling and choosing the best next step. However, these steps and their sizes are usually predetermined based on human intuition or domain knowledge. This paper introduces dynamic decomposition, a method that automatically and adaptively splits solution and reasoning traces into steps during inference. This approach improves computational efficiency by focusing more resources on difficult steps, breaking them down further and prioritizing their sampling. Experiments on coding and math benchmarks (APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench) show that dynamic decomposition performs better than static methods, which rely on fixed steps like token-level, sentence-level, or single-step decompositions. These results suggest that dynamic decomposition can enhance many inference scaling techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Golowich, Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, Sham M. Kakade, Eran Malach</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models to predict beyond their training context lengths has drawn much attention in recent years, yet the principles driving such behavior of length generalization remain underexplored. We propose a new theoretical framework to study length generalization for the next-token prediction task, as performed by decoder-only transformers. Conceptually, we show that length generalization occurs as long as each predicted token depends on a small (fixed) number of previous tokens. We formalize such tasks via a notion we call $k$-sparse planted correlation distributions, and show that an idealized model of transformers which generalize attention heads successfully length-generalize on such tasks. As a bonus, our theoretical model justifies certain techniques to modify positional embeddings which have been introduced to improve length generalization, such as position coupling.
  We support our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic tasks and natural language, which confirm that a key factor driving length generalization is a ``sparse'' dependency structure of each token on the previous ones. Inspired by our theory, we introduce Predictive Position Coupling, which trains the transformer to predict the position IDs used in a positional coupling approach. Predictive Position Coupling thereby allows us to broaden the array of tasks to which position coupling can successfully be applied to achieve length generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Vishal Choudhari, Stephan Bickel, Ashesh Mehta, Guy M McKhann, Adeen Flinker, Daniel Friedman, Nima Mesgarani</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Liu, Hongda Sun, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bo Du, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile phone agents can assist people in automating daily tasks on their phones, which have emerged as a pivotal research spotlight. However, existing procedure-oriented agents struggle with cross-app instructions, due to the following challenges: (1) complex task relationships, (2) diverse app environment, and (3) error propagation and information loss in multi-step execution. Drawing inspiration from object-oriented programming principles, we recognize that object-oriented solutions is more suitable for cross-app instruction. To address these challenges, we propose a self-evolving multi-agent framework named MobileSteward, which integrates multiple app-oriented StaffAgents coordinated by a centralized StewardAgent. We design three specialized modules in MobileSteward: (1) Dynamic Recruitment generates a scheduling graph guided by information flow to explicitly associate tasks among apps. (2) Assigned Execution assigns the task to app-oriented StaffAgents, each equipped with app-specialized expertise to address the diversity between apps. (3) Adjusted Evaluation conducts evaluation to provide reflection tips or deliver key information, which alleviates error propagation and information loss during multi-step execution. To continuously improve the performance of MobileSteward, we develop a Memory-based Self-evolution mechanism, which summarizes the experience from successful execution, to improve the performance of MobileSteward. We establish the first English Cross-APP Benchmark (CAPBench) in the real-world environment to evaluate the agents' capabilities of solving complex cross-app instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that MobileSteward achieves the best performance compared to both single-agent and multi-agent frameworks, highlighting the superiority of MobileSteward in better handling user instructions with diverse complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin. Our findings suggest a promising LLM-based agentic framework to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring responsible generation using only facts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zhang, Dian Yu, Tao Ge, Linfeng Song, Zhichen Zeng, Haitao Mi, Nan Jiang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Many existing alignment approaches rely on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which assumes the existence of a ground-truth reward for each prompt-response pair. However, this assumption can be overly restrictive when modeling complex human preferences. In this paper, we drop the BT model assumption and study LLM alignment under general preferences, formulated as a two-player game. Drawing on theoretical insights from learning in games, we integrate optimistic online mirror descent into our alignment framework to approximate the Nash policy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an $O(T^{-1})$ bound on the duality gap, improving upon the previous $O(T^{-1/2})$ result. More importantly, we implement our method and show through experiments that it outperforms state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms across multiple representative benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amelia Taylor, Amoss Robert</p>
<p>Abstract: SMS enabled fraud is of great concern globally. Building classifiers based on machine learning for SMS fraud requires the use of suitable datasets for model training and validation. Most research has centred on the use of datasets of SMSs in English. This paper introduces a first dataset for SMS fraud detection in Chichewa, a major language in Africa, and reports on experiments with machine learning algorithms for classifying SMSs in Chichewa as fraud or non-fraud. We answer the broader research question of how feasible it is to develop machine learning classification models for Chichewa SMSs. To do that, we created three datasets. A small dataset of SMS in Chichewa was collected through primary research from a segment of the young population. We applied a label-preserving text transformations to increase its size. The enlarged dataset was translated into English using two approaches: human translation and machine translation. The Chichewa and the translated datasets were subjected to machine classification using random forest and logistic regression. Our findings indicate that both models achieved a promising accuracy of over 96% on the Chichewa dataset. There was a drop in performance when moving from the Chichewa to the translated dataset. This highlights the importance of data preprocessing, especially in multilingual or cross-lingual NLP tasks, and shows the challenges of relying on machine-translated text for training machine learning models. Our results underscore the importance of developing language specific models for SMS fraud detection to optimise accuracy and performance. Since most machine learning models require data preprocessing, it is essential to investigate the impact of the reliance on English-specific tools for data preprocessing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Saidul Hoque Anik, Ariful Azad</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) learning offers a powerful framework for generating new knowledge and making inferences. Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can also be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the Muon optimizer based on matrix orthogonalization has demonstrated strong results in training small-scale language models, but the scalability to larger models has not been proven. We identify two crucial techniques for scaling up Muon: (1) adding weight decay and (2) carefully adjusting the per-parameter update scale. These techniques allow Muon to work out-of-the-box on large-scale training without the need of hyper-parameter tuning. Scaling law experiments indicate that Muon achieves $\sim\!2\times$ computational efficiency compared to AdamW with compute optimal training.
  Based on these improvements, we introduce Moonlight, a 3B/16B-parameter Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model trained with 5.7T tokens using Muon. Our model improves the current Pareto frontier, achieving better performance with much fewer training FLOPs compared to prior models.
  We open-source our distributed Muon implementation that is memory optimal and communication efficient. We also release the pretrained, instruction-tuned, and intermediate checkpoints to support future research.</p>

We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for evaluating feature-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes for the misalignment of feature and their description. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions, and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs as compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability.

<p>Abstract: Financial bond yield forecasting is challenging due to data scarcity, nonlinear macroeconomic dependencies, and evolving market conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Causal Generative Adversarial Networks (CausalGANs) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning (RL) to generate high-fidelity synthetic bond yield data for four major bond categories (AAA, BAA, US10Y, Junk). By incorporating 12 key macroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential market properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into actionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM) Qwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments, and volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of which demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over existing methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE evaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation (3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement learning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute Error of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond market dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also provides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk & volatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a bridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and language model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the effects of economic shocks on firms is critical for analyzing economic growth and resilience. We introduce a Web-Based Affectedness Indicator (WAI), a general-purpose tool for real-time monitoring of economic disruptions across diverse contexts. By leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) assisted classification and information extraction on texts from over five million company websites, WAI quantifies the degree and nature of firms' responses to external shocks. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific application, we show that WAI is highly correlated with pandemic containment measures and reliably predicts firm performance. Unlike traditional data sources, WAI provides timely firm-level information across industries and geographies worldwide that would otherwise be unavailable due to institutional and data availability constraints. This methodology offers significant potential for monitoring and mitigating the impact of technological, political, financial, health or environmental crises, and represents a transformative tool for adaptive policy-making and economic resilience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Beiser, David Penz</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning tasks manifest themselves as a challenge to Large Language Models (LLMs). Neurosymbolic approaches use LLMs to translate logical reasoning problems formulated in natural language into a formal intermediate language. Subsequently, the usage of symbolic reasoners yields reliable solving thereof. However, LLMs often fail in translation due to poorly chosen intermediate languages.
  We introduce the intermediate language problem, which is the problem of choosing a suitable formal language representation for neurosymbolic approaches. Theoretically, we argue that its origins lie in the inability of LLMs to distinguish syntax from semantics and the relative independence of the problem from its representation. We showcase its existence experimentally by contrasting two intermediate languages, Answer Set Programming and the Python Knowledge Engine. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of varying degrees of supplementary context information. Our results show a maximum difference in overall-accuracy of 53.20% and 49.26% in execution-accuracy. When using the GPT4o-mini LLM we beat the state-of-the-art in overall-accuracy on the ProntoQA dataset by 21.20% and by 50.50% on the ProofWriter dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language diversity presents a significant challenge in speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, such as automatic speech recognition and translation. Traditional multi-task training approaches aim to address this by jointly optimizing multiple speech recognition and translation tasks across various languages. While models like Whisper, built on these strategies, demonstrate strong performance, they still face issues of high computational cost, language interference, suboptimal training configurations, and limited extensibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LoRS-Merging (low-rank and sparse model merging), a novel technique designed to efficiently integrate models trained on different languages or tasks while preserving performance and reducing computational overhead. LoRS-Merging combines low-rank and sparse pruning to retain essential structures while eliminating redundant parameters, mitigating language and task interference, and enhancing extensibility. Experimental results across a range of languages demonstrate that LoRS-Merging significantly outperforms conventional multi-lingual multi-task training baselines. Our findings suggest that model merging, particularly LoRS-Merging, is a scalable and effective complement to traditional multi-lingual training strategies for S2T applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Increasing interest in reasoning models has led math to become a prominent testing ground for algorithmic and methodological improvements. However, existing open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality, human-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of uncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity. In this work, we present Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math questions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning (RL). To create Big-Math, we rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly available datasets, extracting questions that satisfy our three desiderata: (1) problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended, (3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of Big-Math, we manually verify each step in our filtering process. Based on the findings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with verified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple choice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a systematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing open-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order of magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the questions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the dataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across problem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties, enabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and training requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity, Big-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangshijie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in the field of natural language processing (NLP), leading to widely recognized applications such as ChatGPT. However, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. Unlike continuous domains like images, text exists in a discrete space, making even minor alterations at the sentence, word, or character level easily perceptible to humans. This inherent discreteness also complicates the use of conventional optimization techniques, as text is non-differentiable. Previous research on adversarial attacks in text has focused on character-level, word-level, sentence-level, and multi-level approaches, all of which suffer from inefficiency or perceptibility issues due to the need for multiple queries or significant semantic shifts.
  In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial attack method, Emoji-Attack, which leverages the manipulation of emojis to create subtle, yet effective, perturbations. Unlike character- and word-level strategies, Emoji-Attack targets emojis as a distinct layer of attack, resulting in less noticeable changes with minimal disruption to the text. This approach has been largely unexplored in previous research, which typically focuses on emoji insertion as an extension of character-level attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that Emoji-Attack achieves strong attack performance on both large and small models, making it a promising technique for enhancing adversarial robustness in NLP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Hegselmann, Georg von Arnim, Tillmann Rheude, Noel Kronenberg, David Sontag, Gerhard Hindricks, Roland Eils, Benjamin Wild</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer rich potential for clinical prediction, yet their inherent complexity and heterogeneity pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large collections of unlabeled EHR data have demonstrated promising improvements in predictive accuracy and generalization; however, their training is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets and inconsistencies in coding standards and healthcare practices. In this study, we explore the possibility of using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) based embedding methods as EHR encoders. By serializing patient records into structured Markdown text, transforming codes into human-readable descriptors, we leverage the extensive generalization capabilities of LLMs pretrained on vast public corpora, thereby bypassing the need for proprietary medical datasets. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art LLM-embedding models, GTE-Qwen2-7B-Instruct and LLM2Vec-Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, across 15 diverse clinical prediction tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark, comparing their performance to an EHRspecific foundation model, CLIMBR-T-Base, and traditional machine learning baselines. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based embeddings frequently match or exceed the performance of specialized models, even in few-shot settings, and that their effectiveness scales with the size of the underlying LLM and the available context window. Overall, our findings demonstrate that repurposing LLMs for EHR encoding offers a scalable and effective approach for clinical prediction, capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional EHR modeling and facilitating more interoperable and generalizable healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Wollschl\"ager, Jannes Elstner, Simon Geisler, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Stephan G\"unnemann, Johannes Gasteiger</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) can be circumvented through adversarially crafted inputs, yet the mechanisms by which these attacks bypass safety barriers remain poorly understood. Prior work suggests that a single refusal direction in the model's activation space determines whether an LLM refuses a request. In this study, we propose a novel gradient-based approach to representation engineering and use it to identify refusal directions. Contrary to prior work, we uncover multiple independent directions and even multi-dimensional concept cones that mediate refusal. Moreover, we show that orthogonality alone does not imply independence under intervention, motivating the notion of representational independence that accounts for both linear and non-linear effects. Using this framework, we identify mechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms in LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally independent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive refusal behavior. Our gradient-based approach uncovers these mechanisms and can further serve as a foundation for future work on understanding LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Zhang, Mahyar Khayatkhoei, Prateek Chhikara, Filip Ilievski</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid progress in visual recognition tasks in recent years. Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Betley, Daniel Tan, Niels Warncke, Anna Sztyber-Betley, Xuchan Bao, Mart\'in Soto, Nathan Labenz, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.
  Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.
  In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.
  It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Hoyle, Rupak Sarkar, Pranav Goel, Philip Resnik</p>
<p>Abstract: When people interpret text, they rely on inferences that go beyond the observed language itself. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a method for the analysis of text that takes implicitly communicated content explicitly into account. We use a large language model to produce sets of propositions that are inferentially related to the text that has been observed, then validate the plausibility of the generated content via human judgments. Incorporating these explicit representations of implicit content proves useful in multiple problem settings that involve the human interpretation of utterances: assessing the similarity of arguments, making sense of a body of opinion data, and modeling legislative behavior. Our results suggest that modeling the meanings behind observed language, rather than the literal text alone, is a valuable direction for NLP and particularly its applications to social science.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in natural language processing, they still struggle with long-context comprehension. Traditional approaches to mitigating this issue typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining, which is both resource-intensive and challenging to deploy in lightweight industrial settings. In this paper, we investigate the potential to accomplish this without any additional resources. Through an in-depth study of the attention mechanism in LLMs, we propose a method called Scaled ReAttention (SRA) to strengthen LLMs' ability to interpret and retrieve information by strategically manipulating their attention scores during inference. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that integrating SRA significantly boosts LLMs' performance on a variety of downstream tasks, highlighting its practical potential for enhancing language understanding without incurring the overhead of traditional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Ye, Zaixiang Zheng, Yu Bao, Lihua Qian, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge of generative AI has been fueled by the generative power of diffusion probabilistic models and the scalable capabilities of large language models. Despite their potential, it remains elusive whether diffusion language models can solve general language tasks comparable to their autoregressive counterparts. This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks. We further discover that instruction finetuning can elicit zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning abilities that help tackle many unseen tasks by following natural language instructions, and show promise in advanced and challenging abilities such as reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating responses based on human instructions. However, their use in the medical field can be challenging due to their lack of specific, in-depth knowledge. In this study, we present a system called LLMs Augmented with Medical Textbooks (LLM-AMT) designed to enhance the proficiency of LLMs in specialized domains. LLM-AMT integrates authoritative medical textbooks into the LLMs' framework using plug-and-play modules. These modules include a Query Augmenter, a Hybrid Textbook Retriever, and a Knowledge Self-Refiner. Together, they incorporate authoritative medical knowledge. Additionally, an LLM Reader aids in contextual understanding. Our experimental results on three medical QA tasks demonstrate that LLMAMT significantly improves response quality, with accuracy gains ranging from 11.6% to 16.6%. Notably, with GPT-4-Turbo as the base model, LLM-AMT outperforms the specialized Med-PaLM 2 model pre-trained on a massive amount of medical corpus by 2-3%. We found that despite being 100x smaller in size, medical textbooks as a retrieval corpus is proven to be a more effective knowledge database than Wikipedia in the medical domain, boosting performance by 7.8%-13.7%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide spectrum of tasks; however, they still face limitations in scenarios that demand long-term planning and spatial reasoning. To facilitate this line of research, in this work, we propose a new benchmark, termed $\textbf{P}$ath $\textbf{P}$lanning from $\textbf{N}$atural $\textbf{L}$anguage ($\textbf{PPNL}$). Our benchmark evaluates LLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning by formulating ''path planning'' tasks that require an LLM to navigate to target locations while avoiding obstacles and adhering to constraints. Leveraging this benchmark, we systematically investigate LLMs including GPT-4 via different few-shot prompting methodologies as well as BART and T5 of various sizes via fine-tuning. Our experimental results show the promise of few-shot GPT-4 in spatial reasoning, when it is prompted to reason and act interleavedly, although it still fails to perform long-term temporal reasoning. In contrast, while fine-tuned LLMs achieved impressive results on in-distribution reasoning tasks, they struggled to generalize to larger environments or environments with more obstacles.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the creative problem-solving capabilities of modern LLMs in a novel constrained setting. To this end, we create MACGYVER, an automatically generated dataset consisting of over 1,600 real-world problems deliberately designed to trigger innovative usage of objects and necessitate out-of-the-box thinking. We then present our collection to both LLMs and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. MACGYVER is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, LLMs, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physically-infeasible actions. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis of LLMs, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking.
  This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problem-solving capabilities of both humans and AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshu Wang, Xiaoyang Chen, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Hao Wang, Zhenyu Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDBs) has been greatly advanced by the advent of large language models (LLMs), which provide an intuitive way to translate natural language (NL) questions into Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. While significant progress has been made in LLM-based NL2SQL, existing approaches face several challenges in real-world scenarios of natural language querying over massive databases. In this paper, we present DBCopilot, a framework that addresses these challenges by employing a compact and flexible copilot model for routing over massive databases. Specifically, DBCopilot decouples schema-agnostic NL2SQL into schema routing and SQL generation. This framework utilizes a single lightweight differentiable search index to construct semantic mappings for massive database schemata, and navigates natural language questions to their target databases and tables in a relation-aware joint retrieval manner. The routed schemata and questions are then fed into LLMs for effective SQL generation. Furthermore, DBCopilot introduces a reverse schema-to-question generation paradigm that can automatically learn and adapt the router over massive databases without manual intervention. Experimental results verify that DBCopilot is a scalable and effective solution for schema-agnostic NL2SQL, providing a significant advance in handling natural language querying over massive databases for NLIDBs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated coaching messages for weight control can save time and costs, but their repetitive, generic nature may limit their effectiveness compared to human coaching. Large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, like ChatGPT, could offer more personalized and novel messages to address repetition with their data-processing abilities. While LLM AI demonstrates promise to encourage healthier lifestyles, studies have yet to examine the feasibility and acceptability of LLM-based BWL coaching. 87 adults in a weight-loss trial rated ten coaching messages' helpfulness (five human-written, five ChatGPT-generated) using a 5-point Likert scale, providing additional open-ended feedback to justify their ratings. Participants also identified which messages they believed were AI-generated. The evaluation occurred in two phases: messages in Phase 1 were perceived as impersonal and negative, prompting revisions for Phase 2 messages. In Phase 1, AI-generated messages were rated less helpful than human-written ones, with 66 percent receiving a helpfulness rating of 3 or higher. However, in Phase 2, the AI messages matched the human-written ones regarding helpfulness, with 82% scoring three or above. Additionally, 50% were misidentified as human-written, suggesting AI's sophistication in mimicking human-generated content. A thematic analysis of open-ended feedback revealed that participants appreciated AI's empathy and personalized suggestions but found them more formulaic, less authentic, and too data-focused. This study reveals the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of LLM AIs, like ChatGPT, in crafting potentially effective weight control coaching messages. Our findings also underscore areas for future enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Bai, Heyan Huang, Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano, Marc-Antoine Rondeau, Sanxing Chen, Yang Gao, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective solution for few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs). However, how LLMs leverage demonstrations to specify a task and learn a corresponding computational function through ICL is underexplored. Drawing from the way humans learn from content-label mappings in demonstrations, we categorize the tokens in an ICL prompt into content, stopword, and template tokens. Our goal is to identify the types of tokens whose representations directly influence LLM's performance, a property we refer to as being performance-critical. By ablating representations from the attention of the test example, we find that the representations of informative content tokens have less influence on performance compared to template and stopword tokens, which contrasts with the human attention to informative words. We give evidence that the representations of performance-critical tokens aggregate information from the content tokens. Moreover, we demonstrate experimentally that lexical meaning, repetition, and structural cues are the main distinguishing characteristics of these tokens. Our work sheds light on how large language models learn to perform tasks from demonstrations and deepens our understanding of the roles different types of tokens play in large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the research landscape in artificial intelligence, particularly as model parameters scale up significantly, unlocking remarkable capabilities across various domains. Nevertheless, the scalability of model parameters faces constraints due to limitations in GPU memory and computational speed. To address these constraints, various weight compression methods have emerged, such as Pruning and Quantization. Given the low-rank nature of weight matrices in language models, the reduction of weights through matrix decomposition undoubtedly holds significant potential and promise. In this paper, drawing upon the intrinsic structure of LLMs, we propose a novel approach termed Data-free Joint Rank-k Approximation for compressing the parameter matrices. Significantly, our method is characterized by without necessitating additional involvement of any corpus, while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in conjunction with pruning and quantization methods. We achieve a model pruning of 80% parameters while retaining 93.43% of the original performance without any calibration data. Additionally, we explore the fundamental properties of the weight matrix of LLMs undergone Rank-k Approximation and conduct comprehensive experiments to elucidate our hypothesis.</p>

In contrast to traditionally used embeddings, encodings integrate contextual information. In our approach, we also employ a transformer-based decoder, specifically designed to incorporate context in the token prediction process. We conduct a comprehensive examination of the influence of the encoder, decoder, noise scheduler, and self-conditioning on zero-shot generation. Furthermore, we compare TEncDM with previous approaches on three conditional text generation tasks: QQP, XSum, and Wiki-Auto. The results show that TEncDM exhibits superior performance compared to existing non-autoregressive diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/M0RJIQUE/tencdm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Zhang, Marc Marone, Tianjian Li, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: To trust the fluent generations of large language models (LLMs), humans must be able to verify their correctness against trusted, external sources. Recent efforts, such as providing citations via retrieved documents or post-hoc provenance, enhance verifiability but provide no guarantees on their correctness. To address these limitations, we tackle the verifiability goal with a different philosophy: trivializing the verification process by developing models that quote verbatim statements from trusted sources in their pre-training data. We propose Quote-Tuning, which demonstrates the feasibility of aligning models to quote. The core of Quote-Tuning is a fast membership inference function that efficiently verifies text against trusted corpora. We leverage this tool to design a reward function to quantify quotes in model responses, and curate datasets for preference learning. Experiments show that Quote-Tuning significantly increases verbatim quotes from high-quality documents by up to 130% relative to base models while maintaining response quality. Quote-Tuning is applicable in different tasks, generalizes to out-of-domain data and diverse model families, and provides additional benefits to truthfulness. Our method not only serves as a hassle-free method to increase quoting but also opens up avenues for improving LLM trustworthiness through better verifiability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukyung Lee, Soonwon Ka, Bokyung Son, Pilsung Kang, Jaewook Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impacted the writing process, enhancing productivity by collaborating with humans in content creation platforms. However, generating high-quality, user-aligned text to satisfy real-world content creation needs remains challenging. We propose WritingPath, a framework that uses explicit outlines to guide LLMs in generating goal-oriented, high-quality text. Our approach draws inspiration from structured writing planning and reasoning paths, focusing on reflecting user intentions throughout the writing process. To validate our approach in real-world scenarios, we construct a diverse dataset from unstructured blog posts to benchmark writing performance and introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing the quality of outlines and generated texts. Our evaluations with various LLMs demonstrate that the WritingPath approach significantly enhances text quality according to evaluations by both LLMs and professional writers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Ji, Yang Xiang, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Zi Ye, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven advances in natural language processing. Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong structured pruning and low-rank compression techniques in maintaining model performance at the same compression ratio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Jin, Yutao Zhu, Guanting Dong, Yuyao Zhang, Xinyu Yang, Chenghao Zhang, Tong Zhao, Zhao Yang, Zhicheng Dou, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the potential of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has attracted considerable research attention. Various novel algorithms and models have been introduced to enhance different aspects of RAG systems. However, the absence of a standardized framework for implementation, coupled with the inherently complex RAG process, makes it challenging and time-consuming for researchers to compare and evaluate these approaches in a consistent environment. Existing RAG toolkits, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, while available, are often heavy and inflexibly, failing to meet the customization needs of researchers. In response to this challenge, we develop \ours{}, an efficient and modular open-source toolkit designed to assist researchers in reproducing and comparing existing RAG methods and developing their own algorithms within a unified framework. Our toolkit has implemented 16 advanced RAG methods and gathered and organized 38 benchmark datasets. It has various features, including a customizable modular framework, multimodal RAG capabilities, a rich collection of pre-implemented RAG works, comprehensive datasets, efficient auxiliary pre-processing scripts, and extensive and standard evaluation metrics. Our toolkit and resources are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandr Nikolich, Konstantin Korolev, Sergei Bratchikov, Igor Kiselev, Artem Shelmanov</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a surge in developing various Large Language Models (LLMs). However, text generation for languages other than English often faces significant challenges, including poor generation quality and reduced computational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens in the model's vocabulary. In this work, we address these issues by developing a pipeline for adapting English-oriented pre-trained models to other languages and constructing efficient bilingual LLMs. Using this pipeline, we construct Vikhr, a state-of-the-art bilingual open-source instruction-following LLM designed specifically for the Russian language. "Vikhr" refers to the name of the Mistral LLM series and means a "strong gust of wind." Unlike previous Russian-language models that typically rely on LoRA adapters on top of English-oriented models, sacrificing performance for lower training costs, Vikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes continued pre-training and instruction tuning of all weights. This not only enhances the model's performance but also significantly improves its computational and contextual efficiency. The remarkable performance of Vikhr across various Russian-language benchmarks can also be attributed to our efforts in expanding instruction datasets and corpora for continued pre-training. Vikhr not only sets a new state of the art among open-source LLMs for Russian but even outperforms some proprietary closed-source models on certain benchmarks. The model weights, instruction sets, and code are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent introduction of the Assistants API highlights its potential for large language models (LLMs) in role-playing agents (RPA). However, maintaining consistent character personas remains a significant challenge due to variability in information extraction, which frequently omits critical elements such as backstory or interpersonal relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce CharacterGPT, a framework designed to dynamically reconstruct character personas through Character Persona Training (CPT). This approach incrementally updates personas by extracting traits from chapter-wise novel summaries, reflecting the progression of the narrative. Our framework is evaluated through Big Five personality evaluations and creative tasks, in which characters generate original narratives, demonstrating the efficacy of CharacterGPT in preserving persona consistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Xu, Feng Jiang, Anningzhe Gao, Luis Fernando D'Haro, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In dialogue systems, discourse plays a crucial role in managing conversational focus and coordinating interactions. It consists of two key structures: rhetorical structure and topic structure. The former captures the logical flow of conversations, while the latter detects transitions between topics. Together, they improve the ability of a dialogue system to track conversation dynamics and generate contextually relevant high-quality responses. These structures are typically identified through discourse parsing and topic segmentation, respectively. However, existing supervised methods rely on costly manual annotations, while unsupervised methods often focus on a single task, overlooking the deep linguistic interplay between rhetorical and topic structures. To address these issues, we first introduce a unified representation that integrates rhetorical and topic structures, ensuring semantic consistency between them. Under the unified representation, we further propose two linguistically grounded hypotheses based on discourse theories: (1) Local Discourse Coupling, where rhetorical cues dynamically enhance topic-aware information flow, and (2) Global Topology Constraint, where topic structure patterns probabilistically constrain rhetorical relation distributions. Building on the unified representation and two hypotheses, we propose an unsupervised mutual learning framework (UMLF) that jointly models rhetorical and topic structures, allowing them to mutually reinforce each other without requiring additional annotations. We evaluate our approach on two rhetorical datasets and three topic segmentation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all strong baselines built on pre-trained language models. Furthermore, when applied to LLMs, our framework achieves notable improvements, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving discourse structure modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) technology has changed our role in interacting with these models. Instead of primarily testing these models with questions we already know answers to, we are now using them for queries where the answers are unknown to us, driven by human curiosity. This shift highlights the growing need to understand curiosity-driven human questions - those that are more complex, open-ended, and reflective of real-world needs. To this end, we present Quriosity, a collection of 13.5K naturally occurring questions from three diverse sources: human-to-search-engine queries, human-to-human interactions, and human-to-LLM conversations. Our comprehensive collection enables a rich understanding of human curiosity across various domains and contexts. Our analysis reveals a significant presence of causal questions (up to 42%) in the dataset, for which we develop an iterative prompt improvement framework to identify all causal queries and examine their unique linguistic properties, cognitive complexity and source distribution. Our paper paves the way for future work on causal question identification and open-ended chatbot interactions.</p>

We observe these groupings exhibit within-cluster organization (such as hierarchies, topological ordering, etc.), hypothesizing a fundamental structure that precedes contextual processing. To further investigate the conceptual nature of these groupings, we explore cross-model alignments across different LLM categories within their input embeddings, observing a medium to high degree of alignment. Furthermore, provide evidence that manipulating these groupings can play a functional role in mitigating ethnicity bias in LLM tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijin Hong, Zheng Yuan, Qinggang Zhang, Hao Chen, Junnan Dong, Feiran Huang, Xiao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating accurate SQL from users' natural language questions (text-to-SQL) remains a long-standing challenge due to the complexities involved in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restricts the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. Subsequently, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we make a summarization and discuss the remaining challenges in this field and suggest expectations for future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziche Liu, Rui Ke, Yajiao Liu, Feng Jiang, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) aims to choose a high-quality subset from existing datasets, allowing the trained model to outperform baselines trained on the full dataset. However, the expanding body of research lacks a clear, unified framework, and the variability in experimental settings complicates systematic comparisons. While existing surveys comprehensively overview the stages and methods of data selection, they often overlook an in-depth exploration of the fine-tuning phase. In this paper, we conduct a focused review of recent data selection techniques for fine-tuning LLMs, analyzing a dozen key studies. We introduce a novel three-stage scheme - comprising feature extraction, criteria design, and selector evaluation - to systematically categorize and evaluate these methods. Additionally, we propose a unified comparison approach that incorporates ratio-based efficiency and ranking-based feasibility metrics to address inconsistencies across experiments. Our findings reveal that methods emphasizing more targeted quality measurement achieve higher efficiency but at the cost of feasibility. Finally, we discuss trends and highlight four key challenges in fine-tuning data selection, offering potential directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Shi, Mengqi Yuan, Junkang Wu, Qifan Wang, Fuli Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent tasks is critical in developing language agents. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising technique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors, offering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives. However, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the inability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves making the partition function independent of the current state and addressing length disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this light, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure constraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the Bradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn agent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three multi-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the DMPO loss. The code is available at https://github.com/swt-user/DMPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Zhao, Chenghao Xiao, Chen Tang, Bohao Yang, Kai Ye, Noura Al Moubayed, Liang Zhan, Chenghua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) has achieved significant progress with the advancements of multimodal generative models. However, the evaluation in the domain suffers from a lack of fair and robust metrics. We reveal that, high performance on RRG with existing lexical-based metrics (e.g. BLEU) might be more of a mirage - a model can get a high BLEU only by learning the template of reports. This has become an urgent problem for RRG due to the highly patternized nature of these reports. In this work, we un-intuitively approach this problem by proposing the Layman's RRG framework, a layman's terms-based dataset, evaluation and training framework that systematically improves RRG with day-to-day language. We first contribute the translated Layman's terms dataset. Building upon the dataset, we then propose a semantics-based evaluation method, which is proved to mitigate the inflated numbers of BLEU and provides fairer evaluation. Last, we show that training on the layman's terms dataset encourages models to focus on the semantics of the reports, as opposed to overfitting to learning the report templates. We reveal a promising scaling law between the number of training examples and semantics gain provided by our dataset, compared to the inverse pattern brought by the original formats.

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, concerns regarding the potential negative societal impacts of LLM-generated content have also arisen. To evaluate the biases exhibited by LLMs, researchers have recently proposed a variety of datasets. However, existing bias evaluation efforts often focus on only a particular type of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, leading to difficulties in comparison across different datasets and LLMs. To address these limitations, we collect a variety of datasets designed for the bias evaluation of LLMs, and further propose CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Benchmark that covers different types of bias across different social groups and tasks. The curation of CEB is based on our newly proposed compositional taxonomy, which characterizes each dataset from three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks. By combining the three dimensions, we develop a comprehensive evaluation strategy for the bias in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that the levels of bias vary across these dimensions, thereby providing guidance for the development of specific bias mitigation methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dialogue agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show superior performance in various tasks. Despite the better user understanding and human-like responses, their lack of controllability remains a key challenge, often leading to unfocused conversations or task failure. To address this, we introduce Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to regulate dialogue flow. Specifically, we propose ChatSOP, a novel SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning framework designed to enhance the controllability of LLM-driven dialogue agents. To enable this, we curate a dataset comprising SOP-annotated multi-scenario dialogues, generated using a semi-automated role-playing system with GPT-4o and validated through strict manual quality control. Additionally, we propose a novel method that integrates Chain of Thought reasoning with supervised fine-tuning for SOP prediction and utilizes SOP-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimal action planning during dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, such as achieving a 27.95% improvement in action accuracy compared to baseline models based on GPT-3.5 and also showing notable gains for open-source models.

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debates have been introduced to improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by having multiple agents discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, models often generate incorrect yet confident-sounding responses, which can mislead others. This issue arises partly because agents do not consider how confident their peers are. To address this, we propose DebUnc, a debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence. Confidence is then conveyed through a modified attention mechanism that adjusts token weights, or through textual prompts. Evaluations across benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective and that performance continues to improve as uncertainty estimation becomes more reliable.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in a wide array of natural language processing tasks. However, its effectiveness over discourse-level event relation extraction (ERE) tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.

<p>Abstract: We present the first systematic evaluation examining format bias in performance of large language models (LLMs). Our approach distinguishes between two categories of an evaluation metric under format constraints to reliably and accurately assess performance: one measures performance when format constraints are adhered to, while the other evaluates performance regardless of constraint adherence. We then define a metric for measuring the format bias of LLMs and establish effective strategies to reduce it. Subsequently, we present our empirical format bias evaluation spanning four commonly used categories -- multiple-choice question-answer, wrapping, list, and mapping -- covering 15 widely-used formats. Our evaluation on eight generation tasks uncovers significant format bias across state-of-the-art LLMs. We further discover that improving the format-instruction following capabilities of LLMs across formats potentially reduces format bias. Based on our evaluation findings, we study prompting and fine-tuning with synthesized format data techniques to mitigate format bias. Our methods successfully reduce the variance in ChatGPT's performance among wrapping formats from 235.33 to 0.71 (%$^2$).</p>

<p>Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) converts sign videos directly into spoken language sentences without relying on glosses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in natural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify societal biases, particularly those related to gender. In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs. However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs. Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jizhan Fang, Tianhe Lu, Yunzhi Yao, Ziyan Jiang, Xin Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fajri Koto</p>
<p>Abstract: While knowledge evaluation in large language models has predominantly focused on academic subjects like math and physics, these assessments often fail to capture the practical demands of real-world professions. In this paper, we introduce IndoCareer, a dataset comprising 8,834 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate performance in vocational and professional certification exams across various fields. With a focus on Indonesia, IndoCareer provides rich local contexts, spanning six key sectors: (1) healthcare, (2) insurance and finance, (3) creative and design, (4) tourism and hospitality, (5) education and training, and (6) law. Our comprehensive evaluation of 27 large language models shows that these models struggle particularly in fields with strong local contexts, such as insurance and finance. Additionally, while using the entire dataset, shuffling answer options generally maintains consistent evaluation results across models, but it introduces instability specifically in the insurance and finance sectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjun Luo, Yingbin Jin, Xinfeng Li, Xuecheng Liu, Ruizhe Chen, Tong Shang, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more researchers apply LLMs for Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods, bringing vitality to this classical Natural Language Processing task. However, existing datasets are designed for traditional machine learning methods, inadequate for LLM-based methods in terms of corpus selection, entity categorization, and design logic. This limitation leads to less effective evaluation and model fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose DynamicNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs and with dynamic categorization, transcending the limitations of fixed categorization in existing datasets. It is also multi-lingual and multi-granular, covering 8 languages and 155 entity types, with corpus spanning multiple specialized domains. Furthermore, in response to the limitations demonstrated by existing LLM-based methods during DynamicNER testing, we develop CascadeNER, a novel NER method based on a two-stage strategy and lightweight LLMs, addressing the problems in current methods. Experiments show that DynamicNER is an effective benchmark for LLM-based NER methods, and CascadeNER outperforms existing methods with fewer computational resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tzu-Lin Kuo, Feng-Ting Liao, Mu-Wei Hsieh, Fu-Chieh Chang, Po-Chun Hsu, Da-Shan Shiu</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), external retrieval mechanisms - such as Search-Augmented Generation (SAG), tool utilization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - are often employed to enhance the quality of augmented generations in dialogues. These approaches often come with multi-turn dialogue, where each interaction is enriched by relevant information retrieved from external sources. Existing benchmarks either assess LLMs' chat abilities in multi-turn dialogues or their use of retrieval for augmented responses in single-turn settings. However, there is a gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to leverage retrieval for more precise responses across multiple turns. To address this limitation, we introduce RAD-Bench (Retrieval Augmented Dialogue), a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn dialogues following retrievals, essential for their deployment in context-rich applications. RAD-Bench evaluates two key abilities of LLMs: Retrieval Synthesis and Retrieval Reasoning. These are measured using discriminative questions and retrieved contexts, and corresponding reference answers, assessing how effectively LLMs integrate and reason with context to maintain and enhance conversation quality over multiple turns. Our evaluation results on commonly used LLMs reveal that model performance deteriorates as additional layers of conditions or constraints are applied across conversation turns, even when accurate retrieved contexts are provided.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Zhang, Dading Chong, Feng Jiang, Chengguang Tang, Anningzhe Gao, Guohua Tang, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In natural human-to-human conversations, participants often receive feedback signals from one another based on their follow-up reactions. These reactions can include verbal responses, facial expressions, changes in emotional state, and other non-verbal cues. Similarly, in human-machine interactions, the machine can leverage the user's follow-up utterances as feedback signals to assess whether it has appropriately addressed the user's request. Therefore, we propose using the likelihood of follow-up utterances as rewards to differentiate preferred responses from less favored ones, without relying on human or commercial LLM-based preference annotations. Our proposed reward mechanism, ``Follow-up Likelihood as Reward" (FLR), matches the performance of strong reward models trained on large-scale human or GPT-4 annotated data on 8 pairwise-preference and 4 rating-based benchmarks. Building upon the FLR mechanism, we propose to automatically mine preference data from the online generations of a base policy model. The preference data are subsequently used to boost the helpfulness of the base model through direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods, such as direct preference optimization (DPO). Lastly, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the language model that provides follow-up likelihood with natural language feedback significantly enhances FLR's performance on reward modeling benchmarks and effectiveness in aligning the base policy model's helpfulness.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs approach logical and mathematical reasoning through natural or symbolic languages. While natural language offers human-accessible flexibility but suffers from ambiguity, symbolic reasoning provides precise, machine-executable inferences at the cost of strict domain constraints. We introduce HYBRIDMIND, an adaptive strategy that selects the optimal reasoning approach for each reasoning problem. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate both prompting-based approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned open-source models. We find that fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct as a meta-selector outperforms GPT-4o's natural language reasoning by 4.4\% on FOLIO and 1.3\% on MATH. More notably, using GPT-3.5-turbo as a prompted meta-selector yields a 10\% improvement on FOLIO's challenging subset compared to GPT-4o. We will release our code and data to support future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Sky Li, Weize Chen, Qizhi Chu, Haopeng Li, Zhaojun Sun, Ran Li, Chen Qian, Yiwei Wei, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun, Cheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The need to analyze graphs is ubiquitous across various fields, from social networks to biological research and recommendation systems. Therefore, enabling the ability of large language models (LLMs) to process graphs is an important step toward more advanced general intelligence. However, current LLM benchmarks on graph analysis require models to directly reason over the prompts describing graph topology, and are thus limited to small graphs with only a few dozens of nodes. In contrast, human experts typically write programs based on popular libraries for task solving, and can thus handle graphs with different scales. To this end, a question naturally arises: can LLMs analyze graphs like professionals? In this paper, we introduce ProGraph, a manually crafted benchmark containing 3 categories of graph tasks. The benchmark expects solutions based on programming instead of directly reasoning over raw inputs. Our findings reveal that the performance of current LLMs is unsatisfactory, with the best model achieving only 36% accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose LLM4Graph datasets, which include crawled documents and auto-generated codes based on 6 widely used graph libraries. By augmenting closed-source LLMs with document retrieval and fine-tuning open-source ones on the codes, we show 11-32% absolute improvements in their accuracies. Our results underscore that the capabilities of LLMs in handling structured data are still under-explored, and show the effectiveness of LLM4Graph in enhancing LLMs' proficiency of graph analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seanie Lee, Haebin Seong, Dong Bok Lee, Minki Kang, Xiaoyin Chen, Dominik Wagner, Yoshua Bengio, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety guard models that detect malicious queries aimed at large language models (LLMs) are essential for ensuring the secure and responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. However, deploying existing safety guard models with billions of parameters alongside LLMs on mobile devices is impractical due to substantial memory requirements and latency. To reduce this cost, we distill a large teacher safety guard model into a smaller one using a labeled dataset of instruction-response pairs with binary harmfulness labels. Due to the limited diversity of harmful instructions in the existing labeled dataset, naively distilled models tend to underperform compared to larger models. To bridge the gap between small and large models, we propose HarmAug, a simple yet effective data augmentation method that involves jailbreaking an LLM and prompting it to generate harmful instructions. Given a prompt such as, "Make a single harmful instruction prompt that would elicit offensive content", we add an affirmative prefix (e.g., "I have an idea for a prompt:") to the LLM's response. This encourages the LLM to continue generating the rest of the response, leading to sampling harmful instructions. Another LLM generates a response to the harmful instruction, and the teacher model labels the instruction-response pair. We empirically show that our HarmAug outperforms other relevant baselines. Moreover, a 435-million-parameter safety guard model trained with HarmAug achieves an F1 score comparable to larger models with over 7 billion parameters, and even outperforms them in AUPRC, while operating at less than 25% of their computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Zeqi Tan, Sihao Shen, Weiming Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social intelligence is built upon three foundational pillars: cognitive intelligence, situational intelligence, and behavioral intelligence. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our social lives, understanding, evaluating, and developing their social intelligence are becoming increasingly important. While multiple existing works have investigated the social intelligence of LLMs, (1) most focus on a specific aspect, and the social intelligence of LLMs has yet to be systematically organized and studied; (2) position LLMs as passive observers from a third-person perspective, such as in Theory of Mind (ToM) tests. Compared to the third-person perspective, ego-centric first-person perspective evaluation can align well with actual LLM-based Agent use scenarios. (3) a lack of comprehensive evaluation of behavioral intelligence, with specific emphasis on incorporating critical human-machine interaction scenarios. In light of this, we present EgoSocialArena, a novel framework grounded in the three pillars of social intelligence: cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence, aimed to systematically evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs from a first-person perspective. With EgoSocialArena, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight prominent foundation models, even the most advanced LLMs like O1-preview lag behind human performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxin Chen, Zhong Zhang, Xin Cong, Fangda Guo, Yesai Wu, Yankai Lin, Wenzheng Feng, Yasheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool learning enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly expanding the application scope of LLMs. However, due to the dynamic nature of external environments, these tools and APIs may become outdated over time, preventing LLMs from correctly invoking tools. Existing research primarily focuses on static environments and overlooks this issue, limiting the adaptability of LLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ToolEVO, a novel framework designed to enhance the adaptive and reflective capabilities of LLMs against tool variability. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, ToolEVO facilitates active exploration and interaction of LLMs within dynamic environments, allowing for autonomous self-reflection and self-updating of tool usage based on environmental feedback. Additionally, we introduce ToolQA-D, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of tool variability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach, highlighting the importance of adaptability to tool variability for effective tool learning.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorfBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorfEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximus Powers, Umang Mavani, Harshitha Reddy Jonala, Ansh Tiwari, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of social bias in text is a critical challenge, particularly due to the limitations of binary classification methods. These methods often oversimplify nuanced biases, leading to high emotional impact when content is misclassified as either "biased" or "fair." To address these shortcomings, we propose a more nuanced framework that focuses on three key linguistic components underlying social bias: Generalizations, Unfairness, and Stereotypes (the GUS framework). The GUS framework employs a semi-automated approach to create a comprehensive synthetic dataset, which is then verified by humans to maintain ethical standards. This dataset enables robust multi-label token classification. Our methodology, which combines discriminative (encoder-only) models and generative (auto-regressive large language models), identifies biased entities in text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that encoder-only models are effective for this complex task, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of macro and entity-wise F1-score and Hamming loss. These findings can guide the choice of model for different use cases, highlighting the GUS framework's effectiveness in capturing explicit and implicit biases across diverse contexts, and offering a pathway for future research and applications in various fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: Collaborative learning of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a new paradigm for utilizing private data from different parties to guarantee efficiency and privacy. Meanwhile, Knowledge Editing (KE) for LLMs has also garnered increased attention due to its ability to manipulate the behaviors of LLMs explicitly, yet leaves the collaborative KE case (in which knowledge edits of multiple parties are aggregated in a privacy-preserving and continual manner) unexamined. To this end, this manuscript dives into the first investigation of collaborative KE, in which we start by carefully identifying the unique three challenges therein, including knowledge overlap, knowledge conflict, and knowledge forgetting. We then propose a non-destructive collaborative KE framework, COLLABEDIT, which employs a novel model merging mechanism to mimic the global KE behavior while preventing the severe performance drop. Extensive experiments on two canonical datasets demonstrate the superiority of COLLABEDIT compared to other destructive baselines, and results shed light on addressing three collaborative KE challenges and future applications.

<p>Abstract: Humans are accustomed to reading and writing in a forward manner, and this natural bias extends to text understanding in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). This paper investigates whether LLMs, like humans, struggle with reverse modeling, specifically with reversed text inputs. We found that publicly available pre-trained LLMs cannot understand such inputs. However, LLMs trained from scratch with both forward and reverse texts can understand them equally well during inference across multiple languages. Our case study shows that different-content texts result in different losses if input (to LLMs) in different directions -- some get lower losses for forward while some for reverse. This leads us to a simple and nice solution for data selection based on the loss differences between forward and reverse directions. Using our selected data in continued pretraining can boost LLMs' performance by a large margin across different language understanding benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Wang, Xiang Chen, Ningyu Zhang, Bozhong Tian, Haoming Xu, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs DeCo, which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhong Zhou, Haiyang Yu, Xinghua Zhang, Rongwu Xu, Fei Huang, Kun Wang, Yang Liu, Junfeng Fang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple language tasks, yet their safety guardrails can be circumvented, leading to harmful generations. In light of this, recent research on safety mechanisms has emerged, revealing that when safety representations or component are suppressed, the safety capability of LLMs are compromised. However, existing research tends to overlook the safety impact of multi-head attention mechanisms, despite their crucial role in various model functionalities. Hence, in this paper, we aim to explore the connection between standard attention mechanisms and safety capability to fill this gap in the safety-related mechanistic interpretability. We propose a novel metric which tailored for multi-head attention, the Safety Head ImPortant Score (Ships), to assess the individual heads' contributions to model safety. Based on this, we generalize Ships to the dataset level and further introduce the Safety Attention Head AttRibution Algorithm (Sahara) to attribute the critical safety attention heads inside the model. Our findings show that the special attention head has a significant impact on safety. Ablating a single safety head allows aligned model (e.g., Llama-2-7b-chat) to respond to 16 times more harmful queries, while only modifying 0.006% of the parameters, in contrast to the ~ 5% modification required in previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate that attention heads primarily function as feature extractors for safety and models fine-tuned from the same base model exhibit overlapping safety heads through comprehensive experiments. Together, our attribution approach and findings provide a novel perspective for unpacking the black box of safety mechanisms within large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Bai, Yi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurons in auto-regressive language models like GPT-2 can be interpreted by analyzing their activation patterns. Recent studies have shown that techniques such as dictionary learning, a form of post-hoc sparse coding, enhance this neuron-level interpretability. In our research, we are driven by the goal to fundamentally improve neural network interpretability by embedding sparse coding directly within the model architecture, rather than applying it as an afterthought. In our study, we introduce a white-box transformer-like architecture named Coding RAte TransformEr (CRATE), explicitly engineered to capture sparse, low-dimensional structures within data distributions. Our comprehensive experiments showcase significant improvements (up to 103% relative improvement) in neuron-level interpretability across a variety of evaluation metrics. Detailed investigations confirm that this enhanced interpretability is steady across different layers irrespective of the model size, underlining CRATE's robust performance in enhancing neural network interpretability. Further analysis shows that CRATE's increased interpretability comes from its enhanced ability to consistently and distinctively activate on relevant tokens. These findings point towards a promising direction for creating white-box foundation models that excel in neuron-level interpretation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising new paradigm for text generative modeling, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models. However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, we show that we can convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Our experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. We release a suite of DLMs (127M-355M-7B) capable of generating fluent text, performing in-context learning, filling in the middle without prompt re-ordering, and following instructions https://github.com/HKUNLP/DiffuLLaMA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zimo Qi, Guangliang Liu, Kristen Marie Johnson, Lu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Though there has been intensive attention to the self-correction capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), there are variant conclusions about its effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to identify the bottlenecks that hinder self-correction in LLMs by answering two fundamental questions for moral self-correction: (1) how different components in self-correction, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, external feedback, and instructional prompts, interact to enable moral self-correction; and (2) is the self-correction one of LLMs' innate capabilities? To answer the first question, we examine how different self-correction components interact to intervene in the embedded morality within hidden states. For the second question, we propose a framework, self-distinguish, that requires effective self-correction to distinguish between desirable and undesirable outputs. Our mechanistic analysis reveals two primary bottlenecks for moral self-correction: (1) LLMs can not effectively leverage helpful feedback; (2) there exists conflicts between feedback and CoT. The self-distinguish experiment suggests that LLMs struggle to tell the differences among their outputs, which reveals an explanation to the two bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we re-formulate the model compression problem into the customized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, we aim to introduce residual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customized requirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greater flexibility in balancing accuracy and overhead(inference and model size) without being bound to fixed compression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs more flexibly. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/EoRA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. In this study, we introduce AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. We will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Blouir, Jimmy T. H. Smith, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Amarda Shehu</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient state space models (SSMs), such as linear recurrent neural networks and linear attention variants, offer computational advantages over Transformers but struggle with tasks requiring long-range in-context retrieval-like text copying, associative recall, and question answering over long contexts. Previous efforts to address these challenges have focused on architectural modifications, often reintroducing computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the in-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture. Our approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of specialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We introduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from bidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling. This narrows the performance gap with Transformers, while retaining computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of training procedures in leveraging the fixed-state capacity of SSMs, offering a new direction to advance their capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code debugging by directly generating the correct code based on the buggy code snippet. Programming benchmarks, typically consisting of buggy code snippet and their associated test cases, are used to assess the debugging capabilities of LLMs. However, many existing benchmarks primarily focus on Python and are often limited in terms of language diversity (e.g., DebugBench and DebugEval). To advance the field of multilingual debugging with LLMs, we propose the first massively multilingual debugging benchmark, which includes 3.6K test samples of 18 programming languages and covers the automated program repair (APR) task, the code review (CR) task, and the bug identification (BI) task. Further, we introduce the debugging instruction corpora MDEVAL-INSTRUCT by injecting bugs into the correct multilingual queries and solutions (xDebugGen). Further, a multilingual debugger xDebugCoder trained on MDEVAL-INSTRUCT as a strong baseline specifically to handle the bugs of a wide range of programming languages (e.g. "Missing Mut" in language Rust and "Misused Macro Definition" in language C). Our extensive experiments on MDEVAL reveal a notable performance gap between open-source models and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT and Claude series), highlighting huge room for improvement in multilingual code debugging scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02571">MM-Embed: Universal Multimodal Retrieval with Multimodal LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jimmy Lin, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhuo, Ya Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaoqing Li, Xun Zhou, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

<p>Abstract: Existing text simplification or paraphrase datasets mainly focus on sentence-level text generation in a general domain. These datasets are typically developed without using domain knowledge. In this paper, we release a novel dataset, VTechAGP, which is the first academic-to-general-audience text paraphrase dataset consisting of document-level these and dissertation academic and general-audience abstract pairs from 8 colleges authored over 25 years. We also propose a novel dynamic soft prompt generative language model, DSPT5. For training, we leverage a contrastive-generative loss function to learn the keyword vectors in the dynamic prompt. For inference, we adopt a crowd-sampling decoding strategy at both semantic and structural levels to further select the best output candidate. We evaluate DSPT5 and various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from multiple perspectives. Results demonstrate that the SOTA LLMs do not provide satisfactory outcomes, while the lightweight DSPT5 can achieve competitive results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a benchmark dataset and solutions for academic-to-general-audience text paraphrase dataset. Models will be public after acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Wang, Xiaomeng Zhu, Weimin Lyu, Saeed Hassanpour, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling implicit language is essential for natural language processing systems to achieve precise text understanding and facilitate natural interactions with users. Despite its importance, the absence of a metric for accurately measuring the implicitness of language significantly constrains the depth of analysis possible in evaluating models' comprehension capabilities. This paper addresses this gap by developing a scalar metric that quantifies the implicitness level of language without relying on external references. Drawing on principles from traditional linguistics, we define "implicitness" as the divergence between semantic meaning and pragmatic interpretation. To operationalize this definition, we introduce ImpScore, a reference-free metric formulated through an interpretable regression model. This model is trained using pairwise contrastive learning on a specially curated dataset consisting of (implicit sentence, explicit sentence) pairs. We validate ImpScore through a user study that compares its assessments with human evaluations on out-of-distribution data, demonstrating its accuracy and strong correlation with human judgments. Additionally, we apply ImpScore to hate speech detection datasets, illustrating its utility and highlighting significant limitations in current large language models' ability to understand highly implicit content. Our metric is publicly available at https://github.com/audreycs/ImpScore.</p>

In doing so, we propose entropy-adaptive Gibbs sampling and entropy-based noise scheduling to counterbalance each model's shortcomings. Experimental results show that Diffusion-EAGS outperforms baselines and achieves the best quality-diversity tradeoff, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-autoregressive text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Liu, Jirui Qi, Paul He, Arianna Bisazza, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation are easily influenced by the order, in which the retrieved documents are presented to the model when solving tasks such as question answering (QA). However, there is no method to date that exploits this phenomenon to improve generation. We fill this gap. In this study, we show that the pointwise mutual information between a context and a question is an effective gauge for language model performance. Importantly, this gauge does not depend on knowing the answer to the question a priori. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets and a variety of large language models, we find evidence for an empirical correlation between answer accuracy and pointwise mutual information. Additionally, we propose two methods that use the pointwise mutual information between a document and a question as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance, whose effectiveness we demonstrate through experimentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model unlearning aims to remove harmful information that LLMs have learnt to prevent their use for malicious purposes. LLMU and RMU have been proposed as two methods for LLM unlearning, achieving impressive results on unlearning benchmarks. We study in detail the impact of unlearning on LLM performance metrics using the WMDP dataset as well as a new biology dataset we create. We show that unlearning has a notable impact on general model capabilities, with the performance degradation being more significant in general for LLMU. We further test the robustness of the two methods and find that doing 5-shot prompting or rephrasing the question in simple ways can lead to an over ten-fold increase in accuracy on unlearning benchmarks. Finally, we show that training on unrelated data can almost completely recover pre-unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods fail at truly unlearning. Our methodology serves as an evaluation framework for LLM unlearning methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/JaiDoshi/Knowledge-Erasure.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective toxic content detection relies heavily on high-quality and diverse data, which serve as the foundation for robust content moderation models. Synthetic data has become a common approach for training models across various NLP tasks. However, its effectiveness remains uncertain for highly subjective tasks like hate speech detection, with previous research yielding mixed results. This study explores the potential of open-source LLMs for harmful data synthesis, utilizing controlled prompting and supervised fine-tuning techniques to enhance data quality and diversity. We systematically evaluated 6 open source LLMs on 5 datasets, assessing their ability to generate diverse, high-quality harmful data while minimizing hallucination and duplication. Our results show that Mistral consistently outperforms other open models, and supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances data reliability and diversity. We further analyze the trade-offs between prompt-based vs. fine-tuned toxic data synthesis, discuss real-world deployment challenges, and highlight ethical considerations. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned open source LLMs provide scalable and cost-effective solutions to augment toxic content detection datasets, paving the way for more accessible and transparent content moderation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Amiri-Margavi, Iman Jebellat, Ehsan Jebellat, Seyed Pouyan Mousavi Davoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a collaborative framework in which multiple large language models -- including GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash -- generate and answer complex, PhD-level statistical questions when definitive ground truth is unavailable. Our study examines how inter-model consensus improves both response reliability and identifies the quality of the generated questions. Employing chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa, and confidence interval analysis, we quantify consensus rates and inter-rater agreement to assess both response precision and question quality. Key results indicate that Claude and GPT-4 produce well-structured, less ambiguous questions with a higher inter-rater agreement, as shown by narrower confidence intervals and greater alignment with question-generating models. In contrast, Gemini and LLaMA exhibit greater variability and lower reliability in question formulation. These findings demonstrate that collaborative interactions among large language models enhance response reliability and provide valuable insights for optimizing AI-driven collaborative reasoning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Bajpai, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON, a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages -- Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Rezaeimanesh, Faezeh Hosseini, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown superior capabilities in translating figurative language compared to neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, the impact of different prompting methods and LLM-NMT combinations on idiom translation has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This paper introduces two parallel datasets of sentences containing idiomatic expressions for Persian$\rightarrow$English and English$\rightarrow$Persian translations, with Persian idioms sampled from our PersianIdioms resource, a collection of 2,200 idioms and their meanings, with 700 including usage examples. Using these datasets, we evaluate various open- and closed-source LLMs, NMT models, and their combinations. Translation quality is assessed through idiom translation accuracy and fluency. We also find that automatic evaluation methods like LLM-as-a-judge, BLEU, and BERTScore are effective for comparing different aspects of model performance. Our experiments reveal that Claude-3.5-Sonnet delivers outstanding results in both translation directions. For English$\rightarrow$Persian, combining weaker LLMs with Google Translate improves results, while Persian$\rightarrow$English translations benefit from single prompts for simpler models and complex prompts for advanced ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhe Wang, Shengyu Zhang, Jie Zhang, Runyi Hu, Xiaoya Li, Tianwei Zhang, Jiwei Li, Fei Wu, Guoyin Wang, Eduard Hovy</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced large language models (LLMs), particularly exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have exhibited outstanding performance. Despite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its implementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward modeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses challenges for researchers and practitioners in developing a systematic understanding of RL-enhanced LLMs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive survey summarizing existing research on RL-enhanced LLMs has limited progress in this domain, hindering further advancements.
  In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Junqi Tong, Min Liu, Qi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaphor serves as an implicit approach to convey information, while enabling the generalized comprehension of complex subjects. However, metaphor can potentially be exploited to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the theft of harmful knowledge. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits the imaginative capacity of LLMs to achieve jailbreaking, the J\underline{\textbf{A}}ilbreak \underline{\textbf{V}}ia \underline{\textbf{A}}dversarial Me\underline{\textbf{TA}} -pho\underline{\textbf{R}} (\textit{AVATAR}). Specifically, to elicit the harmful response, AVATAR extracts harmful entities from a given harmful target and maps them to innocuous adversarial entities based on LLM's imagination. Then, according to these metaphors, the harmful target is nested within human-like interaction for jailbreaking adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferablly jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs. Our study exposes a security risk in LLMs from their endogenous imaginative capabilities. Furthermore, the analytical study reveals the vulnerability of LLM to adversarial metaphors and the necessity of developing defense methods against jailbreaking caused by the adversarial metaphor. \textcolor{orange}{ \textbf{Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful content from LLMs.}}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kepu Zhang, Weijie Yu, Sunhao Dai, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose CitaLaw, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to produce legally sound responses with appropriate citations. CitaLaw features a diverse set of legal questions for both laypersons and practitioners, paired with a comprehensive corpus of law articles and precedent cases as a reference pool. This framework enables LLM-based systems to retrieve supporting citations from the reference corpus and align these citations with the corresponding sentences in their responses. Moreover, we introduce syllogism-inspired evaluation methods to assess the legal alignment between retrieved references and LLM-generated responses, as well as their consistency with user questions. Extensive experiments on 2 open-domain and 7 legal-specific LLMs demonstrate that integrating legal references substantially enhances response quality. Furthermore, our proposed syllogism-based evaluation method exhibits strong agreement with human judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kepu Zhang, Haoyue Yang, Xu Tang, Weijie Yu, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In legal practice, judges apply the trichotomous dogmatics of criminal law, sequentially assessing the elements of the offense, unlawfulness, and culpability to determine whether an individual's conduct constitutes a crime. Although current legal large language models (LLMs) show promising accuracy in judgment prediction, they lack trichotomous reasoning capabilities due to the absence of an appropriate benchmark dataset, preventing them from predicting innocent outcomes. As a result, every input is automatically assigned a charge, limiting their practical utility in legal contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce LJPIV, the first benchmark dataset for Legal Judgment Prediction with Innocent Verdicts. Adhering to the trichotomous dogmatics, we extend three widely-used legal datasets through LLM-based augmentation and manual verification. Our experiments with state-of-the-art legal LLMs and novel strategies that integrate trichotomous reasoning into zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning reveal: (1) current legal LLMs have significant room for improvement, with even the best models achieving an F1 score of less than 0.3 on LJPIV; and (2) our strategies notably enhance both in-domain and cross-domain judgment prediction accuracy, especially for cases resulting in an innocent verdict.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshvivek Kashid, Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has revolutionized the digitization of printed text, enabling efficient data extraction and analysis across various domains. Just like Machine Translation systems, OCR systems are prone to errors. In this work, we address the challenge of data generation and post-OCR error correction, specifically for low-resource languages. We propose an approach for synthetic data generation for Devanagari languages, RoundTripOCR, that tackles the scarcity of the post-OCR Error Correction datasets for low-resource languages. We release post-OCR text correction datasets for Hindi, Marathi, Bodo, Nepali, Konkani and Sanskrit. We also present a novel approach for OCR error correction by leveraging techniques from machine translation. Our method involves translating erroneous OCR output into a corrected form by treating the OCR errors as mistranslations in a parallel text corpus, employing pre-trained transformer models to learn the mapping from erroneous to correct text pairs, effectively correcting OCR errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanshuang Kong, Richong Zhang, Ziqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) aims to assign one or more labels in the hierarchy for each text. Many methods represent this structure as a global hierarchy, leading to redundant graph structures. To address this, incorporating a text-specific local hierarchy is essential. However, existing approaches often model this local hierarchy as a sequence, focusing on explicit parent-child relationships while ignoring implicit correlations among sibling/peer relationships. In this paper, we first integrate local hierarchies into a manual depth-level prompt to capture parent-child relationships. We then apply Mixup to this hierarchical prompt tuning scheme to improve the latent correlation within sibling/peer relationships. Notably, we propose a novel Mixup ratio guided by local hierarchy correlation to effectively capture intrinsic correlations. This Local Hierarchy Mixup (LH-Mix) model demonstrates remarkable performance across three widely-used datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipeng Kang, Junqi Wang, Yexin Li, Mengmeng Wang, Wenming Tu, Quansen Wang, Hengli Li, Tingjun Wu, Xue Feng, Fangwei Zhong, Zilong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Gao, Alexander Wettig, Luxi He, Yihe Dong, Sadhika Malladi, Danqi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The vast diversity of styles, domains, and quality levels present in language model pre-training corpora is essential in developing general model capabilities, but efficiently learning and deploying the correct behaviors exemplified in each of these heterogeneous data sources is challenging. To address this, we propose a new method, termed Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown (MeCo), to incorporate additional learning cues during pre-training. MeCo first provides metadata (e.g., URLs like www$.$wikipedia$.$org) alongside the text during training and later uses a cooldown phase with only the standard text, thereby enabling the model to function normally even without metadata. MeCo significantly accelerates pre-training across different model scales (600M to 8B parameters) and training sources (C4, RefinedWeb, and DCLM). For instance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task performance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data. Additionally, MeCo enables us to steer language models by conditioning the inference prompt on either real or fabricated metadata that encodes the desired properties of the output: for example, prepending wikipedia$.$org to reduce harmful generations or factquizmaster$.$com (fabricated) to improve common knowledge task performance. We also demonstrate that MeCo is compatible with different types of metadata, such as model-generated topics. MeCo is remarkably simple, adds no computational overhead, and demonstrates promise in producing more capable and steerable language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Li, Yupeng Su, Runming Yang, Congkai Xie, Zheng Wang, Zhongwei Xie, Ngai Wong, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved significant advancements in complex mathematical reasoning benchmarks, such as MATH. However, their substantial computational requirements present challenges for practical deployment. Model quantization has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce memory usage and computational costs by employing lower precision and bit-width representations. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of quantization on mathematical reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that aggressive quantization methods like AWQ and GPTQ introduce up to 32.39% accuracy degradation (average 11.31%) on Llama-3 models, particularly in numerical computation and reasoning planning. To address this, we introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework combining qualitative capability analysis and quantitative error assessment. We further develop targeted recovery strategies, showing that fine-tuning quantized models on only 545 task-specific examples for 3 minutes on 4 GPUs effectively restores reasoning capabilities to near full-precision levels. Additionally, our error assessment pipeline achieves 98.9% accuracy in diagnosing and localizing errors across 3,366 failure cases, providing actionable insights for mitigating quantization-induced degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in omnimodal learning have significantly improved understanding and generation across images, text, and speech, yet these developments remain predominantly confined to proprietary models. The lack of high-quality omnimodal datasets and the challenges of real-time emotional speech synthesis have notably hindered progress in open-source research. To address these limitations, we introduce \name, a two-stage training framework that integrates omnimodal alignment and speech generation to develop a state-of-the-art omnimodal large language model. In the alignment phase, a pre-trained speech model undergoes further training on text-image tasks, enabling (near) zero-shot generalization from vision to speech, outperforming models trained on tri-modal datasets. In the speech generation phase, a lightweight decoder is trained on speech tasks with direct preference optimization, enabling real-time emotional speech synthesis with high fidelity. Experiments show that \name surpasses state-of-the-art models across omnimodal, vision-language, and speech-language benchmarks. It achieves a 4-point absolute improvement on OmniBench over the leading open-source model VITA, despite using 5x fewer training samples and a smaller model size (7B vs. 7x8B). Additionally, \name achieves real-time speech generation with <1s latency at non-autoregressive mode, reducing inference time by 5x compared to autoregressive methods, and improves emotion classification accuracy by 7.7\%</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruilin Luo, Zhuofan Zheng, Yifan Wang, Yiyao Yu, Xinzhe Ni, Zicheng Lin, Jin Zeng, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is widely used to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The introduction of process supervision for CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on improving test-time scaling, thereby unlocking the System 2-style thinking capabilities of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving both deliberate reasoning and fine-grained verification. In this work, we propose a novel framework that introduces System 2-style thinking to multimodal mathematical reasoning. We introduce a three-module CoT data synthesis process that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. This process generates MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset. Furthermore, we implement a dual-view trajectory labeling automation that targets both visual grounding fidelity and deductive chain validity, resulting in the DualMath-1.1M dataset. The URSA-8B model, trained on MMathCoT-1M, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similarly sized multimodal LLMs on six popular reasoning benchmarks. Training URSA-8B further on the DualMath-1.1M dataset yields URSA-RM-8B, a verifier that enhances URSA-8B's test-time performance and surpasses strong closed-source multimodal MLLMs like GPT-4o.

<p>Abstract: The paper overviews the shared task on Real-Time Reverse Transliteration for Romanized Indo-Aryan languages. It focuses on the reverse transliteration of low-resourced languages in the Indo-Aryan family to their native scripts. Typing Romanized Indo-Aryan languages using ad-hoc transliterals and achieving accurate native scripts are complex and often inaccurate processes with the current keyboard systems. This task aims to introduce and evaluate a real-time reverse transliterator that converts Romanized Indo-Aryan languages to their native scripts, improving the typing experience for users. Out of 11 registered teams, four teams participated in the final evaluation phase with transliteration models for Sinhala, Hindi and Malayalam. These proposed solutions not only solve the issue of ad-hoc transliteration but also empower low-resource language usability in the digital arena.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive agents capable of understanding and executing instructions in the physical world have long been a central goal in AI research. The Minecraft Collaborative Building Task (MCBT) provides one such setting to work towards this goal (Narayan-Chen, Jayannavar, and Hockenmaier 2019). It is a two-player game in which an Architect (A) instructs a Builder (B) to construct a target structure in a simulated Blocks World Environment. We focus on the challenging Builder Action Prediction (BAP) subtask of predicting correct action sequences in a given multimodal game context with limited training data (Jayannavar, Narayan-Chen, and Hockenmaier 2020). We take a closer look at evaluation and data for the BAP task, discovering key challenges and making significant improvements on both fronts to propose BAP v2, an upgraded version of the task. This will allow future work to make more efficient and meaningful progress on it. It comprises of: (1) an enhanced evaluation benchmark that includes a cleaner test set and fairer, more insightful metrics, and (2) additional synthetic training data generated from novel Minecraft dialogue and target structure simulators emulating the MCBT. We show that the synthetic data can be used to train more performant and robust neural models even with relatively simple training methods. Looking ahead, such data could also be crucial for training more sophisticated, data-hungry deep transformer models and training/fine-tuning increasingly large LLMs. Although modeling is not the primary focus of this work, we also illustrate the impact of our data and training methodologies on a simple LLM- and transformer-based model, thus validating the robustness of our approach, and setting the stage for more advanced architectures and LLMs going forward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Andres Medina Florez, Shaina Raza, Rashida Lynn, Zahra Shakeri, Brendan T. Smith, Elham Dolatabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the prevalence, disparities, and symptom variations of Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC) for vulnerable populations is crucial to improving care and addressing intersecting inequities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into PCC research by leveraging NLP techniques to analyze disparities and variations in SDOH representation within PCC case reports. Following construction of a PCC Case Report Corpus, comprising over 7,000 case reports from the LitCOVID repository, a subset of 709 reports were annotated with 26 core SDOH-related entity types using pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models, human review, and data augmentation to improve quality, diversity and representation of entity types. An NLP pipeline integrating NER, natural language inference (NLI), trigram and frequency analyses was developed to extract and analyze these entities. Both encoder-only transformer models and RNN-based models were assessed for the NER objective.
  Fine-tuned encoder-only BERT models outperformed traditional RNN-based models in generalizability to distinct sentence structures and greater class sparsity. Exploratory analysis revealed variability in entity richness, with prevalent entities like condition, age, and access to care, and underrepresentation of sensitive categories like race and housing status. Trigram analysis highlighted frequent co-occurrences among entities, including age, gender, and condition. The NLI objective (entailment and contradiction analysis) showed attributes like "Experienced violence or abuse" and "Has medical insurance" had high entailment rates (82.4%-80.3%), while attributes such as "Is female-identifying," "Is married," and "Has a terminal condition" exhibited high contradiction rates (70.8%-98.5%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohitash Chandra, Guoxiang Ren,  Group-H</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an increasing concern about the prevalence of abusive and violent content in Hollywood movies. This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the longitudinal abuse and sentiment analysis of Hollywood Oscar and blockbuster movie dialogues from 1950 to 2024. By employing fine-tuned LLMs, we analyze subtitles for over a thousand movies categorised into four genres to examine the trends and shifts in emotional and abusive content over the past seven decades. Our findings reveal significant temporal changes in movie dialogues, which reflect broader social and cultural influences. Overall, the emotional tendencies in the films are diverse, and the detection of abusive content also exhibits significant fluctuations. The results show a gradual rise in abusive content in recent decades, reflecting social norms and regulatory policy changes. Genres such as thrillers still present a higher frequency of abusive content that emphasises the ongoing narrative role of violence and conflict. At the same time, underlying positive emotions such as humour and optimism remain prevalent in most of the movies. Furthermore, the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues has been significant over the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Verena Blaschke, Masha Fedzechkina, Maartje ter Hoeve</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer is a popular approach to increase the amount of training data for NLP tasks in a low-resource context. However, the best strategy to decide which cross-lingual data to include is unclear. Prior research often focuses on a small set of languages from a few language families and/or a single task. It is still an open question how these findings extend to a wider variety of languages and tasks. In this work, we analyze cross-lingual transfer for 266 languages from a wide variety of language families. Moreover, we include three popular NLP tasks: POS tagging, dependency parsing, and topic classification. Our findings indicate that the effect of linguistic similarity on transfer performance depends on a range of factors: the NLP task, the (mono- or multilingual) input representations, and the definition of linguistic similarity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menglong Cui, Pengzhi Gao, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown continuously improving multilingual capabilities, and even small-scale open-source models have demonstrated rapid performance enhancement. In this paper, we systematically explore the abilities of open LLMs with less than ten billion parameters to handle multilingual machine translation (MT) tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on six popular LLMs and find that models like Gemma2-9B exhibit impressive multilingual translation capabilities. We then introduce the Parallel-First Monolingual-Second (PFMS) data mixing strategy in the continual pretraining stage to further enhance the MT performance and present GemmaX2-28, a 9B model achieving top-tier multilingual translation performance across 28 languages. Specifically, GemmaX2-28 consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models such as TowerInstruct and XALMA and achieves competitive performance with Google Translate and GPT-4-turbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiming Ma, Xiayang Xiao, Sihao Dong, Peidong Wang, HaiPeng Wang, Qingyun Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: As a powerful all-weather Earth observation tool, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing enables critical military reconnaissance, maritime surveillance, and infrastructure monitoring. Although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SARChat.</p>

<p>Abstract: India is a diverse society with unique challenges in developing AI systems, including linguistic diversity, oral traditions, data accessibility, and scalability. Existing foundation models are primarily trained on English, limiting their effectiveness for India's population. Indic languages comprise only 1 percent of Common Crawl corpora despite India representing 18 percent of the global population, leading to linguistic biases. Thousands of regional languages, dialects, and code mixing create additional representation challenges due to sparse training data.
  We introduce Krutrim LLM, a 2 trillion token multilingual model designed for India's linguistic landscape. It incorporates the largest known Indic dataset, mitigating data scarcity and ensuring balanced performance across dialects. Krutrim outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models on Indic benchmarks while maintaining competitive English performance. Despite being significantly smaller in training flops, Krutrim LLM matches or exceeds models like LLAMA-2 on 10 out of 16 tasks, with an average score of 0.57 versus 0.55. This evidences Krutrim's flexible multilingual fluency across diverse linguistic contexts.
  Krutrim is integrated with real-time search to improve factual accuracy in conversational AI applications. This enhances accessibility for over 1 billion users worldwide. Through intentional design choices addressing data imbalances, Krutrim LLM signifies meaningful progress in building ethical, globally representative AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gokul Karthik Kumar, Iheb Chaabane, Kebin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in various visual benchmarks but are often constrained by the lack of high-quality visual fine-tuning data. To address this challenge, we introduce VisCon-100K, a novel dataset derived from interleaved image-text web documents. Our approach transforms 45K web documents from the OBELICS dataset into 100K image conversation samples. We utilize GPT-4V to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert these captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM performance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on fine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context, yielding superior results. We also discover that a 'leaky modality mix', where conversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its contextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q&A pairs. VisCon-100k dataset shows strong performance with two popular VLM approaches: text-only large language model (LLM) aligned with a vision encoder using image captions data (ShareGPT4V-7b) and multimodally pretrained LLM (IDEFICS2-8b) using interleaved image-text data. In addition to releasing the VisCon-100K dataset, we provide a contextual captioner trained on this dataset, facilitating scalable fine-tuning data generation for future research and open-source applications. Using the same pipeline, but substituting our trained contextual captioner for GPT-4V, we also release the larger VisCon-1M dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Huo, Yibo Yan, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Xin Zou, Zhihua Wei, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Machine Unlearning (MU) has introduced solutions for the selective removal of private or sensitive information encoded within deep neural networks. Nonetheless, MU for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains in its nascent phase. Therefore, we propose to reformulate the task of multimodal MU in the era of MLLMs, which aims to erase only the visual patterns associated with a given entity while preserving the corresponding textual knowledge encoded within the original parameters of the language model backbone. Furthermore, we develop a novel geometry-constrained gradient descent method MMUnlearner. It updates the weights of MLLMs with a weight saliency map jointly restricted by the remaining concepts and textual knowledge during unlearning, thereby preserving parameters essential for non-target knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMUnlearner surpasses baselines that finetuning MLLMs with VQA data directly through Gradient Ascent (GA) or Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), across all evaluation dimensions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanli Yang, Fei Sun, Jiajun Tan, Xinyu Ma, Qi Cao, Dawei Yin, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite near-perfect results in artificial evaluations, the effectiveness of model editing in real-world applications remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose to study model editing in question answering (QA) by establishing a rigorous evaluation practice to assess the effectiveness of editing methods in correcting LLMs' errors. It consists of QAEdit, a new benchmark derived from popular QA datasets, and a standardized evaluation framework. Our single editing experiments indicate that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. ~96%). Through module analysis and controlled experiments, we demonstrate that this performance decline stems from issues in evaluation practices of prior editing research. One key issue is the inappropriate use of teacher forcing in testing prevents error propagation by feeding ground truth tokens (inaccessible in real-world scenarios) as input. Furthermore, we simulate real-world deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. Our analysis provides a fundamental reexamination of both the real-world applicability of existing model editing methods and their evaluation practices, and establishes a rigorous evaluation framework with key insights to advance reliable and practical model editing research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid rise of AI-generated content has made detecting disinformation increasingly challenging. In particular, multimodal disinformation, i.e., online posts-articles that contain images and texts with fabricated information are specially designed to deceive. While existing AI safety benchmarks primarily address bias and toxicity, multimodal disinformation detection remains largely underexplored. To address this challenge, we present the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark VLDBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for detecting disinformation across both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text and image) content, comprising 31,000} news article-image pairs, spanning 13 distinct categories, for robust evaluation. VLDBench features a rigorous semi-automated data curation pipeline, with 22 domain experts dedicating 300 plus hours} to annotation, achieving a strong inter-annotator agreement (Cohen kappa = 0.78). We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that integrating textual and visual cues in multimodal news posts improves disinformation detection accuracy by 5 - 35 % compared to unimodal models. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks such as the EU AI Act, NIST guidelines, and the MIT AI Risk Repository 2024, VLDBench is expected to become a benchmark for detecting disinformation in online multi-modal contents. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Complex instruction-following with elaborate constraints is imperative for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing methods have constructed data for complex instruction alignment, they all rely on a more advanced model, especially GPT-4, limiting their application. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Self-Contrastive Training (MuSC) framework, to improve the complex instruction alignment without relying on a stronger model. Our method is conducted on both coarse and fine granularity. On coarse-granularity, we construct constraint-aware preference data based on instruction decomposition and recombination. On fine-granularity, we perform token-aware preference optimization with dynamic token-level supervision. Our method is evaluated on open-sourced models, and experiment results show our method achieves significant improvement on both complex and general instruction-following benchmarks, surpassing previous self-alignment methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The escalating volume of academic research, coupled with a shortage of qualified reviewers, necessitates innovative approaches to peer review. While large language model (LLMs) offer potential for automating this process, their current limitations include superficial critiques, hallucinations, and a lack of actionable insights. This research addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI-generated reviews, that measures alignment with human evaluations, verifies factual accuracy, assesses analytical depth, and identifies actionable insights. We also propose a novel alignment mechanism that tailors LLM-generated reviews to the unique evaluation priorities of individual conferences and journals. To enhance the quality of these reviews, we introduce a self-refinement loop that iteratively optimizes the LLM's review prompts. Our framework establishes standardized metrics for evaluating AI-based review systems, thereby bolstering the reliability of AI-generated reviews in academic research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianshu Zhang, Dongyu Yao, Renjie Pi, Paul Pu Liang, Yi R. Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: Visually linking matching cues is a crucial ability in daily life, such as identifying the same person in multiple photos based on their cues, even without knowing who they are. Despite the extensive knowledge that vision-language models (VLMs) possess, it remains largely unexplored whether they are capable of performing this fundamental task. To address this, we introduce VLM$^2$-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess whether VLMs can Visually Link Matching cues, with 9 subtasks and over 3,000 test cases. Comprehensive evaluation across eight open-source VLMs and GPT-4o, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models' ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap where even GPT-4o lags 34.80% behind humans. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating language-based reasoning in vision-centric tasks to prevent unnecessary biases, and (iii) shifting vision-text training paradigms toward fostering models' ability to independently structure and infer relationships among visual cues.</p>

<p>Abstract: An increasingly prevalent socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessing and enhancing human learning through question-answering is vital, yet automating this process remains challenging. While large language models (LLMs) excel at summarization and query responses, their ability to generate meaningful questions for learners is underexplored.
  We propose Savaal, a scalable question-generation system with three objectives: (i) scalability, enabling question generation from hundreds of pages of text (ii) depth of understanding, producing questions beyond factual recall to test conceptual reasoning, and (iii) domain-independence, automatically generating questions across diverse knowledge areas. Instead of providing an LLM with large documents as context, Savaal improves results with a three-stage processing pipeline. Our evaluation with 76 human experts on 71 papers and PhD dissertations shows that Savaal generates questions that better test depth of understanding by 6.5X for dissertations and 1.5X for papers compared to a direct-prompting LLM baseline. Notably, as document length increases, Savaal's advantages in higher question quality and lower cost become more pronounced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangying Shao, Yanfu Yan, Denys Poshyvanyk, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based code generation has completely transformed the way developers write programs today. Existing approaches to code generation have focused either on the Sequence-to-Sequence paradigm, which generates target code as a sequence of tokens, or the Sequence-to-Tree paradigm, which outputs code as a sequence of actions. While these two paradigms are intuitively complementary, their combination has not been previously explored. By comparing the code generated under these two paradigms, we find that integrating them holds significant potential. In this paper, we propose UniGenCoder for code-related generation tasks, which consists of a shared encoder, a shared decoder with a minimal set of additional parameters to unify two paradigms, and a selector that dynamically chooses optimal paradigm for each instance. Also, during the model training, we first perform the multi-task learning and distillation strategies to facilitate knowledge transfer between two paradigms, and then leverage contrastive learning to train the selector. Experimental results on the text-to-code and code-to-code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We release our code at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/UniGenCoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate symbolic world models from textual descriptions. Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs as world models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfonso Amayuelas, Joy Sain, Simerjot Kaur, Charese Smiley</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are valuable tools for representing relationships between entities in a structured format. Traditionally, these knowledge bases are queried to extract specific information. However, question-answering (QA) over such KGs poses a challenge due to the intrinsic complexity of natural language compared to the structured format and the size of these graphs. Despite these challenges, the structured nature of KGs can provide a solid foundation for grounding the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering organizations increased reliability and control.
  Recent advancements in LLMs have introduced reasoning methods at inference time to improve their performance and maximize their capabilities. In this work, we propose integrating these reasoning strategies with KGs to anchor every step or "thought" of the reasoning chains in KG data. Specifically, we evaluate both agentic and automated search methods across several reasoning strategies, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), using GRBench, a benchmark dataset for graph reasoning with domain-specific graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline models, highlighting the benefits of grounding LLM reasoning processes in structured KG data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burc Gokden</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilong Chen, Junyuan Shang, Zhenyu Zhang, Yanxi Xie, Jiawei Sheng, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face inherent performance bottlenecks under parameter constraints, particularly in processing critical tokens that demand complex reasoning. Empirical analysis reveals challenging tokens induce abrupt gradient spikes across layers, exposing architectural stress points in standard Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose Inner Thinking Transformer (ITT), which reimagines layer computations as implicit thinking steps. ITT dynamically allocates computation through Adaptive Token Routing, iteratively refines representations via Residual Thinking Connections, and distinguishes reasoning phases using Thinking Step Encoding. ITT enables deeper processing of critical tokens without parameter expansion. Evaluations across 162M-466M parameter models show ITT achieves 96.5\% performance of a 466M Transformer using only 162M parameters, reduces training data by 43.2\%, and outperforms Transformer/Loop variants in 11 benchmarks. By enabling elastic computation allocation during inference, ITT balances performance and efficiency through architecture-aware optimization of implicit thinking pathways.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenglai Zeng, Pengfei He, Kai Guo, Tianqi Zheng, Hanqing Lu, Yue Xing, Hui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external contexts, such as through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), often face challenges in handling imperfect evidence. They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Jafari, Devin Yuncheng Hua, Hao Xue, Flora Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language interaction with agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), is expected to remain a dominant paradigm in the near future. While humans instinctively align their communication with mental states -- an ability known as Theory of Mind (ToM), current LLM powered systems exhibit significant limitations in this regard. This study examines the extent to which open source language models (LLaMA) can capture and preserve ToM related information and how effectively it contributes to consistent ToM reasoning in generated responses. We further investigate whether explicit manipulation of ToM related components, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, can enhance response alignment. Experiments on two LLaMA 3 variants demonstrate that incorporating ToM informed alignment improves response quality, achieving win rates of 67 and 63 percent for the 3B and 8B models, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of ToM driven strategies to improve alignment in LLM based conversational agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amalie Brogaard Pauli, Isabelle Augenstein, Ira Assent</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs make it easy to rewrite text in any style, be it more polite, persuasive, or more positive. We present a large-scale study of evaluation metrics for style and attribute transfer with a focus on content preservation; meaning content not attributed to the style shift is preserved. The de facto evaluation approach uses lexical or semantic similarity metrics often between source sentences and rewrites. While these metrics are not designed to distinguish between style or content differences, empirical meta-evaluation shows a reasonable correlation to human judgment. In fact, recent works find that LLMs prompted as evaluators are only comparable to semantic similarity metrics, even though intuitively, the LLM approach should better fit the task. To investigate this discrepancy, we benchmark 8 metrics for evaluating content preservation on existing datasets and additionally construct a new test set that better aligns with the meta-evaluation aim. Indeed, we then find that the empirical conclusion aligns with the intuition: content preservation metrics for style/attribute transfer must be conditional on the style shift. To support this, we propose a new efficient zero-shot evaluation method using the likelihood of the next token. We hope our meta-evaluation can foster more research on evaluating content preservation metrics, and also to ensure fair evaluation of methods for conducting style transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaohua Tang, Zhicheng Hu, Kun Cheng, Fan Mo, Qiheng Lv, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that public companies file financial reports tagging numbers with the machine readable inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL) standard. However, the highly complex and highly granular taxonomy defined by iXBRL limits label transferability across domains. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Financial Key Performance Indicator (HiFi-KPI) dataset, designed to facilitate numerical KPI extraction at specified levels of granularity from unstructured financial text. Our approach organizes a 218,126-label hierarchy using a taxonomy based grouping method, investigating which taxonomy layer provides the most meaningful structure. HiFi-KPI comprises ~1.8M paragraphs and ~5M entities, each linked to a label in the iXBRL-specific calculation and presentation taxonomies. We provide baselines using encoder-based approaches and structured extraction using Large Language Models (LLMs). To simplify LLM inference and evaluation, we additionally release HiFi-KPI Lite, a manually curated subset with four expert-mapped labels. We publicly release all artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced RWKV architecture with adaptive temporal gating mechanisms for improved long-context language modeling. We propose two principal innovations: (1) a position-aware convolutional shift operator that captures local syntactic patterns while preserving global coherence, and (2) a neurally-gated information routing mechanism that dynamically regulates inter-token information flow. Through comprehensive experiments on text generation tasks, our enhanced model demonstrates superior performance compared to the baseline RWKV, achieving 96.5 relative improvement in ROUGE-L scores with only 2.95 increased inference latency. Ablation studies validate the individual contributions of each component, while linguistic analysis reveals the model's adaptive attention to syntactic boundaries and entity coherence. The proposed modifications maintain RWKV's linear computational complexity while significantly enhancing its contextual modeling capabilities, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for recurrent-style architectures in long-form text generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) is a leaderboard to benchmark the performance of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models on various speech processing tasks. However, SUPERB largely considers English speech in its evaluation. This paper presents multilingual SUPERB (ML-SUPERB), covering 143 languages (ranging from high-resource to endangered), and considering both automatic speech recognition and language identification. Following the concept of SUPERB, ML-SUPERB utilizes frozen SSL features and employs a simple framework for multilingual tasks by learning a shallow downstream model. Similar to the SUPERB benchmark, we find speech SSL models can significantly improve performance compared to FBANK features. Furthermore, we find that multilingual models do not always perform better than their monolingual counterparts. We will release ML-SUPERB as a challenge with organized datasets and reproducible training scripts for future multilingual representation research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sen Yang, Xin Li, Leyang Cui, Lidong Bing, Wai Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Two lines of approaches are adopted for complex reasoning with LLMs. One line of work prompts LLMs with various reasoning structures, while the structural outputs can be naturally regarded as intermediate reasoning steps. Another line of work adopt LLM-free declarative solvers to do the reasoning task, rendering higher reasoning accuracy but lacking interpretability due to the black-box nature of the solvers. Aiming to resolve the trade-off between answer accuracy and interpretability, we present a simple extension to the latter line of work. Specifically, we showcase that the intermediate search logs generated by Prolog interpreters can be accessed and interpreted into human-readable reasoning proofs. As long as LLMs correctly translate problem descriptions into Prolog representations, the corresponding reasoning proofs are ensured to be causal and reliable. On two logical reasoning and one arithmetic reasoning datasets, our framework obtains significant improvements in terms of both answer accuracy and reasoning proof accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyin Sun, Yuxiang Ren, Jiehao Chen, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxu Xu, Yitian Yuan, Qiudan Zhang, Wenhui Wu, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma, Xu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

<p>Abstract: Trading range breakout is a key method in the technical analysis of financial trading, widely employed by traders in financial markets such as stocks, futures, and foreign exchange. However, distinguishing between true and false breakout and providing the correct rationale cause significant challenges to investors. Traditional quantitative methods require large amounts of data and cannot directly present the reasoning process, making them less than perfect in this field. Recently, large language models have achieved success in various downstream applications, but their effectiveness in the domain of financial breakout detection has been subpar. The reason is that the unique data and specific knowledge are required in breakout detection. To address these issues, we create the first financial breakout dataset and introduce FinLLM-B, the premier large language model for financial breakout detection, which enhances the effectiveness of breakout trading strategies. Furthermore, we have developed a novel framework for large language models, namely multi-stage structure, effectively reducing mistakes in downstream applications. Experimental results indicate that compared to GPT-3.5, FinLLM-B improves the average accuracy of answers and rational by 49.97%, with the multi-stage structure contributing 9.72% to the improvement. Additionally, it outperforms ChatGPT-4 by 42.38%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can advanced multi-modal models effectively tackle complex web-based tasks? Such tasks are often found on crowdsourcing platforms, where crowdworkers engage in challenging micro-tasks within web-based environments.
  Building on this idea, we present TurkingBench, a benchmark consisting of tasks presented as web pages with textual instructions and multi-modal contexts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on artificially synthesized web pages, our benchmark uses natural HTML pages originally designed for crowdsourcing workers to perform various annotation tasks. Each task's HTML instructions are instantiated with different values derived from crowdsourcing tasks, creating diverse instances. This benchmark includes 32.2K instances spread across 158 tasks.
  To support the evaluation of TurkingBench, we have developed a framework that links chatbot responses to actions on web pages (e.g., modifying a text box, selecting a radio button). We assess the performance of cutting-edge private and open-source models, including language-only and vision-language models (such as GPT4 and InternVL), on this benchmark. Our results show that while these models outperform random chance, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that this benchmark will drive progress in the evaluation and development of web-based agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Light curves serve as a valuable source of information on stellar formation and evolution. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Ong, Amjad Almahairi, Vincent Wu, Wei-Lin Chiang, Tianhao Wu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, M Waleed Kadous, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet the choice of which model to use often involves a trade-off between performance and cost. More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Yu Zhang, Arun Verma, Finale Doshi-Velez, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in decision-making, but their reliability, especially in critical tasks like healthcare, is not well-established. Therefore, understanding how LLMs reason and make decisions is crucial for their safe deployment. This paper investigates how the uncertainty of responses generated by LLMs relates to the information provided in the input prompt. Leveraging the insight that LLMs learn to infer latent concepts during pretraining, we propose a prompt-response concept model that explains how LLMs generate responses and helps understand the relationship between prompts and response uncertainty. We show that the uncertainty decreases as the prompt's informativeness increases, similar to epistemic uncertainty. Our detailed experimental results on real-world datasets validate our proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Duong Le, Xin Xia, Zhang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery aims to identify causal relationships between variables and is a critical research area in machine learning. Traditional methods focus on statistical or machine learning algorithms to uncover causal links from structured data, often overlooking the valuable contextual information provided by metadata. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in creating unified causal discovery frameworks by incorporating both structured data and metadata. However, their potential in multi-agent settings remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Framework (MAC), which consists of two key modules: the Debate-Coding Module (DCM) and the Meta-Debate Module (MDM). The DCM begins with a multi-agent debating and coding process, where agents use both structured data and metadata to collaboratively select the most suitable statistical causal discovery (SCD) method. The selected SCD is then applied to the structured data to generate an initial causal graph. This causal graph is transformed into causal metadata through the Meta Fusion mechanism. With all the metadata, MDM then refines the causal structure by leveraging a multi-agent debating framework. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that MAC outperforms both traditional statistical causal discovery methods and existing LLM-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Tang, Ye Liu, Xi Zhao, Xukai Liu, Yanghai Zhang, Kai Zhang, Xiaofang Zhou, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel Aboah Boateng, Cassiano O. Becker, Nabiha Asghar, Kabir Walia, Ashwin Srinivasan, Ehi Nosakhare, Soundar Srinivasan, Victor Dibia</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand-crafting high quality prompts to optimize the performance of language models is a complicated and labor-intensive process. Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihang Li, Jin Huang, Jiaxi Zhuang, Yaorui Shi, Xiaochen Cai, Mingjun Xu, Xiang Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Hengxing Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.
  To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Hanzi Mao, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Lawson, Lucy Farnik, Conor Houghton, Laurence Aitchison</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach to interpreting the internal representations of transformer language models. However, SAEs are usually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to use them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem, we introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual stream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual stream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE latents to 'switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers. Interestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single layer for a given token or prompt, but the layer at which an individual latent is active may differ for different tokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over layers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the distributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of magnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token. For larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at multiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual stream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar. Finally, we relax the assumption that the residual stream basis is the same at every layer by applying pre-trained tuned-lens transformations, but our findings remain qualitatively similar. Our results represent a new approach to understanding how representations change as they flow through transformers. We release our code to train and analyze MLSAEs at https://github.com/tim-lawson/mlsae.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liqiang Jing, Zhehui Huang, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Hongming Zhang, Xinya Du, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive language/vision reasoning abilities, igniting the recent trend of building agents for targeted applications such as shopping assistants or AI software engineers. Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, LVLMs, and agents shows that they struggle with most tasks, with the best agent solving only 34.12% of data analysis tasks and achieving a 34.74% Relative Performance Gap (RPG). These findings underscore the need for further advancements in developing more practical, intelligent, and autonomous data science agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Bjorck, Alon Benhaim, Vishrav Chaudhary, Furu Wei, Xia Song</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art LLMs are powered by scaling -- scaling model size, dataset size and cluster size. It is economically infeasible to extensively tune hyperparameter for the largest runs. Instead, approximately optimal hyperparameters must be inferred or \textit{transferred} from smaller experiments. Hyperparameter transfer across model sizes has been studied in Yang et al. However, hyperparameter transfer across dataset size -- or token horizon -- has not been studied yet. To remedy this we conduct a large scale empirical study on how optimal learning rate (LR) depends on token horizon in LLM training. We first demonstrate that the optimal LR changes significantly with token horizon -- longer training necessitates smaller LR. Secondly we demonstrate the the optimal LR follows a scaling law, and that the optimal LR for longer horizons can be accurately estimated from shorter horizons via such scaling laws. We also provide a rule-of-thumb for transferring LR across token horizons with zero overhead over current practices. Lastly we provide evidence that LLama-1 used too high LR, and estimate the performance hit from this. We thus argue that hyperparameter transfer across data size is an important and overlooked component of LLM training.</p>

<p>Abstract: As LLMs become capable of complex tasks, there is growing potential for personalized interactions tailored to the subtle and idiosyncratic preferences of the user. We present a public benchmark, PersonalLLM, focusing on adapting LLMs to provide maximal benefits for a particular user. Departing from existing alignment benchmarks that implicitly assume uniform preferences, we curate open-ended prompts paired with many high-quality answers over which users would be expected to display heterogeneous latent preferences. Instead of persona-prompting LLMs based on high-level attributes (e.g., user's race or response length), which yields homogeneous preferences relative to humans, we develop a method that can simulate a large user base with diverse preferences from a set of pre-trained reward models. Our dataset and generated personalities offer an innovative testbed for developing personalization algorithms that grapple with continual data sparsity--few relevant feedback from the particular user--by leveraging historical data from other (similar) users. We explore basic in-context learning and meta-learning baselines to illustrate the utility of PersonalLLM and highlight the need for future methodological development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Yue Liao, Jianhui Liu, Ruifei He, Haoru Tan, Shiming Zhang, Hongsheng Li, Si Liu, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts large language models (MoE-LLMs) marks a significant step forward of language models, however, they encounter two critical challenges in practice: 1) expert parameters lead to considerable memory consumption and loading latency; and 2) the current activated experts are redundant, as many tokens may only require a single expert. Motivated by these issues, we investigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts exhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores, and activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not all tokens are equally important -- only a small subset is critical. Building on these insights, we propose MC, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to achieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading overheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization, which formulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming problem, where the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance of each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning, which identifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts for other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining performance. Our MC integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to collaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy loss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, at 2.54 bits, MC compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average accuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters by 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghaith Hammouri, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new vulnerability that exploits fixed points in autoregressive models and use it to craft queries that never halt. More precisely, for non-halting queries, the LLM never samples the end-of-string token <eos>. We rigorously analyze the conditions under which the non-halting anomaly presents itself. In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating (cyclic) token sequence is observed at the output beyond the context size, then the LLM does not halt.
  We demonstrate non-halting queries in many experiments performed in base unaligned models where repeating prompts immediately lead to a non-halting cyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple recipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates a prompt structure to target aligned models. We demonstrate the recipe's success in sending every major model released over the past year into a non-halting state with the same simple prompt even over higher temperatures. Further, we devise an experiment with 100 randomly selected tokens and show that the recipe to create non-halting queries succeeds with high success rates ranging from 97% for GPT-4o to 19% for Gemini Pro 1.5. These results show that the proposed adversarial recipe succeeds in bypassing alignment at one to two orders of magnitude higher rates compared to earlier reports.
  We also study gradient-based direct inversion using ARCA to craft new short prompts to induce the non-halting state. We inverted 10,000 random repeating 2-cycle outputs for llama-3.1-8b-instruct. Out of 10,000 three-token inverted prompts 1,512 yield non-halting queries reaching a rate of 15%. Our experiments with ARCA show that non-halting may be easily induced with as few as 3 input tokens with high probability. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that non-halting queries are prevalent and relatively easy to find.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Chen, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, but their performance on long-context tasks is often limited by the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach to accelerate attention computation in LLMs, particularly for long-context scenarios. We leverage the inherent sparsity within attention mechanisms, both in conventional Softmax attention and ReLU attention (with $\mathsf{ReLU}^\alpha$ activation, $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}_+$), to significantly reduce the running time complexity. Our method employs a Half-Space Reporting (HSR) data structure to identify non-zero or ``massively activated'' entries in the attention matrix. We present theoretical analyses for two key scenarios: generation decoding and prompt prefilling. Our approach achieves a running time of $O(mn^{4/5})$ significantly faster than the naive approach $O(mn)$ for generation decoding, where $n$ is the context length, $m$ is the query length, and $d$ is the hidden dimension. We can also reduce the running time for prompt prefilling from $O(mn)$ to $O(mn^{1 - 1 / \lfloor d/2\rfloor} + mn^{4/5})$. Our method introduces only provably negligible error for Softmax attention. This work represents a significant step towards enabling efficient long-context processing in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongfu Liu, Hengguan Huang, Xiangming Gu, Hao Wang, Ye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for generating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many domains now employ AI-based decision-making aids, and although the potential for AI systems to assist with decision making is much discussed, human-AI collaboration often underperforms due to factors such as (mis)trust in the AI system and beliefs about AI being incapable of completing subjective tasks. One potential tool for influencing human decision making is performance pressure, which hasn't been much studied in interaction with human-AI decision making. In this work, we examine how pressure and explainable AI (XAI) techniques interact with AI advice-taking behavior. Using an inherently low-stakes task (spam review classification), we demonstrate effective and simple methods to apply pressure and influence human AI advice-taking behavior by manipulating financial incentives and imposing time limits. Our results show complex interaction effects, with different combinations of pressure and XAI techniques either improving or worsening AI advice taking behavior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these interactions, strategies to effectively use pressure, and encourage future research to incorporate pressure analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchun Wang, Yuanzhou Chen, Zichuan Liu, Zhanwen Chen, Haifeng Chen, Xiang Zhang, Wei Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengke Zou, Xingang Guo, Rui Yang, Junyu Zhang, Bin Hu, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Garg, Trilok Padhi, Hemang Jain, Ugur Kursuncu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiran You, Hongyang Du, Kaibin Huang, Abbas Jamalipour</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing deployment in wireless networks for a wide variety of user services. However, the growing longer prompt setting highlights the crucial issue of computational resource demands and huge communication load. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at user devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity and low bit error rates while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services. The system reduces response time by about 17%, with the improvement varying based on the length of the original prompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weishun Zhong, Tankut Can, Antonis Georgiou, Ilya Shnayderman, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Gao, Chenhao Zhang, Fengge Wu, Junsuo Zhao, Changwen Zheng, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{REFA}$, a family of reference-free alignment methods that optimize over multiple user preferences while enforcing fine-grained length control. Our approach integrates deviation-based weighting to emphasize high-quality responses, length normalization to prevent trivial short-response solutions, and an EOS-probability regularizer to mitigate dataset-induced brevity biases. Theoretically, we show that under the Uncertainty Reduction with Sequence Length Assertion (URSLA) framework, naive length normalization can still incentivize length-based shortcuts. In contrast, REFA corrects these subtle incentives, guiding models toward genuinely more informative and higher-quality outputs. Empirically, REFA achieves a new $\textbf{state-of-the-art}$ among reference-free alignment methods, generating richer responses that align more closely with human preferences. Notably, REFA improves performance on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark, achieving a $\textbf{26.6%}$ Length-Controlled Win Rate (LC-WR) and $\textbf{24.2%}$ Win Rate (WR).</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18148">Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Sun, Zongmin Zhang, Xinyue Shen, Ziyi Zhang, Yule Liu, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayuan Fu, Keqing He, Yejie Wang, Wentao Hong, Zhuoma Gongque, Weihao Zeng, Wei Wang, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Weiran Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have proved their ability to perform complex tasks like humans. However, there is still a large gap between open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight, we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference. Our findings establish the correlation between agent generalization and self-refinement and provide a new paradigm for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiujie Song, Xiaoyi Pang, Haifeng Tang, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q. Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying image complexity at the entity level is straightforward, but the assessment of semantic complexity has been largely overlooked. In fact, there are differences in semantic complexity across images. Images with richer semantics can tell vivid and engaging stories and offer a wide range of application scenarios. For example, the Cookie Theft picture is such a kind of image and is widely used to assess human language and cognitive abilities due to its higher semantic complexity. Additionally, semantically rich images can benefit the development of vision models, as images with limited semantics are becoming less challenging for them. However, such images are scarce, highlighting the need for a greater number of them. For instance, there is a need for more images like Cookie Theft to cater to people from different cultural backgrounds and eras. Assessing semantic complexity requires human experts and empirical evidence. Automatic evaluation of how semantically rich an image will be the first step of mining or generating more images with rich semantics, and benefit human cognitive assessment, Artificial Intelligence, and various other applications. In response, we propose the Image Semantic Assessment (ISA) task to address this problem. We introduce the first ISA dataset and a novel method that leverages language to solve this vision problem. Experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subset Deep Learning (DL), has profoundly impacted numerous domains, including autonomous driving. The integration of autonomous driving in military settings reduces human casualties and enables precise and safe execution of missions in hazardous environments while allowing for reliable logistics support without the risks associated with fatigue-related errors. However, relying on autonomous driving solely requires an advanced decision-making model that is adaptable and optimum in any situation. Considering the presence of numerous interconnected autonomous vehicles in mission-critical scenarios, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is vital for ensuring seamless coordination, real-time data exchange, and instantaneous response to dynamic driving environments. The advent of 6G strengthens the Internet of Automated Defense Vehicles (IoADV) concept within the realm of Internet of Military Defense Things (IoMDT) by enabling robust connectivity, crucial for real-time data exchange, advanced navigation, and enhanced safety features through IoADV interactions. On the other hand, a critical advancement in this space is using pre-trained Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making and communication optimization for autonomous driving. Hence, this work presents opportunities and challenges with a vision of realizing the full potential of these technologies in critical defense applications, especially through the advancement of IoADV and its role in enhancing autonomous military operations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have established Transformer architectures as the predominant modeling paradigm. Central to the success of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which scores the similarity between query and key matrices to modulate a value matrix. This operation bears striking similarities to digraph convolution, prompting an investigation into whether digraph convolution could serve as an alternative to self-attention. In this study, we formalize this concept by introducing a synthetic unitary digraph convolution based on the digraph Fourier transform. The resulting model, which we term Converter, effectively converts a Transformer into a Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) form. We have tested Converter on Long-Range Arena benchmark, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that Converter achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency and architectural simplicity, which establishes it as a lightweight yet powerful Transformer variant.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-based large language models (LLMs), particularly in the GPT series and the o1 model, have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling both training-time and inference-time compute. However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Anil Ramakrishna, Mingyi Hong, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurush Hiranandani, Haolun Wu, Subhojyoti Mukherjee, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Many commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) are often closed-source, limiting developers to prompt tuning for aligning content generation with specific applications. While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to \emph{Plugin} model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly intertwined with daily life, assisting users in executing various tasks and providing guidance on decision-making. This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation, where such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional vulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized controlled trial with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) employing explicit psychological tactics to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' decision patterns and shifts in their preference ratings post-interaction, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly, across both decision-making domains, participants interacting with the manipulative agents shifted toward harmful options at substantially higher rates (financial, MA: 62.3%, SEMA: 59.6%; emotional, MA: 42.3%, SEMA: 41.5%) compared to the NA group (financial, 35.8%; emotional, 12.8%). Notably, our findings reveal that even subtle manipulative objectives (MA) can be as effective as employing explicit psychological strategies (SEMA) in swaying human decision-making. By revealing the potential for covert AI influence, this study highlights a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies and protect human autonomy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 19 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents.

<p>Abstract: We present Step-Video-T2V, a state-of-the-art text-to-video pre-trained model with 30B parameters and the ability to generate videos up to 204 frames in length. A deep compression Variational Autoencoder, Video-VAE, is designed for video generation tasks, achieving 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression ratios, while maintaining exceptional video reconstruction quality. User prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English and Chinese. A DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is employed to denoise input noise into latent frames. A video-based DPO approach, Video-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the generated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key observations and insights. Step-Video-T2V's performance is evaluated on a novel video generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, demonstrating its state-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and commercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current diffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video foundation models. We make both Step-Video-T2V and Step-Video-T2V-Eval available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Video-T2V. The online version can be accessed from https://yuewen.cn/videos as well. Our goal is to accelerate the innovation of video foundation models and empower video content creators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shao Zhang, Xihuai Wang, Wenhao Zhang, Chaoran Li, Junru Song, Tingyu Li, Lin Qiu, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai, Wen Yao, Weinan Zhang, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Foster, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sifan Zhou, Shuo Wang, Zhihang Yuan, Mingjia Shi, Yuzhang Shang, Dawei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning technologies have achieved remarkable results. However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14560">Less is More: Improving LLM Alignment via Preference Data Selection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Deng, Han Zhong, Rui Ai, Fuli Feng, Zheng Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To accurately estimate margins for data selection, we propose a dual-margin guided approach that considers both external reward margins and implicit DPO reward margins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reduces computational cost dramatically while improving performance. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama and Mistral series models on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, while further reducing training time. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14943">GenAI vs. Human Fact-Checkers: Accurate Ratings, Flawed Rationales</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuehong Cassandra Tai, Khushi Navin Patni, Nicholas Daniel Hemauer, Bruce Desmarais, Yu-Ru Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15210">PairBench: A Systematic Framework for Selecting Reliable Judge VLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aarash Feizi, Sai Rajeswar, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Reihaneh Rabbany, Spandana Gella, Valentina Zantedeschi, Jo\~ao Monteiro</p>
<p>Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, understanding their ability to effectively compare data pairs as instructed in the prompt becomes essential. To address this, we present PairBench, a low-cost framework that systematically evaluates VLMs as customizable similarity tools across various modalities and scenarios. Through PairBench, we introduce four metrics that represent key desiderata of similarity scores: alignment with human annotations, consistency for data pairs irrespective of their order, smoothness of similarity distributions, and controllability through prompting. Our analysis demonstrates that no model, whether closed- or open-source, is superior on all metrics; the optimal choice depends on an auto evaluator's desired behavior (e.g., a smooth vs. a sharp judge), highlighting risks of widespread adoption of VLMs as evaluators without thorough assessment. For instance, the majority of VLMs struggle with maintaining symmetric similarity scores regardless of order. Additionally, our results show that the performance of VLMs on the metrics in PairBench closely correlates with popular benchmarks, showcasing its predictive power in ranking models.</p>
