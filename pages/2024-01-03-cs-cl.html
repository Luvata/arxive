<p>With the rapid evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language
Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have emerged as powerful tools capable of
transforming various sectors. Their vast knowledge base and dynamic interaction
capabilities represent significant potential in improving education by
operating as a personalized assistant. However, the possibility of generating
incorrect, biased, or unhelpful answers are a key challenge to resolve when
deploying LLMs in an education context. This work introduces an innovative
architecture that combines the strengths of ChatGPT with a traditional
information retrieval based chatbot framework to offer enhanced student support
in higher education. Our empirical evaluations underscore the high promise of
this approach.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00139">Is Knowledge All Large Language Models Needed for Causal Reasoning?. (arXiv:2401.00139v1 [cs.AI])</a></h1>

<p>This paper explores the causal reasoning of large language models (LLMs) to
enhance their interpretability and reliability in advancing artificial
intelligence. Despite the proficiency of LLMs in a range of tasks, their
potential for understanding causality requires further exploration. We propose
a novel causal attribution model that utilizes "do-operators" for constructing
counterfactual scenarios, allowing us to systematically quantify the influence
of input numerical data and LLMs' pre-existing knowledge on their causal
reasoning processes. Our newly developed experimental setup assesses LLMs'
reliance on contextual information and inherent knowledge across various
domains. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs' causal reasoning ability depends on
the context and domain-specific knowledge provided, and supports the argument
that "knowledge is, indeed, what LLMs principally require for sound causal
reasoning". On the contrary, in the absence of knowledge, LLMs still maintain a
degree of causal reasoning using the available numerical data, albeit with
limitations in the calculations.

<p>Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) aims to seek answer entities
for the natural language question from a large-scale Knowledge Graph~(KG). To
better perform reasoning on KG, recent work typically adopts a pre-trained
language model~(PLM) to model the question, and a graph neural network~(GNN)
based module to perform multi-hop reasoning on the KG. Despite the
effectiveness, due to the divergence in model architecture, the PLM and GNN are
not closely integrated, limiting the knowledge sharing and fine-grained feature
interactions. To solve it, we aim to simplify the above two-module approach,
and develop a more capable PLM that can directly support subgraph reasoning for
KGQA, namely ReasoningLM. In our approach, we propose a subgraph-aware
self-attention mechanism to imitate the GNN for performing structured
reasoning, and also adopt an adaptation tuning strategy to adapt the model
parameters with 20,000 subgraphs with synthesized questions. After adaptation,
the PLM can be parameter-efficient fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Experiments
show that ReasoningLM surpasses state-of-the-art models by a large margin, even
with fewer updated parameters and less training data. Our codes and data are

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00165">Mitigating the Impact of False Negatives in Dense Retrieval with Contrastive Confidence Regularization. (arXiv:2401.00165v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wang_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Shiqi Wang</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhang_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yeqin Zhang</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Nguyen_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Cam-Tu Nguyen</a></p>
<p>In open-domain Question Answering (QA), dense retrieval is crucial for
finding relevant passages for answer generation. Typically, contrastive
learning is used to train a retrieval model that maps passages and queries to
the same semantic space. The objective is to make similar ones closer and
dissimilar ones further apart. However, training such a system is challenging
due to the false negative issue, where relevant passages may be missed during
data annotation. Hard negative sampling, which is commonly used to improve
contrastive learning, can introduce more noise in training. This is because
hard negatives are those closer to a given query, and thus more likely to be
false negatives. To address this issue, we propose a novel contrastive
confidence regularizer for Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss, a commonly
used loss for dense retrieval. Our analysis shows that the regularizer helps
dense retrieval models be more robust against false negatives with a
theoretical guarantee. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic method to
filter out noisy negative passages in the dataset, improving any downstream
dense retrieval models. Through experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate
that our method achieves better retrieval performance in comparison to existing
state-of-the-art dense retrieval systems.

<p>This work introduces the L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset, the first and largest
social media dataset specifically designed for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
in the Marathi language. The dataset comprises 18,000 manually labeled
sentences covering eight entity classes, addressing challenges posed by social
media data, including non-standard language and informal idioms. Deep learning
models, including CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and Transformer models, are evaluated on
the individual dataset with IOB and non-IOB notations. The results demonstrate
the effectiveness of these models in accurately recognizing named entities in
Marathi informal text. The L3Cube-MahaSocialNER dataset offers user-centric
information extraction and supports real-time applications, providing a
valuable resource for public opinion analysis, news, and marketing on social
media platforms. We also show that the zero-shot results of the regular NER
model are poor on the social NER test set thus highlighting the need for more

<p>In this article, I will explore the nature of interference in translation,
especially in technical and scientific texts, using a descriptivist approach. I
will have a brief overview of the historical excursion of interference in
technical and scientific translation. My aim is to explain this phenomenon and
its causes with all its paradoxes, instead of simply condemning it as an
example of supposedly bad translation. Thus, I will focus on its status in the
bibliography of translation, on the motives for and consequences of
interference in specialized translation, as well as on the nature of the
arguments given for and against this phenomenon. Therefore the relationship
between different societies has always been possible with the act of
translation. When civilizations are examined throughout history, it is seen
that the dissemination of knowledge among different societies has been achieved
by translation. These societies have often become aware of the advancements in
technology and science by means of translation. Therefore; translation becomes
very significant in technical contact between societies and humans. Since the
translation of technical texts is the preliminary scope of this thesis, it will
be beneficial to have a brief look at the history of technical translation in
the world.

<p>Large Language Models produce sequences learned as statistical patterns from
large corpora. In order not to reproduce corpus biases, after initial training
models must be aligned with human values, preferencing certain continuations
over others. Alignment, which can be viewed as the superimposition of normative
structure onto a statistical model, reveals a conflicted and complex
interrelationship between language and technology. This relationship shapes
theories of language, linguistic practice and subjectivity, which are
especially relevant to the current sophistication in artificially produced
text. We examine this practice of structuration as a two-way interaction
between users and models by analysing how ChatGPT4 redacts perceived
`anomalous' language in fragments of Joyce's Ulysses and the new linguistic
practice of prompt engineering. We then situate this alignment problem
historically, revisiting earlier postwar linguistic debates which counterposed
two views of meaning: as discrete structures, and as continuous probability
distributions. We discuss the largely occluded work of the Moscow Linguistic
School, which sought to reconcile this opposition. Our attention to the Moscow
School and later related arguments by Searle and Kristeva casts the problem of
alignment in a new light: as one involving attention to the social
structuration of linguistic practice, including structuration of anomalies
that, like the Joycean text, exist in defiance of expressive conventions. These
debates around the communicative orientation toward language can help explain
some of the contemporary behaviours and interdependencies that take place
between users and LLMs.

<p>In this short paper, we examine the main metrics used to evaluate textual
coreference and we detail some of their limitations. We show that a unique
score cannot represent the full complexity of the problem at stake, and is thus
uninformative, or even misleading. We propose a new way of evaluating
coreference, taking into account the context (in our case, the analysis of
fictions, esp. novels). More specifically, we propose to distinguish long
coreference chains (corresponding to main characters), from short ones
(corresponding to secondary characters), and singletons (isolated elements).
This way, we hope to get more interpretable and thus more informative results
through evaluation.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural
language processing and are concurrently extending the language ability to
other modalities, such as speech and vision. Nevertheless, most of the previous
work focuses on prompting LLMs with perception abilities like auditory
comprehension, and the effective approach for augmenting LLMs with speech
synthesis capabilities remains ambiguous. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive empirical exploration of boosting LLMs with the ability to
generate speech, by combining pre-trained LLM LLaMA/OPT and text-to-speech
synthesis model VALL-E. We compare three integration methods between LLMs and
speech synthesis models, including directly fine-tuned LLMs, superposed layers
of LLMs and VALL-E, and coupled LLMs and VALL-E using LLMs as a powerful text
encoder. Experimental results show that, using LoRA method to fine-tune LLMs
directly to boost the speech synthesis capability does not work well, and
superposed LLMs and VALL-E can improve the quality of generated speech both in
speaker similarity and word error rate (WER). Among these three methods,
coupled methods leveraging LLMs as the text encoder can achieve the best
performance, making it outperform original speech synthesis models with a
consistently better speaker similarity and a significant (10.9%) WER reduction.

self-supervised models can achieve performances close to the supervised model,
indicating the effectiveness of multilingual self-supervised pre-training. We
also observed that these models still have room for improvement as they kept
making similar mistakes and had unsatisfactory performances on modeling
intra-sentential code-switching. In addition, the validity of several variants
of Whisper was explored, and we concluded that they remained effective in a
code-switching scenario, and similar techniques for self-supervised models are
worth studying to boost the performance of code-switched tasks.

<p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasingly pivotal role in natural
language processing applications, their safety concerns become critical areas
of NLP research. This paper presents Safety and Over-Defensiveness Evaluation
(SODE) benchmark: a collection of diverse safe and unsafe prompts with
carefully designed evaluation methods that facilitate systematic evaluation,
comparison, and analysis over 'safety' and 'over-defensiveness.' With SODE, we
study a variety of LLM defense strategies over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs,
which reveals several interesting and important findings, such as (a) the
widely popular 'self-checking' techniques indeed improve the safety against
unsafe inputs, but this comes at the cost of extreme over-defensiveness on the
safe inputs, (b) providing a safety instruction along with in-context exemplars
(of both safe and unsafe inputs) consistently improves safety and also
mitigates undue over-defensiveness of the models, (c) providing contextual
knowledge easily breaks the safety guardrails and makes the models more
vulnerable to generating unsafe responses. Overall, our work reveals numerous
such critical findings that we believe will pave the way and facilitate further
research in improving the safety of LLMs.

<p>In this paper, we introduce a novel and simple method for obtaining
high-quality text embeddings using only synthetic data and less than 1k
training steps. Unlike existing methods that often depend on multi-stage
intermediate pre-training with billions of weakly-supervised text pairs,
followed by fine-tuning with a few labeled datasets, our method does not
require building complex training pipelines or relying on manually collected
datasets that are often constrained by task diversity and language coverage. We
leverage proprietary LLMs to generate diverse synthetic data for hundreds of
thousands of text embedding tasks across nearly 100 languages. We then
fine-tune open-source decoder-only LLMs on the synthetic data using standard
contrastive loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong
performance on highly competitive text embedding benchmarks without using any
labeled data. Furthermore, when fine-tuned with a mixture of synthetic and
labeled data, our model sets new state-of-the-art results on the BEIR and MTEB
benchmarks.

<p>Understanding and predicting the emotional trajectory in multi-party
multi-turn conversations is of great significance. Such information can be
used, for example, to generate empathetic response in human-machine interaction
or to inform models of pre-emptive toxicity detection. In this work, we
introduce the novel problem of Predicting Emotions in Conversations (PEC) for
the next turn (n+1), given combinations of textual and/or emotion input up to
turn n. We systematically approach the problem by modeling three dimensions
inherently connected to evoked emotions in dialogues, including (i) sequence
modeling, (ii) self-dependency modeling, and (iii) recency modeling. These
modeling dimensions are then incorporated into two deep neural network
architectures, a sequence model and a graph convolutional network model. The
former is designed to capture the sequence of utterances in a dialogue, while
the latter captures the sequence of utterances and the network formation of
multi-party dialogues. We perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the
various proposed models for addressing the PEC problem. The results indicate
(i) the importance of the self-dependency and recency model dimensions for the
prediction task, (ii) the quality of simpler sequence models in short
dialogues, (iii) the importance of the graph neural models in improving the
predictions in long dialogues.

<p>Answering questions using pre-trained language models (LMs) and knowledge
graphs (KGs) presents challenges in identifying relevant knowledge and
performing joint reasoning.We compared LMs (fine-tuned for the task) with the
previously published QAGNN method for the Question-answering (QA) objective and
further measured the impact of additional factual context on the QAGNN
performance. The QAGNN method employs LMs to encode QA context and estimate KG
node importance, and effectively update the question choice entity
representations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We further experimented
with enhancing the QA context encoding by incorporating relevant knowledge
facts for the question stem. The models are trained on the OpenbookQA dataset,
which contains ~6000 4-way multiple choice questions and is widely used as a
benchmark for QA tasks. Through our experimentation, we found that
incorporating knowledge facts context led to a significant improvement in
performance. In contrast, the addition of knowledge graphs to language models
resulted in only a modest increase. This suggests that the integration of
contextual knowledge facts may be more impactful for enhancing question
answering performance compared to solely adding knowledge graphs.

<p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for
alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the
integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims
to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination
prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets
that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a
corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and
tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth
comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using
RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the
individual cases and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination
intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different
LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing
hallucination detection methodologies. Furthermore, we show that using a
high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively
small LLM and achieve a competitive level of performance in hallucination
detection when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using
state-of-the-art large language models such as GPT-4.

<p>Multi-modal intent detection aims to utilize various modalities to understand
the user's intentions, which is essential for the deployment of dialogue
systems in real-world scenarios. The two core challenges for multi-modal intent
detection are (1) how to effectively align and fuse different features of
modalities and (2) the limited labeled multi-modal intent training data. In
this work, we introduce a shallow-to-deep interaction framework with data
augmentation (SDIF-DA) to address the above challenges. Firstly, SDIF-DA
leverages a shallow-to-deep interaction module to progressively and effectively
align and fuse features across text, video, and audio modalities. Secondly, we
propose a ChatGPT-based data augmentation approach to automatically augment
sufficient training data. Experimental results demonstrate that SDIF-DA can
effectively align and fuse multi-modal features by achieving state-of-the-art
performance. In addition, extensive analyses show that the introduced data
augmentation approach can successfully distill knowledge from the large
language model.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially for question answering.
However, in the face of problems beyond the scope of knowledge, these LLMs tend
to talk nonsense with a straight face, where the potential solution could be
incorporating an Information Retrieval (IR) module and generating response
based on these retrieved knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel framework
to assist LLMs, such as ChatGPT, to retrieve question-related structured
information on the knowledge graph, and demonstrate that Knowledge-based
question answering (Keqing) could be a nature Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mentor to
guide the LLM to sequentially find the answer entities of a complex question
through interpretable logical chains. Specifically, the workflow of Keqing will
execute decomposing a complex question according to predefined templates,
retrieving candidate entities on knowledge graph, reasoning answers of
sub-questions, and finally generating response with reasoning paths, which
greatly improves the reliability of LLM's response. The experimental results on
KBQA datasets show that Keqing can achieve competitive performance and
illustrate the logic of answering each question.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general
knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language
processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on
potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a
specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the
meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide
and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document
classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we
take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather
straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by
further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as
well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom
collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model
GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is
the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically,
GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica
over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens curated from
extensive data sources in the big science project Deep-time Digital Earth
(DDE), preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we
fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting
of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this
technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica,
including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training,
SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints
of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.

<p>Significant progress has been made in automatic text evaluation with the
introduction of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. However, current
sample-wise evaluation paradigm suffers from the following issues: (1)
Sensitive to prompt design; (2) Poor resistance to noise; (3) Inferior ensemble
performance with static reference. Inspired by the fact that humans treat both
criterion definition and inter sample comparison as references for evaluation,
we propose BatchEval, a paradigm that conducts batch-wise evaluation
iteratively to alleviate the above problems. We explore variants under this
paradigm and confirm the optimal settings are two stage procedure with
heterogeneous batch composition strategy and decimal scoring format.
Comprehensive experiments across 3 LLMs on 4 text evaluation tasks demonstrate
that BatchEval outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10.5% on Pearson
correlations with only 64% API cost on average. Further analyses have been
conducted to verify the robustness, generalization, and working mechanism of
BatchEval.

<p>Large language model (LLM) scaling laws are empirical formulas that estimate
changes in model quality as a result of increasing parameter count and training
data. However, these formulas, including the popular DeepMind Chinchilla
scaling laws, neglect to include the cost of inference. We modify the
Chinchilla scaling laws to calculate the optimal LLM parameter count and
pre-training data size to train and deploy a model of a given quality and
inference demand. We conduct our analysis both in terms of a compute budget and
real-world costs and find that LLM researchers expecting reasonably large
inference demand (~1B requests) should train models smaller and longer than
Chinchilla-optimal.

<p>The field of human settlement construction encompasses a range of spatial
designs and management tasks, including urban planning and landscape
architecture design. These tasks involve a plethora of instructions and
descriptions presented in natural language, which are essential for
understanding design requirements and producing effective design solutions.
Recent research has sought to integrate natural language processing (NLP) and
generative artificial intelligence (AI) into human settlement construction
tasks. Due to the efficient processing and analysis capabilities of AI with
data, significant successes have been achieved in design within this domain.
However, this task still faces several fundamental challenges. The semantic
information involved includes complex spatial details, diverse data source
formats, high sensitivity to regional culture, and demanding requirements for
innovation and rigor in work scenarios. These factors lead to limitations when
applying general generative AI in this field, further exacerbated by a lack of
high-quality data for model training. To address these challenges, this paper
first proposes HSC-GPT, a large-scale language model framework specifically
designed for tasks in human settlement construction, considering the unique
characteristics of this domain.

<p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) has received a great deal of attention in
recent years in the context of spontaneous conversations. While there have been
notable results on datasets like the well known corpus of naturalistic dyadic
conversations, IEMOCAP, for both the case of categorical and dimensional
emotions, there are few papers which try to predict both paradigms at the same
time. Therefore, in this work, we aim to highlight the performance contribution
of multi-task learning by proposing a multi-task, multi-modal system that
predicts categorical and dimensional emotions. The results emphasise the
importance of cross-regularisation between the two types of emotions. Our
approach consists of a multi-task, multi-modal architecture that uses parallel
feature refinement through self-attention for the feature of each modality. In
order to fuse the features, our model introduces a set of learnable bridge
tokens that merge the acoustic and linguistic features with the help of
cross-attention. Our experiments for categorical emotions on 10-fold validation
yield results comparable to the current state-of-the-art. In our configuration,
our multi-task approach provides better results compared to learning each
paradigm separately. On top of that, our best performing model achieves a high
result for valence compared to the previous multi-task experiments.

<p>We propose a semi-supervised text classifier based on self-training using one
positive and one negative property of neural networks. One of the weaknesses of
self-training is the semantic drift problem, where noisy pseudo-labels
accumulate over iterations and consequently the error rate soars. In order to
tackle this challenge, we reshape the role of pseudo-labels and create a
hierarchical order of information. In addition, a crucial step in self-training
is to use the classifier confidence prediction to select the best candidate
pseudo-labels. This step cannot be efficiently done by neural networks, because
it is known that their output is poorly calibrated. To overcome this challenge,
we propose a hybrid metric to replace the plain confidence measurement. Our
metric takes into account the prediction uncertainty via a subsampling
technique. We evaluate our model in a set of five standard benchmarks, and show
that it significantly outperforms a set of ten diverse baseline models.
Furthermore, we show that the improvement achieved by our model is additive to
language model pretraining, which is a widely used technique for using
unlabeled documents. Our code is available at

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly those similar to ChatGPT, have
significantly influenced the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). While
these models excel in general language tasks, their performance in
domain-specific downstream tasks such as biomedical and clinical Named Entity
Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Medical Natural Language
Inference (NLI) is still evolving. In this context, our study investigates the
potential of instruction tuning for biomedical language processing, applying
this technique to two general LLMs of substantial scale. We present a
comprehensive, instruction-based model trained on a dataset that consists of
approximately $200,000$ instruction-focused samples. This dataset represents a
carefully curated compilation of existing data, meticulously adapted and

<p>Large Lanugage Models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in a variety
of use cases, from language understanding and writing to assistance in
application development. One of the most important aspects for optimal
funcionality of LLMs is embedding layers. Word embeddings are distributed
representations of words in a continuous vector space. In the context of LLMs,
words or tokens from the input text are transformed into high-dimensional
vectors using unique algorithms specific to the model. Our research examines
the embedding algorithms from leading companies in the industry, such as
OpenAI, Google's PaLM, and BERT. Using medical data, we have analyzed
similarity scores of each embedding layer, observing differences in performance
among each algorithm. To enhance each model and provide an additional encoding
layer, we also implemented Siamese Neural Networks. After observing changes in
performance with the addition of the model, we measured the carbon footage per
epoch of training. The carbon footprint associated with large language models
(LLMs) is a significant concern, and should be taken into consideration when
selecting algorithms for a variety of use cases. Overall, our research compared
the accuracy different, leading embedding algorithms and their carbon footage,
allowing for a holistic review of each embedding algorithm.

<p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of various evaluation benchmarks. These benchmarks typically rely on a single
instruction template for evaluating all LLMs on a specific task. In this paper,
we comprehensively analyze the brittleness of results obtained via
single-prompt evaluations across 6.5M instances, involving 20 different LLMs
and 39 tasks from 3 benchmarks. To improve robustness of the analysis, we
propose to evaluate LLMs with a set of diverse prompts instead. We discuss
tailored evaluation metrics for specific use cases (e.g., LLM developers vs.
developers interested in a specific downstream task), ensuring a more reliable
and meaningful assessment of LLM capabilities. We then implement these criteria
and conduct evaluations of multiple models, providing insights into the true
strengths and limitations of current LLMs.

<p>During times of increasing antibiotic resistance and the spread of infectious
diseases like COVID-19, it is important to classify genes related to antibiotic
resistance. As natural language processing has advanced with transformer-based
language models, many language models that learn characteristics of nucleotide
sequences have also emerged. These models show good performance in classifying
various features of nucleotide sequences. When classifying nucleotide
sequences, not only the sequence itself, but also various background knowledge
is utilized. In this study, we use not only a nucleotide sequence-based
language model but also a text language model based on PubMed articles to
reflect more biological background knowledge in the model. We propose a method
to fine-tune the nucleotide sequence language model and the text language model
based on various databases of antibiotic resistance genes. We also propose an
LLM-based augmentation technique to supplement the data and an ensemble method
to effectively combine the two models. We also propose a benchmark for
evaluating the model. Our method achieved better performance than the
nucleotide sequence language model in the drug resistance class prediction.

<p>Pre-training, which utilizes extensive and varied datasets, is a critical
factor in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across numerous
applications. However, the detailed makeup of these datasets is often not
disclosed, leading to concerns about data security and potential misuse. This
is particularly relevant when copyrighted material, still under legal
protection, is used inappropriately, either intentionally or unintentionally,
infringing on the rights of the authors.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce a detailed framework designed to detect and
assess the presence of content from potentially copyrighted books within the
training datasets of LLMs. This framework also provides a confidence estimation
for the likelihood of each content sample's inclusion. To validate our
approach, we conduct a series of simulated experiments, the results of which
affirm the framework's effectiveness in identifying and addressing instances of
content misuse in LLM training processes. Furthermore, we investigate the
presence of recognizable quotes from famous literary works within these
datasets. The outcomes of our study have significant implications for ensuring
the ethical use of copyrighted materials in the development of LLMs,
highlighting the need for more transparent and responsible data management
practices in this field.

<p>The revolution of natural language processing via large language models has
motivated its use in multidisciplinary areas that include social sciences and
humanities and more specifically, comparative religion. Sentiment analysis
provides a mechanism to study the emotions expressed in text. Recently,
sentiment analysis has been used to study and compare translations of the
Bhagavad Gita, which is a fundamental and sacred Hindu text. In this study, we
use sentiment analysis for studying selected chapters of the Bible. These
chapters are known as the Sermon on the Mount. We utilize a pre-trained
language model for sentiment analysis by reviewing five translations of the
Sermon on the Mount, which include the King James version, the New
International Version, the New Revised Standard Version, the Lamsa Version, and
the Basic English Version. We provide a chapter-by-chapter and verse-by-verse
comparison using sentiment and semantic analysis and review the major
sentiments expressed. Our results highlight the varying sentiments across the
chapters and verses. We found that the vocabulary of the respective
translations is significantly different. We detected different levels of

<p>While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive
instruction-following capabilities, it is still unclear whether and to what
extent they can respond to explicit constraints that might be entailed in
various instructions. As a significant aspect of LLM alignment, it is thus
important to formulate such a specialized set of instructions as well as
investigate the resulting behavior of LLMs. To address this vacancy, we propose
a new benchmark CoDI-Eval to systematically and comprehensively evaluate LLMs'
responses to instructions with various constraints. We construct a large
collection of constraints-attributed instructions as a test suite focused on
both generalization and coverage. Specifically, we advocate an instruction
diversification process to synthesize diverse forms of constraint expression
and also deliberate the candidate task taxonomy with even finer-grained
sub-categories. Finally, we automate the entire evaluation process to
facilitate further developments. Different from existing studies on
controllable text generation, CoDI-Eval extends the scope to the prevalent
instruction-following paradigm for the first time. We provide extensive
evaluations of representative LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Vicuna) on CoDI-Eval,
revealing their limitations in following instructions with specific constraints
and there is still a significant gap between open-source and commercial
closed-source LLMs. We believe this benchmark will facilitate research into
improving the controllability of LLMs' responses to instructions. Our data and
code are available at https://github.com/Xt-cyh/CoDI-Eval.

<p>This paper describes the architecture and systems built towards solving the

Random Fields model and (b) a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned with a
customized head and compare the two approaches. The novel ideas explored are:
1) Decaying auxiliary loss (with residual) - where we train the model on an
auxiliary task of Coarse-Grained NER and include this task as a part of the
loss function 2) Triplet token blending - where we explore ways of blending the
embeddings of neighboring tokens in the final NER layer prior to prediction 3)
Task-optimal heads - where we explore a variety of custom heads and learning
rates for the final layer of the LLM. We also explore multiple LLMs including
GPT-3 and experiment with a variety of dropout and other hyperparameter
settings before arriving at our final model which achieves micro &amp; macro f1 of
0.85/0.84 (on dev) and 0.67/0.61 on the test data . We show that while
pre-trained LLMs, by themselves, bring about a large improvement in scores as
compared to traditional models, we also demonstrate that tangible improvements
to the Macro-F1 score can be made by augmenting the LLM with additional
feature/loss/model engineering techniques described above.

<p>Existing evaluations of tool learning primarily focus on validating the
alignment of selected tools for large language models (LLMs) with expected
outcomes. However, these approaches rely on a limited set of scenarios where
answers can be pre-determined, diverging from genuine needs. Furthermore, a
sole emphasis on outcomes disregards the intricate capabilities essential for
LLMs to effectively utilize tools. To tackle this issue, we propose ToolEyes, a
fine-grained system tailored for the evaluation of the LLMs' tool learning
capabilities in authentic scenarios. The system meticulously examines seven
real-world scenarios, analyzing five dimensions crucial to LLMs in tool
learning: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool
selection, and answer organization. Additionally, ToolEyes incorporates a tool
library boasting approximately 600 tools, serving as an intermediary between
LLMs and the physical world. Evaluations involving ten LLMs across three
categories reveal a preference for specific scenarios and limited cognitive
abilities in tool learning. Intriguingly, expanding the model size even
exacerbates the hindrance to tool learning. These findings offer instructive

<p>Machine translation systems have been widely adopted in our daily life,
making life easier and more convenient. Unfortunately, erroneous translations
may result in severe consequences, such as financial losses. This requires to
improve the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems.
However, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of the
complexity and intractability of the underlying neural models. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic tree
pruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems. Our key insight is that
a pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with the
original sentence. Specifically, STP (1) proposes a core semantics-preserving
pruning strategy by basic sentence structure and dependency relations on the
level of syntactic tree representation; (2) generates source sentence pairs
based on the metamorphic relation; (3) reports suspicious issues whose
translations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model. We further
evaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., Google
Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs.
The results show that STP can accurately find 5,073 unique erroneous
translations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations in
Bing Microsoft Translator (400% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with
64.5% and 65.4% precision, respectively. The reported erroneous translations
vary in types and more than 90% of them cannot be found by state-of-the-art
techniques. There are 9,393 erroneous translations unique to STP, which is
711.9% more than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, STP is quite effective
to detect translation errors for the original sentences with a recall reaching
74.0%, improving state-of-the-art techniques by 55.1% on average.

<p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial
Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such
as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation. A significant
distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to
"reason." However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge
as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks
rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes. Efforts have been
made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they
suffer from data leakage or limited scope. In this paper, we introduce
LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves
the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills
based on propositional and predicate logic. The results provide insights into
LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn
well. We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3,
ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco. The results show that test cases
from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a
rate of 25\% - 94\%. In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further
used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which
effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for
GPT-4. As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on
testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively. All the

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are foundational in various
applications due to their extensive knowledge from pre-training and
fine-tuning. Despite this, they are prone to generating factual and commonsense
errors, raising concerns in critical areas like healthcare, journalism, and
education to mislead users. Current methods for evaluating LLMs' veracity are
limited by test data leakage or the need for extensive human labor, hindering
efficient and accurate error detection. To tackle this problem, we introduce a
novel, automatic testing framework, FactChecker, aimed at uncovering factual
inaccuracies in LLMs. This framework involves three main steps: First, it
constructs a factual knowledge graph by retrieving fact triplets from a
large-scale knowledge database. Then, leveraging the knowledge graph,
FactChecker employs a rule-based approach to generates three types of questions
(Yes-No, Multiple-Choice, and WH questions) that involve single-hop and
multi-hop relations, along with correct answers. Lastly, it assesses the LLMs'
responses for accuracy using tailored matching strategies for each question
type. Our extensive tests on six prominent LLMs, including text-davinci-002,
text-davinci-003, ChatGPT~(gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4), Vicuna, and LLaMA-2, reveal
that FactChecker can trigger factual errors in up to 45\% of questions in these
models. Moreover, we demonstrate that FactChecker's test cases can improve
LLMs' factual accuracy through in-context learning and fine-tuning (e.g.,
llama-2-13b-chat's accuracy increase from 35.3\% to 68.5\%). We are making all
code, data, and results available for future research endeavors.

advancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and
Midjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their
impressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making
them susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and
biases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias
within image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including
limited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive
analysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel metamorphic testing
framework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social
bias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed
images of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these
images using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62
professions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The
framework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing
on any changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a testing
oracle that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to
neutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social
bias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. To evaluate the
effectiveness of BiasPainter, we use BiasPainter to test five widely-used
commercial image generation software and models, such as stable diffusion and
Midjourney. Experimental results show that 100\% of the generated test cases
can successfully trigger social bias in image generation models.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00779">Temporal Validity Change Prediction. (arXiv:2401.00779v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wenzel_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">Georg Wenzel</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Jatowt_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Adam Jatowt</a></p>
<p>Temporal validity is an important property of text that is useful for many
downstream applications, such as recommender systems, conversational AI, or
story understanding. Existing benchmarking tasks often require models to
identify the temporal validity duration of a single statement. However, in many
cases, additional contextual information, such as sentences in a story or posts
on a social media profile, can be collected from the available text stream.
This contextual information may greatly alter the duration for which a
statement is expected to be valid. We propose Temporal Validity Change
Prediction, a natural language processing task benchmarking the capability of
machine learning models to detect contextual statements that induce such
change. We create a dataset consisting of temporal target statements sourced
from Twitter and crowdsource sample context statements. We then benchmark a set
of transformer-based language models on our dataset. Finally, we experiment
with temporal validity duration prediction as an auxiliary task to improve the
performance of the state-of-the-art model.

<p>The high cost of full-parameter fine-tuning (FFT) of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has led to a series of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods.
However, it remains unclear which methods provide the best cost-performance
trade-off at different model scales. We introduce Astraios, a suite of 28
instruction-tuned OctoCoder models using 7 tuning methods and 4 model sizes up
to 16 billion parameters. Through investigations across 5 tasks and 8 different
datasets encompassing both code comprehension and code generation tasks, we
find that FFT generally leads to the best downstream performance across all
scales, and PEFT methods differ significantly in their efficacy based on the
model scale. LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and
performance. Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both
model robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to
demonstrate reduced robustness and less security. At last, we explore the
relationships among updated parameters, cross-entropy loss, and task
performance. We find that the tuning effectiveness observed in small models
generalizes well to larger models, and the validation loss in instruction
tuning can be a reliable indicator of overall downstream performance.

<p>With the growing use of large language models hosted on cloud platforms to
offer inference services, privacy concerns are escalating, especially
concerning sensitive data like investment plans and bank account details.
Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect
the privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of
SMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for large language models,
particularly those based on the Transformer architecture, often leads to
considerable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the
multitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are
not well-suited to SMPC and are difficult to circumvent or optimize
effectively. To address this concern, we introduce an advanced optimization
framework called SecFormer, designed to strike an optimal balance between
performance and efficiency in PPI for Transformer models. By implementing
knowledge distillation techniques, we successfully eliminate the high-cost
exponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model
performance. Additionally, we have developed a suite of efficient SMPC
protocols that utilize segmented polynomials and Goldschmidt's method to handle
other complex nonlinear functions within PPI, such as GeLU, LayerNorm, and
Softmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer outperforms MPCFormer
in performance, showing improvements of $5.6\%$ and $24.2\%$ for
BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, respectively. In terms of
efficiency, SecFormer is 3.4 and 3.2 times faster than Puma, demonstrating its

<p>Nowadays, dialogue systems are used in many fields of industry and research.
There are successful instances of these systems, such as Apple Siri, Google
Assistant, and IBM Watson. Task-oriented dialogue system is a category of
these, that are used in specific tasks. They can perform tasks such as booking
plane tickets or making restaurant reservations. Shopping is one of the most
popular areas on these systems. The bot replaces the human salesperson and
interacts with the customers by speaking. To train the models behind the scenes
of these systems, annotated data is needed. In this paper, we developed a
dataset of dialogues in the Persian language through crowd-sourcing. We
annotated these dialogues to train a model. This dataset contains nearly 22k
utterances in 15 different domains and 1061 dialogues. This is the largest
Persian dataset in this field, which is provided freely so that future
researchers can use it. Also, we proposed some baseline models for natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. These models perform two tasks for NLU:
intent classification and entity extraction. The F-1 score metric obtained for
intent classification is around 91% and for entity extraction is around 93%,

<p>The prominent large language models (LLMs) of today differ from past language
models not only in size, but also in the fact that they are trained on a
combination of natural language and formal language (code). As a medium between
humans and computers, code translates high-level goals into executable steps,
featuring standard syntax, logical consistency, abstraction, and modularity. In
this survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code
into LLMs' training data. Specifically, beyond enhancing LLMs in code
generation, we observe that these unique properties of code help (i) unlock the
reasoning ability of LLMs, enabling their applications to a range of more
complex natural language tasks; (ii) steer LLMs to produce structured and
precise intermediate steps, which can then be connected to external execution
ends through function calls; and (iii) take advantage of code compilation and
execution environment, which also provides diverse feedback for model
improvement. In addition, we trace how these profound capabilities of LLMs,
brought by code, have led to their emergence as intelligent agents (IAs) in
situations where the ability to understand instructions, decompose goals, plan
and execute actions, and refine from feedback are crucial to their success on
downstream tasks. Finally, we present several key challenges and future
directions of empowering LLMs with code.

<p>The emergence of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) has greatly
increased interest in utilizing LLMs as therapists to support individuals
struggling with mental health challenges. However, due to the lack of
systematic studies, our understanding of how LLM therapists behave, i.e., ways
in which they respond to clients, is significantly limited. Understanding their
behavior across a wide range of clients and situations is crucial to accurately
assess their capabilities and limitations in the high-risk setting of mental
health, where undesirable behaviors can lead to severe consequences. In this
paper, we propose BOLT, a novel computational framework to study the
conversational behavior of LLMs when employed as therapists. We develop an
in-context learning method to quantitatively measure the behavior of LLMs based
on 13 different psychotherapy techniques including reflections, questions,
solutions, normalizing, and psychoeducation. Subsequently, we compare the
behavior of LLM therapists against that of high- and low-quality human therapy,
and study how their behavior can be modulated to better reflect behaviors
observed in high-quality therapy. Our analysis of GPT and Llama-variants
reveals that these LLMs often resemble behaviors more commonly exhibited in
low-quality therapy rather than high-quality therapy, such as offering a higher
degree of problem-solving advice when clients share emotions, which is against
typical recommendations. At the same time, unlike low-quality therapy, LLMs
reflect significantly more upon clients' needs and strengths. Our analysis
framework suggests that despite the ability of LLMs to generate anecdotal
examples that appear similar to human therapists, LLM therapists are currently
not fully consistent with high-quality care, and thus require additional
research to ensure quality care.

the humanities. By composing sub-architectures to produce a model isomorphic to
a humanistic domain we maintain interpretability while providing function
signatures for each sub-architectural choice, allowing both traditional and
computational researchers to collaborate without disrupting established
practices. We illustrate a practical application of our approach to a
historical study of the American post-Atlantic slave trade, and make several
specific technical contributions: a novel hybrid graph-convolutional
autoencoder mechanism, batching policies for common graph topologies, and
masking techniques for particular use-cases. The effectiveness of the framework
for broadening participation of diverse domains is demonstrated by a growing
suite of two dozen studies, both collaborations with humanists and established
tasks from machine learning literature, spanning a variety of fields and data
modalities. We make performance comparisons of several different architectural
choices and conclude with an ambitious list of imminent next steps for this

<p>Bangla typing is mostly performed using English keyboard and can be highly
erroneous due to the presence of compound and similarly pronounced letters.
Spelling correction of a misspelled word requires understanding of word typing
pattern as well as the context of the word usage. A specialized BERT model
named BSpell has been proposed in this paper targeted towards word for word
correction in sentence level. BSpell contains an end-to-end trainable CNN
sub-model named SemanticNet along with specialized auxiliary loss. This allows
BSpell to specialize in highly inflected Bangla vocabulary in the presence of
spelling errors. Furthermore, a hybrid pretraining scheme has been proposed for
BSpell that combines word level and character level masking. Comparison on two
Bangla and one Hindi spelling correction dataset shows the superiority of our
proposed approach. BSpell is available as a Bangla spell checking tool via

<p>Wikipedia can be edited by anyone and thus contains various quality
sentences. Therefore, Wikipedia includes some poor-quality edits, which are
often marked up by other editors. While editors' reviews enhance the
credibility of Wikipedia, it is hard to check all edited text. Assisting in
this process is very important, but a large and comprehensive dataset for
studying it does not currently exist. Here, we propose WikiSQE, the first
large-scale dataset for sentence quality estimation in Wikipedia. Each sentence
is extracted from the entire revision history of English Wikipedia, and the
target quality labels were carefully investigated and selected. WikiSQE has
about 3.4 M sentences with 153 quality labels. In the experiment with automatic
classification using competitive machine learning models, sentences that had
problems with citation, syntax/semantics, or propositions were found to be more
difficult to detect. In addition, by performing human annotation, we found that
the model we developed performed better than the crowdsourced workers. WikiSQE

<p>We present symbol tuning - finetuning language models on in-context
input-label pairs where natural language labels (e.g., "positive/negative
sentiment") are replaced with arbitrary symbols (e.g., "foo/bar"). Symbol
tuning leverages the intuition that when a model cannot use instructions or
natural language labels to figure out a task, it must instead do so by learning
the input-label mappings.
</p>
<p>We experiment with symbol tuning across Flan-PaLM models up to 540B
parameters and observe benefits across various settings. First, symbol tuning
boosts performance on unseen in-context learning tasks and is much more robust
to underspecified prompts, such as those without instructions or without
natural language labels. Second, symbol-tuned models are much stronger at
algorithmic reasoning tasks, with up to 18.2% better performance on the List
Functions benchmark and up to 15.3% better performance on the Simple Turing
Concepts benchmark. Finally, symbol-tuned models show large improvements in
following flipped-labels presented in-context, meaning that they are more

<p>Causal inference is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. While the
field of CausalNLP has attracted much interest in the recent years, existing
causal inference datasets in NLP primarily rely on discovering causality from
empirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose the
first benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of large
language models (LLMs). Specifically, we formulate a novel task Corr2Cause,
which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causal
relationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of more
than 200K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing LLMs. Through our
experiments, we identify a key shortcoming of LLMs in terms of their causal
inference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to random
performance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try to
re-purpose LLMs for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these models
still fail to generalize -- they can only perform causal inference in
in-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used in
the queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail in
out-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. Corr2Cause
is a challenging task for LLMs, and would be helpful in guiding future research
on improving LLMs' pure reasoning skills and generalizability. Our data is at

<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Yang_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Lingyi Yang</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Jiang_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Feng Jiang</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Li_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Haizhou Li</a></p>
<p>The remarkable capabilities of large-scale language models, such as ChatGPT,
in text generation have impressed readers and spurred researchers to devise
detectors to mitigate potential risks, including misinformation, phishing, and
academic dishonesty. Despite this, most previous studies have been
predominantly geared towards creating detectors that differentiate between
purely ChatGPT-generated texts and human-authored texts. This approach,
however, fails to work on discerning texts generated through human-machine
collaboration, such as ChatGPT-polished texts. Addressing this gap, we
introduce a novel dataset termed HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts),
facilitating the construction of more robust detectors. It diverges from extant
corpora by comprising pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-polished abstracts
instead of purely ChatGPT-generated texts. Additionally, we propose the "Polish
Ratio" method, an innovative measure of the degree of modification made by
ChatGPT compared to the original human-written text. It provides a mechanism to
measure the degree of ChatGPT influence in the resulting text. Our experimental
results show our proposed model has better robustness on the HPPT dataset and
two existing datasets (HC3 and CDB). Furthermore, the "Polish Ratio" we
proposed offers a more comprehensive explanation by quantifying the degree of
ChatGPT involvement.

<p>Self-supervised and language-supervised image models contain rich knowledge
of the world that is important for generalization. Many robotic tasks, however,
require a detailed understanding of 3D geometry, which is often lacking in 2D
image features. This work bridges this 2D-to-3D gap for robotic manipulation by
leveraging distilled feature fields to combine accurate 3D geometry with rich
semantics from 2D foundation models. We present a few-shot learning method for
6-DOF grasping and placing that harnesses these strong spatial and semantic
priors to achieve in-the-wild generalization to unseen objects. Using features
distilled from a vision-language model, CLIP, we present a way to designate
novel objects for manipulation via free-text natural language, and demonstrate
its ability to generalize to unseen expressions and novel categories of
objects.

<p>Beyond the great cognitive powers showcased by language models, it is crucial
to scrutinize whether their reasoning capabilities stem from strong
generalization or merely exposure to relevant data. As opposed to constructing
increasingly complex logic, this paper probes into the boolean logic, the root
capability of a logical reasoner. We find that any pre-trained language models
even including large language models only behave like a random selector in the
face of multi-nested boolean logic, a task that humans can handle with ease. To
empower language models with this fundamental capability, this paper proposes a
new self-supervised learning method \textit{Curriculum Logical Reasoning}
(\textsc{Clr}), where we augment the training data with nested boolean logic
chain step-by-step, and program the training from simpler logical patterns
gradually to harder ones. This new training paradigm allows language models to
effectively generalize to much harder and longer-hop logic, which can hardly be
learned through naive training. Furthermore, we show that boolean logic is a
great foundation for improving the subsequent general logical tasks.

<p>The application of Machine learning to finance has become a familiar
approach, even more so in stock market forecasting. The stock market is highly
volatile, and huge amounts of data are generated every minute globally. The
extraction of effective intelligence from this data is of critical importance.
However, a collaboration of numerical stock data with qualitative text data can
be a challenging task. In this work, we accomplish this by providing an
unprecedented, publicly available dataset with technical and fundamental data
and sentiment that we gathered from news archives, TV news captions, radio
transcripts, tweets, daily financial newspapers, etc. The text data entries
used for sentiment extraction total more than 1.4 Million. The dataset consists
of daily entries from January 2018 to December 2022 for eight companies
representing diverse industrial sectors and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA) as a whole. Holistic Fundamental and Technical data is provided training
ready for Model learning and deployment. Most importantly, the data generated
could be used for incremental online learning with real-time data points
retrieved daily since no stagnant data was utilized. All the data was retired
from APIs or self-designed robust information retrieval technologies. These
adaptable technologies facilitate data extraction for any stock. Moreover, the
utilization of Spearman's rank correlation over real-time data, linking stock
returns with sentiment analysis has produced noteworthy results for the DJIA,
achieving accuracy levels surpassing 60\%. The dataset is made available at

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated mental health crises worldwide, with
social isolation and economic instability contributing to a rise in suicidal
behavior. Suicide can result from social factors such as shame, abuse,
abandonment, and mental health conditions like depression, Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorders. As these conditions develop, signs of
suicidal ideation may manifest in social media interactions. Analyzing social
media data using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can help identify
patterns of suicidal behavior, providing invaluable insights for suicide
prevention agencies, professionals, and broader community awareness
initiatives. Machine learning algorithms for this purpose require large volumes
of accurately labeled data. Previous research has not fully explored the
potential of incorporating explanations in analyzing and labeling longitudinal
social media data. In this study, we employed a model explanation method, Layer
Integrated Gradients, on top of a fine-tuned state-of-the-art language model,
to assign each token from Reddit users' posts an attribution score for
predicting suicidal ideation. By extracting and analyzing attributions of
tokens from the data, we propose a methodology for preliminary screening of
social media posts for suicidal ideation without using large language models
during inference.

<p>LLMs often face competing pressures (for example helpfulness vs.
harmlessness). To understand how models resolve such conflicts, we study
Llama-2-chat models on the forbidden fact task. Specifically, we instruct
Llama-2 to truthfully complete a factual recall statement while forbidding it
from saying the correct answer. This often makes the model give incorrect
answers. We decompose Llama-2 into 1000+ components, and rank each one with
respect to how useful it is for forbidding the correct answer. We find that in
aggregate, around 35 components are enough to reliably implement the full
suppression behavior. However, these components are fairly heterogeneous and
many operate using faulty heuristics. We discover that one of these heuristics
can be exploited via a manually designed adversarial attack which we call The
California Attack. Our results highlight some roadblocks standing in the way of
being able to successfully interpret advanced ML systems. Project website

challenges of personality consistency in personalized AI. Our method, "Machine

<p>We present time vectors, a simple tool to customize language models to new
time periods. Time vectors are created by finetuning a language model on data
from a single time (e.g., a year or month), and then subtracting the weights of
the original pretrained model. This vector specifies a direction in weight
space that, as our experiments show, improves performance on text from that
time period. Time vectors specialized to adjacent time periods appear to be
positioned closer together in a manifold. Using this structure, we interpolate
between time vectors to induce new models that perform better on intervening
and future time periods, without any additional training. We demonstrate the
consistency of our findings across different tasks, domains, model sizes, and
time scales. Our results suggest that time is encoded in the weight space of

<p>Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to provide a summary of a single
document/multi documents that can satisfy the information needs of a given
query. It is useful for various real-world applications, such as abstractive
snippet generation or more recent retrieval augmented generation (RAG). A
prototypical QFS pipeline consists of a retriever (sparse or dense retrieval)
and a generator (usually a large language model). However, applying large
language models (LLM) potentially leads to hallucinations, especially when the
evidence contradicts the prior belief of LLMs. There has been growing interest
in developing new decoding methods to improve generation quality and reduce
hallucination. In this work, we conduct a large-scale reproducibility study on
one recently proposed decoding method -- Context-aware Decoding (CAD). In
addition to replicating CAD's experiments on news summarization datasets, we
include experiments on QFS datasets, and conduct more rigorous analysis on
computational complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity. Experiments with eight
different language models show that performance-wise, CAD improves QFS quality
by (1) reducing factuality errors/hallucinations while (2) mostly retaining the
match of lexical patterns, measured by ROUGE scores, while also at a cost of
increased inference-time FLOPs and reduced decoding speed. The code
implementation based on Huggingface Library is made available

<p>Existing research has demonstrated that refining large language models (LLMs)
through the utilization of machine-generated instruction-following data
empowers these models to exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities for novel
tasks, without requiring human-authored instructions. In this paper, we
systematically investigate, preprocess, and integrate three Chinese

conversational capabilities of Mixtral-8x7B sparse Mixture-of-Experts model.
Through instruction fine-tuning on this carefully processed dataset, we
successfully construct the Mixtral-8x7B sparse Mixture-of-Experts model named
"Aurora." To assess the performance of Aurora, we utilize three widely

the effectiveness of instruction fine-tuning applied to Mixtral-8x7B sparse

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their success in language
understanding and reasoning on general topics. However, their capability to
inference based on user-specified structured data and knowledge in corpus-rare
concepts like causal decision-making is still limited. In this work, we explore
the possibility of fine-tuning an open-sourced LLM into LLM4Causal, which can
identify the causal task, execute a corresponding function, and interpret its
numerical results based on users' queries and the provided dataset. Meanwhile,
we propose a data generation process for more controllable GPT prompting and
present two instruction-tuning datasets: (1) Causal-Retrieval-Bench for causal
problem identification and input parameter extraction for causal function
calling and (2) Causal-Interpret-Bench for in-context causal interpretation.
With three case studies, we showed that LLM4Causal can deliver end-to-end
