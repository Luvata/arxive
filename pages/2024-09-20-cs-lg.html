<p><b>Authors:</b> Mercy Nyamewaa Asiedu, Iskandar Haykel, Awa Dieng, Kerrie Kauer, Tousif Ahmed, Florence Ofori, Charisma Chan, Stephen Pfohl, Negar Rostamzadeh, Katherine Heller</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantly change and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifying culturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions is not well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study to investigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases to mitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries, as well as explore opportunities where artificial intelligence could make a positive impact in health. We used a mixed methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy, and AI across 17 countries, and through an inductive approach we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded 30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participants across 5 countries in Africa and analyze responses on quantitative scales, statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level of familiarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses from surveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust, accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participants for AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, where major themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemic barriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kind qualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from an algorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the general population. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the need for further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives in decision-making around AI usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manxi Sun, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Pengzhi Gao, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Sparsely-Activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing popularity for scaling up large language models (LLMs) without exploding computational costs. Despite its success, the current design faces a challenge where all experts have the same size, limiting the ability of tokens to choose the experts with the most appropriate size for generating the next token. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Diverse Size Experts (MoDSE), a new MoE architecture with layers designed to have experts of different sizes. Our analysis of difficult token generation tasks shows that experts of various sizes achieve better predictions, and the routing path of the experts tends to be stable after a training period. However, having experts of diverse sizes can lead to uneven workload distribution. To tackle this limitation, we introduce an expert-pair allocation strategy to evenly distribute the workload across multiple GPUs. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoDSE, as it outperforms existing MoEs by allocating the parameter budget to experts adaptively while maintaining the same total parameter size and the number of experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenfeng Wu, Luping Xiang, Qiang Liu, Kun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the wake of the swift evolution of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), the global data landscape undergoes an exponential surge, propelling DNA storage into the spotlight as a prospective medium for contemporary cloud storage applications. This paper introduces a Semantic Artificial Intelligence-enhanced DNA storage (SemAI-DNA) paradigm, distinguishing itself from prevalent deep learning-based methodologies through two key modifications: 1) embedding a semantic extraction module at the encoding terminus, facilitating the meticulous encoding and storage of nuanced semantic information; 2) conceiving a forethoughtful multi-reads filtering model at the decoding terminus, leveraging the inherent multi-copy propensity of DNA molecules to bolster system fault tolerance, coupled with a strategically optimized decoder's architectural framework. Numerical results demonstrate the SemAI-DNA's efficacy, attaining 2.61 dB Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gain and 0.13 improvement in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) over conventional deep learning-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Rabin, Jim Davis, Benjamin Lewis, Matthew Scherreik</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years there has been increasing interest in the field of Open-Set Recognition, which allows a classification model to identify inputs as "unknown" when it encounters an object or class not in the training set. This ability to flag unknown inputs is of vital importance to many real world classification applications. As almost all modern training methods for neural networks use extensive amounts of regularization for generalization, it is therefore important to examine how regularization techniques impact the ability of a model to perform Open-Set Recognition. In this work, we examine the relationship between common regularization techniques and Open-Set Recognition performance. Our experiments are agnostic to the specific open-set detection algorithm and examine the effects across a wide range of datasets. We show empirically that regularization methods can provide significant improvements to Open-Set Recognition performance, and we provide new insights into the relationship between accuracy and Open-Set performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eeshaan Jain, Tushar Nandy, Gaurav Aggarwal, Ashish Tendulkar, Rishabh Iyer, Abir De</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing subset selection methods for efficient learning predominantly employ discrete combinatorial and model-specific approaches which lack generalizability. For an unseen architecture, one cannot use the subset chosen for a different model. To tackle this problem, we propose $\texttt{SubSelNet}$, a trainable subset selection framework, that generalizes across architectures. Here, we first introduce an attention-based neural gadget that leverages the graph structure of architectures and acts as a surrogate to trained deep neural networks for quick model prediction. Then, we use these predictions to build subset samplers. This naturally provides us two variants of $\texttt{SubSelNet}$. The first variant is transductive (called as Transductive-$\texttt{SubSelNet}$) which computes the subset separately for each model by solving a small optimization problem. Such an optimization is still super fast, thanks to the replacement of explicit model training by the model approximator. The second variant is inductive (called as Inductive-$\texttt{SubSelNet}$) which computes the subset using a trained subset selector, without any optimization. Our experiments show that our model outperforms several methods across several real datasets</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Arslan, Manuel Sandoval Madrigal, Mohammed Abuhamad, Deborah L. Hall, Yasin N. Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media continues to have an impact on the trajectory of humanity. However, its introduction has also weaponized keyboards, allowing the abusive language normally reserved for in-person bullying to jump onto the screen, i.e., cyberbullying. Cyberbullying poses a significant threat to adolescents globally, affecting the mental health and well-being of many. A group that is particularly at risk is the LGBTQ+ community, as researchers have uncovered a strong correlation between identifying as LGBTQ+ and suffering from greater online harassment. Therefore, it is critical to develop machine learning models that can accurately discern cyberbullying incidents as they happen to LGBTQ+ members. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of several transformer models in identifying cyberbullying targeting LGBTQ+ individuals. We seek to determine the relative merits and demerits of these existing methods in addressing complex and subtle kinds of cyberbullying by assessing their effectiveness with real social media data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasilii Feofanov, Romain Ilbert, Malik Tiomoko, Themis Palpanas, Ievgen Redko</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models, while highly effective, are often resource-intensive, requiring substantial inference time and memory. This paper addresses the challenge of making these models more accessible with limited computational resources by exploring dimensionality reduction techniques. Our goal is to enable users to run large pre-trained foundation models on standard GPUs without sacrificing performance. We investigate classical methods such as Principal Component Analysis alongside neural network-based adapters, aiming to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate time series data while preserving key features. Our experiments show up to a 10x speedup compared to the baseline model, without performance degradation, and enable up to 4.5x more datasets to fit on a single GPU, paving the way for more user-friendly and scalable foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated impressive capabilities when trained at scale, excelling at difficult cognitive tasks requiring complex reasoning and rational decision-making. In this paper, we explore the application of transformer models to chess, focusing on the critical role of the position encoding within the attention mechanism. We show that in chess, transformers endowed with a sufficiently versatile position encoding can match existing chess-playing models at a fraction of the computational cost. Our architecture significantly outperforms AlphaZero at 8x fewer FLOPS and matches prior grandmaster-level transformer-based agents at 30x fewer FLOPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Vishwanath Venkatesh, Atra Akandeh, Madhu Lokanath</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's world of advanced AI technologies, data management is a critical component of any AI/ML solution. Effective data management is vital for the creation and maintenance of high-quality, diverse datasets, which significantly enhance predictive capabilities and lead to smarter business solutions. In this work, we introduce MetaPix, a Data-centric AI platform offering comprehensive data management solutions specifically designed for unstructured data. MetaPix offers robust tools for data ingestion, processing, storage, versioning, governance, and discovery. The platform operates on four key concepts: DataSources, Datasets, Extensions and Extractors. A DataSource serves as MetaPix top level asset, representing a narrow-scoped source of data for a specific use. Datasets are MetaPix second level object, structured collections of data. Extractors are internal tools integrated into MetaPix's backend processing, facilitate data processing and enhancement. Additionally, MetaPix supports extensions, enabling integration with external third-party tools to enhance platform functionality. This paper delves into each MetaPix concept in detail, illustrating how they collectively contribute to the platform's objectives. By providing a comprehensive solution for managing and utilizing unstructured computer vision data, MetaPix equips organizations with a powerful toolset to develop AI applications effectively.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12293">Provable In-Context Learning of Linear Systems and Linear Elliptic PDEs with Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Cole, Yulong Lu, Riley O'Neill, Tianhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing, powered by the transformer architecture, exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, allowing pre-trained models to adapt to downstream tasks using few-shot prompts without updating their weights. Recently, transformer-based foundation models have also emerged as versatile tools for solving scientific problems, particularly in the realm of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the theoretical foundations of the ICL capabilities in these scientific models remain largely unexplored. This work develops a rigorous error analysis for transformer-based ICL applied to solution operators associated with a family of linear elliptic PDEs. We first demonstrate that a linear transformer, defined by a linear self-attention layer, can provably learn in-context to invert linear systems arising from the spatial discretization of PDEs. This is achieved by deriving theoretical scaling laws for the prediction risk of the proposed linear transformers in terms of spatial discretization size, the number of training tasks, and the lengths of prompts used during training and inference. These scaling laws also enable us to establish quantitative error bounds for learning PDE solutions. Furthermore, we quantify the adaptability of the pre-trained transformer on downstream PDE tasks that experience distribution shifts in both tasks (represented by PDE coefficients) and input covariates (represented by the source term). To analyze task distribution shifts, we introduce a novel concept of task diversity and characterize the transformer's prediction error in terms of the magnitude of task shift, assuming sufficient diversity in the pre-training tasks. We also establish sufficient conditions to ensure task diversity. Finally, we validate the ICL-capabilities of transformers through extensive numerical experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12295">SANE: Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration for Multiple Optima Discovery in Multi-modal and Non-differentiable Black-box Functions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpan Biswas, Rama Vasudevan, Rohit Pant, Ichiro Takeuchi, Hiroshi Funakubo, Yongtao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Both computational and experimental material discovery bring forth the challenge of exploring multidimensional and multimodal parameter spaces, such as phase diagrams of Hamiltonians with multiple interactions, composition spaces of combinatorial libraries, material structure image spaces, and molecular embedding spaces. Often these systems are black-box and time-consuming to evaluate, which resulted in strong interest towards active learning methods such as Bayesian optimization (BO). However, these systems are often noisy which make the black box function severely multi-modal and non-differentiable, where a vanilla BO can get overly focused near a single or faux optimum, deviating from the broader goal of scientific discovery. To address these limitations, here we developed Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration (SANE) to facilitate an intelligent Bayesian optimized navigation with a proposed cost-driven probabilistic acquisition function to find multiple global and local optimal regions, avoiding the tendency to becoming trapped in a single optimum. To distinguish between a true and false optimal region due to noisy experimental measurements, a human (domain) knowledge driven dynamic surrogate gate is integrated with SANE. We implemented the gate-SANE into a pre-acquired Piezoresponse spectroscopy data of a ferroelectric combinatorial library with high noise levels in specific regions, and a piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) hyperspectral data. SANE demonstrated better performance than classical BO to facilitate the exploration of multiple optimal regions and thereby prioritized learning with higher coverage of scientific values in autonomous experiments. Our work showcases the potential application of this method to real-world experiment, where such combined strategic and human intervening approaches can be critical to unlocking new discoveries in autonomous research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H M Mohaimanul Islam, Huynh Q. N. Vo, Paritosh Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic optimization problems in large-scale multi-stakeholder networked systems (e.g., power grids and supply chains) rely on data-driven scenarios to encapsulate complex spatiotemporal interdependencies. However, centralized aggregation of stakeholder data is challenging due to the existence of data silos resulting from computational and logistical bottlenecks. In this paper, we present SplitVAEs, a decentralized scenario generation framework that leverages variational autoencoders to generate high-quality scenarios without moving stakeholder data. With the help of experiments on distributed memory systems, we demonstrate the broad applicability of SplitVAEs in a variety of domain areas that are dominated by a large number of stakeholders. Our experiments indicate that SplitVAEs can learn spatial and temporal interdependencies in large-scale networks to generate scenarios that match the joint historical distribution of stakeholder data in a decentralized manner. Our experiments show that SplitVAEs deliver robust performance compared to centralized, state-of-the-art benchmark methods while significantly reducing data transmission costs, leading to a scalable, privacy-enhancing alternative to scenario generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335">Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyang Hong, Anastasis Kratsios</p>
<p>Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?"
  This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $L$-Lipschitz function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $Ld/(2n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected $L$-Lipschitz ReLU MLP of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Unlike previously known "large" classes of universal ReLU MLPs, the empirical Rademacher complexity of our class remains bounded even when its depth and width become arbitrarily large. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples.
  We achieve this by avoiding the standard approach to constructing optimal ReLU approximators, which sacrifices regularity by relying on small spikes. Instead, we introduce a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations and avoids these small spikes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Su, Anu Vellore, Amy Chang, Raffaele Mura, Blaine Nelson, Paul Kassianik, Amin Karbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in society creates new information security challenges for developers, organizations, and end-users alike. LLMs are trained on large volumes of data, and their susceptibility to reveal the exact contents of the source training datasets poses security and safety risks. Although current alignment procedures restrict common risky behaviors, they do not completely prevent LLMs from leaking data. Prior work demonstrated that LLMs may be tricked into divulging training data by using out-of-distribution queries or adversarial techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, query-based decompositional method to extract news articles from two frontier LLMs. We use instruction decomposition techniques to incrementally extract fragments of training data. Out of 3723 New York Times articles, we extract at least one verbatim sentence from 73 articles, and over 20% of verbatim sentences from 6 articles. Our analysis demonstrates that this method successfully induces the LLM to generate texts that are reliable reproductions of news articles, meaning that they likely originate from the source training dataset. This method is simple, generalizable, and does not fine-tune or change the production model. If replicable at scale, this training data extraction methodology could expose new LLM security and safety vulnerabilities, including privacy risks and unauthorized data leaks. These implications require careful consideration from model development to its end-use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haemin Park, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges related to communication efficiency and heterogeneity. To address these issues, we explore the potential of using low-rank updates. Our theoretical analysis reveals that client's loss exhibits a higher rank structure (gradients span higher rank subspace of Hessian) compared to the server's loss. Based on this insight, we hypothesize that constraining client-side optimization to a low-rank subspace could provide an implicit regularization effect. Consequently, we propose FedLoRU, a general low-rank update framework for federated learning. Our framework enforces low-rank client-side updates and accumulates these updates to form a higher-rank model. Additionally, variants of FedLoRU can adapt to environments with statistical and model heterogeneity by employing multiple or hierarchical low-rank updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedLoRU performs comparably to full-rank algorithms and exhibits robustness to heterogeneous and large numbers of clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuwen Zhao, Baojun Hu, Sizhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of global energy and environment, crude oil is an important strategic resource, and its price fluctuation has a far-reaching impact on the global economy, financial market and the process of low-carbon development. In recent years, with the gradual promotion of green energy transformation and low-carbon development in various countries, the dynamics of crude oil market have become more complicated and changeable. The price of crude oil is not only influenced by traditional factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical conflict and production technology, but also faces the challenges of energy policy transformation, carbon emission control and new energy technology development. This diversified driving factor makes the prediction of crude oil price not only very important in economic decision-making and energy planning, but also a key issue in financial markets.In this paper, the spot price data of European Brent crude oil provided by us energy information administration are selected, and a deep learning model with three layers of LSTM units is constructed to predict the crude oil price in the next few days. The results show that the LSTM model performs well in capturing the overall price trend, although there is some deviation during the period of sharp price fluctuation. The research in this paper not only verifies the applicability of LSTM model in energy market forecasting, but also provides data support for policy makers and investors when facing the uncertainty of crude oil price.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bochao Liu, Jianghu Lu, Pengju Wang, Junjie Zhang, Dan Zeng, Zhenxing Qian, Shiming Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models can achieve high inference accuracy by extracting rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, but may pose the risk of data privacy leakage in practical deployment. In this paper, we present an effective teacher-student learning approach to train privacy-preserving deep learning models via differentially private data-free distillation. The main idea is generating synthetic data to learn a student that can mimic the ability of a teacher well-trained on private data. In the approach, a generator is first pretrained in a data-free manner by incorporating the teacher as a fixed discriminator. With the generator, massive synthetic data can be generated for model training without exposing data privacy. Then, the synthetic data is fed into the teacher to generate private labels. Towards this end, we propose a label differential privacy algorithm termed selective randomized response to protect the label information. Finally, a student is trained on the synthetic data with the supervision of private labels. In this way, both data privacy and label privacy are well protected in a unified framework, leading to privacy-preserving models. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David J. Hand, Peter Christen, Sumayya Ziyad</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of identifying to which of a given set of classes objects belong is ubiquitous, occurring in many research domains and application areas, including medical diagnosis, financial decision making, online commerce, and national security. But such assignments are rarely completely perfect, and classification errors occur. This means it is necessary to compare classification methods and algorithms to decide which is ``best'' for any particular problem. However, just as there are many different classification methods, so there are many different ways of measuring their performance. It is thus vital to choose a measure of performance which matches the aims of the research or application. This paper is a contribution to the growing literature on the relative merits of different performance measures. Its particular focus is the critical importance of matching the properties of the measure to the aims for which the classification is being made.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Zhong, Di Chen, Pengqin Wang, Wenrui Wang, Shaojie Shen, Yonghong Liu, Meixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: On-road air pollution exhibits substantial variability over short distances due to emission sources, dilution, and physicochemical processes. Integrating mobile monitoring data with street view images (SVIs) holds promise for predicting local air pollution. However, algorithms, sampling strategies, and image quality introduce extra errors due to a lack of reliable references that quantify their effects. To bridge this gap, we employed 314 taxis to monitor NO, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 dynamically and sampled corresponding SVIs, aiming to develop a reliable strategy. We extracted SVI features from ~ 382,000 streetscape images, which were collected at various angles (0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, 270{\deg}) and ranges (buffers with radii of 100m, 200m, 300m, 400m, 500m). Also, three machine learning algorithms alongside the linear land-used regression (LUR) model were experimented with to explore the influences of different algorithms. Four typical image quality issues were identified and discussed. Generally, machine learning methods outperform linear LUR for estimating the four pollutants, with the ranking: random forest > XGBoost > neural network > LUR. Compared to single-angle sampling, the averaging strategy is an effective method to avoid bias of insufficient feature capture. Therefore, the optimal sampling strategy is to obtain SVIs at a 100m radius buffer and extract features using the averaging strategy. This approach achieved estimation results for each aggregation location with absolute errors almost less than 2.5 {\mu}g/m^2 or ppb. Overexposure, blur, and underexposure led to image misjudgments and incorrect identifications, causing an overestimation of road features and underestimation of human-activity features, contributing to inaccurate NO, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development outlines 17 goals to address global challenges. However, progress has been slower than expected and, consequently, there is a need to investigate the reasons behind this fact. In this study, we used a novel data-driven methodology to analyze data from 107 countries (2000$-$2022) using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Our analysis reveals strong positive and negative correlations between certain SDGs. The findings show that progress toward the SDGs is heavily influenced by geographical, cultural and socioeconomic factors, with no country on track to achieve all goals by 2030. This highlights the need for a region specific, systemic approach to sustainable development that acknowledges the complex interdependencies of the goals and the diverse capacities of nations. Our approach provides a robust framework for developing efficient and data-informed strategies, to promote cooperative and targeted initiatives for sustainable progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Blessed Deho, Michael Bewong, Selasi Kwashie, Jiuyong Li, Jixue Liu, Lin Liu, Srecko Joksimovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the last few decades, machine learning (ML) applications have grown exponentially, yielding several benefits to society. However, these benefits are tempered with concerns of discriminatory behaviours exhibited by ML models. In this regard, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a priority research area. Consequently, several fairness metrics and algorithms have been developed to mitigate against discriminatory behaviours that ML models may possess. Yet still, very little attention has been paid to the problem of naturally occurring changes in data patterns (\textit{aka} data distributional drift), and its impact on fairness algorithms and metrics. In this work, we study this problem comprehensively by analyzing 4 fairness-unaware baseline algorithms and 7 fairness-aware algorithms, carefully curated to cover the breadth of its typology, across 5 datasets including public and proprietary data, and evaluated them using 3 predictive performance and 10 fairness metrics. In doing so, we show that (1) data distributional drift is not a trivial occurrence, and in several cases can lead to serious deterioration of fairness in so-called fair models; (2) contrary to some existing literature, the size and direction of data distributional drift is not correlated to the resulting size and direction of unfairness; and (3) choice of, and training of fairness algorithms is impacted by the effect of data distributional drift which is largely ignored in the literature. Emanating from our findings, we synthesize several policy implications of data distributional drift on fairness algorithms that can be very relevant to stakeholders and practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourav Chatterjee, Timothy Sudijono</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d. data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number, and more. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d. sample of $\Theta(N^{\delta}\ln N)$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$, where $\delta\in (0,1)$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then with high probability, the MDL network fitted to this data accurately answers whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not, with test error $\leq O(N^{-\delta})$. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enze Shi, Kui Zhao, Qilong Yuan, Jiaqi Wang, Huawen Hu, Sigang Yu, Shu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a vital tool to measure and record brain activity in neuroscience and clinical applications, yet its potential is constrained by signal heterogeneity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose FoME (Foundation Model for EEG), a novel approach using adaptive temporal-lateral attention scaling to address above-mentioned challenges. FoME is pre-trained on a diverse 1.7TB dataset of scalp and intracranial EEG recordings, comprising 745M parameters trained for 1,096k steps. Our model introduces two key innovations: a time-frequency fusion embedding technique and an adaptive time-lateral attention scaling (ATLAS) mechanism. These components synergistically capture complex temporal and spectral EEG dynamics, enabling FoME to adapt to varying patterns across diverse data streams and facilitate robust multi-channel modeling. Evaluations across four downstream tasks demonstrate FoME's superior performance in classification and forecasting applications, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results. To conclude, FoME establishes a new paradigm for EEG analysis, offering a versatile foundation that advances brain-computer interfaces, clinical diagnostics, and cognitive research across neuroscience and related fields.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeng-Lin Li, Ming-Ching Chang, Wei-Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for trustworthy AI in real-world applications. Leveraging recent advances in representation learning and latent embeddings, Various scoring algorithms estimate distributions beyond the training data. However, a single embedding space falls short in characterizing in-distribution data and defending against diverse OOD conditions. This paper introduces a novel Multi-Manifold Embedding Learning (MMEL) framework, optimizing hypersphere and hyperbolic spaces jointly for enhanced OOD detection. MMEL generates representative embeddings and employs a prototype-aware scoring function to differentiate OOD samples. It operates with very few OOD samples and requires no model retraining. Experiments on six open datasets demonstrate MMEL's significant reduction in FPR while maintaining a high AUC compared to state-of-the-art distance-based OOD detection methods. We analyze the effects of learning multiple manifolds and visualize OOD score distributions across datasets. Notably, enrolling ten OOD samples without retraining achieves comparable FPR and AUC to modern outlier exposure methods using 80 million outlier samples for model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxim Fishman, Brian Chmiel, Ron Banner, Daniel Soudry</p>
<p>Abstract: We train, for the first time, large language models using FP8 precision on datasets up to 2 trillion tokens -- a 20-fold increase over previous limits. Through these extended training runs, we uncover critical instabilities in FP8 training that were not observable in earlier works with shorter durations. We trace these instabilities to outlier amplification by the SwiGLU activation function. Interestingly, we show, both analytically and empirically, that this amplification happens only over prolonged training periods, and link it to a SwiGLU weight alignment process. To address this newly identified issue, we introduce Smooth-SwiGLU, a novel modification that ensures stable FP8 training without altering function behavior. We also demonstrate, for the first time, FP8 quantization of both Adam optimizer moments. Combining these innovations, we successfully train a 7B parameter model using FP8 precision on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators, achieving on-par results with the BF16 baseline while delivering up to a $\sim 34 \%$ throughput improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel R\"oder, Frank-Michael Schleif</p>
<p>Abstract: This extended abstract explores the integration of federated learning with deep transfer hashing for distributed prediction tasks, emphasizing resource-efficient client training from evolving data streams. Federated learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model while maintaining data privacy - by incorporating deep transfer hashing, high-dimensional data can be converted into compact hash codes, reducing data transmission size and network loads. The proposed framework utilizes transfer learning, pre-training deep neural networks on a central server, and fine-tuning on clients to enhance model accuracy and adaptability. A selective hash code sharing mechanism using a privacy-preserving global memory bank further supports client fine-tuning. This approach addresses challenges in previous research by improving computational efficiency and scalability. Practical applications include Car2X event predictions, where a shared model is collectively trained to recognize traffic patterns, aiding in tasks such as traffic density assessment and accident detection. The research aims to develop a robust framework that combines federated learning, deep transfer hashing and transfer learning for efficient and secure downstream task execution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francis Ndikum Nji, Omar Faruque, Mostafa Cham, Janeja Vandana, Jianwu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifying subsets based on spatial and temporal features is crucial to the analysis of spatiotemporal data given the inherent spatial and temporal variability. Since no single clustering algorithm ensures optimal results, researchers have increasingly explored the effectiveness of ensemble approaches. Ensemble clustering has attracted much attention due to increased diversity, better generalization, and overall improved clustering performance. While ensemble clustering may yield promising results on simple datasets, it has not been fully explored on complex multivariate spatiotemporal data. For our contribution to this field, we propose a novel hybrid ensemble deep graph temporal clustering (HEDGTC) method for multivariate spatiotemporal data. HEDGTC integrates homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble methods and adopts a dual consensus approach to address noise and misclassification from traditional clustering. It further applies a graph attention autoencoder network to improve clustering performance and stability. When evaluated on three real-world multivariate spatiotemporal data, HEDGTC outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble clustering models by showing improved performance and stability with consistent results. This indicates that HEDGTC can effectively capture implicit temporal patterns in complex spatiotemporal data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyang Yu, Shengxi Li, Danilo Mandic</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models aim to learn the distribution of datasets, such as images, so as to be able to generate samples that statistically resemble real data. However, learning the underlying probability distribution can be very challenging and intractable. To this end, we introduce an approach which employs the characteristic function (CF), a probabilistic descriptor that directly corresponds to the distribution. However, unlike the probability density function (pdf), the characteristic function not only always exists, but also provides an additional degree of freedom, hence enhances flexibility in learning distributions. This removes the critical dependence on pdf-based assumptions, which limit the applicability of traditional methods. While several works have attempted to use CF in generative modeling, they often impose strong constraints on the training process. In contrast, our approach calculates the distance between query points in the CF domain, which is an unconstrained and well defined problem. Next, to deal with the sampling strategy, which is crucial to model performance, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based optimizer for the sampling process, which identifies regions where the difference between CFs is most significant. In addition, our method allows the use of a pre-trained model, such as a well-trained autoencoder, and is capable of learning directly in its feature space, without modifying its parameters. This offers a flexible and robust approach to generative modeling, not only provides broader applicability and improved performance, but also equips any latent space world with the ability to become a generative model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of AI applications, especially in large-scale wireless networks, is growing exponentially, alongside the size and complexity of the architectures used. Particularly, machine learning is acknowledged as one of today's most energy-intensive computational applications, posing a significant challenge to the environmental sustainability of next-generation intelligent systems. Achieving environmental sustainability entails ensuring that every AI algorithm is designed with sustainability in mind, integrating green considerations from the architectural phase onwards. Recently, Federated Learning (FL), with its distributed nature, presents new opportunities to address this need. Hence, it's imperative to elucidate the potential and challenges stemming from recent FL advancements and their implications for sustainability. Moreover, it's crucial to furnish researchers, stakeholders, and interested parties with a roadmap to navigate and understand existing efforts and gaps in green-aware AI algorithms. This survey primarily aims to achieve this objective by identifying and analyzing over a hundred FL works, assessing their contributions to green-aware artificial intelligence for sustainable environments, with a specific focus on IoT research. It delves into current issues in green federated learning from an energy-efficient standpoint, discussing potential challenges and future prospects for green IoT application research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aurora Spagnol, Kacper Sokol, Pietro Barbiero, Marc Langheinrich, Martin Gjoreski</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering algorithms rely on complex optimisation processes that may be difficult to comprehend, especially for individuals who lack technical expertise. While many explainable artificial intelligence techniques exist for supervised machine learning, unsupervised learning -- and clustering in particular -- has been largely neglected. To complicate matters further, the notion of a ``true'' cluster is inherently challenging to define. These facets of unsupervised learning and its explainability make it difficult to foster trust in such methods and curtail their adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a new, model-agnostic technique for explaining clustering algorithms with counterfactual statements. Our approach relies on a novel soft-scoring method that captures the spatial information utilised by clustering models. It builds upon a state-of-the-art Bayesian counterfactual generator for supervised learning to deliver high-quality explanations. We evaluate its performance on five datasets and two clustering algorithms, and demonstrate that introducing soft scores to guide counterfactual search significantly improves the results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fairness metrics are used to assess discrimination and bias in decision-making processes across various domains, including machine learning models and human decision-makers in real-world applications. This involves calculating the disparities between probabilistic outcomes among social groups, such as acceptance rates between male and female applicants. However, traditional fairness metrics do not account for the uncertainty in these processes and lack of comparability when two decision-makers exhibit the same disparity. Using Bayesian statistics, we quantify the uncertainty of the disparity to enhance discrimination assessments. We represent each decision-maker, whether a machine learning model or a human, by its disparity and the corresponding uncertainty in that disparity. We define preferences over decision-makers and utilize brute-force to choose the optimal decision-maker according to a utility function that ranks decision-makers based on these preferences. The decision-maker with the highest utility score can be interpreted as the one for whom we are most certain that it is fair.</p>

<p>Abstract: In healthcare, risk assessment of different patient outcomes has for long time been based on survival analysis, i.e.\ modeling time-to-event associations. However, conventional approaches rely on data from a single time-point, making them suboptimal for fully leveraging longitudinal patient history and capturing temporal regularities. Focusing on clinical real-world data and acknowledging its challenges, we utilize latent variable models to effectively handle irregular, noisy, and sparsely observed longitudinal data. We propose SeqRisk, a method that combines variational autoencoder (VAE) or longitudinal VAE (LVAE) with a transformer encoder and Cox proportional hazards module for risk prediction. SeqRisk captures long-range interactions, improves patient trajectory representations, enhances predictive accuracy and generalizability, as well as provides partial explainability for sample population characteristics in attempts to identify high-risk patients. We demonstrate that SeqRisk performs competitively compared to existing approaches on both simulated and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh V. Nguyen, Liang Zhao, Bobin Deng, William Severa, Honghui Xu, Shaoen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently gained significant interest in on-chip learning in embedded devices and emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, to extend SNNs to a Federated Learning (FL) setting involving collaborative model training, the communication between the local devices and the remote server remains the bottleneck, which is often restricted and costly. In this paper, we first explore the inherent robustness of SNNs under noisy communication in FL. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel Federated Learning with Top-K Sparsification (FLTS) algorithm to reduce the bandwidth usage for FL training. We discover that the proposed scheme with SNNs allows more bandwidth savings compared to ANNs without impacting the model's accuracy. Additionally, the number of parameters to be communicated can be reduced to as low as 6 percent of the size of the original model. We further improve the communication efficiency by enabling dynamic parameter compression during model training. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the baselines in terms of communication cost and model accuracy and are promising for practical network-efficient FL with SNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacobus G. M. van der Linden, Dani\"el Vos, Mathijs M. de Weerdt, Sicco Verwer, Emir Demirovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision trees are traditionally trained using greedy heuristics that locally optimize an impurity or information metric. Recently there has been a surge of interest in optimal decision tree (ODT) methods that globally optimize accuracy directly. We identify two relatively unexplored aspects of ODTs: the objective function used in training trees and tuning techniques. Additionally, the value of optimal methods is not well understood yet, as the literature provides conflicting results, with some demonstrating superior out-of-sample performance of ODTs over greedy approaches, while others show the exact opposite. In this paper, we address these three questions: what objective to optimize in ODTs; how to tune ODTs; and how do optimal and greedy methods compare? Our experimental evaluation examines 13 objective functions, including four novel objectives resulting from our analysis, seven tuning methods, and six claims from the literature on optimal and greedy methods on 165 real and synthetic data sets. Through our analysis, both conceptually and experimentally, we discover new non-concave objectives, highlight the importance of proper tuning, support and refute several claims from the literature, and provide clear recommendations for researchers and practitioners on the usage of greedy and optimal methods, and code for future comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen, Mert R. Sabuncu</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant causal prediction (ICP) is a popular technique for finding causal parents (direct causes) of a target via exploiting distribution shifts and invariance testing (Peters et al., 2016). However, since ICP needs to run an exponential number of tests and fails to identify parents when distribution shifts only affect a few variables, applying ICP to practical large scale problems is challenging. We propose MMSE-ICP and fastICP, two approaches which employ an error inequality to address the identifiability problem of ICP. The inequality states that the minimum prediction error of the predictor using causal parents is the smallest among all predictors which do not use descendants. fastICP is an efficient approximation tailored for large problems as it exploits the inequality and a heuristic to run fewer tests. MMSE-ICP and fastICP not only outperform competitive baselines in many simulations but also achieve state-of-the-art result on a large scale real data benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Pignatelli, Johan Ferret, Tim Rock\"aschel, Edward Grefenstette, Davide Paglieri, Samuel Coward, Laura Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: The temporal credit assignment problem is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL), concerned with attributing the appropriate influence to each actions in a trajectory for their ability to achieve a goal. However, when feedback is delayed and sparse, the learning signal is poor, and action evaluation becomes harder. Canonical solutions, such as reward shaping and options, require extensive domain knowledge and manual intervention, limiting their scalability and applicability. In this work, we lay the foundations for Credit Assignment with Language Models (CALM), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate credit assignment via reward shaping and options discovery. CALM uses LLMs to decompose a task into elementary subgoals and assess the achievement of these subgoals in state-action transitions. Every time an option terminates, a subgoal is achieved, and CALM provides an auxiliary reward. This additional reward signal can enhance the learning process when the task reward is sparse and delayed without the need for human-designed rewards. We provide a preliminary evaluation of CALM using a dataset of human-annotated demonstrations from MiniHack, suggesting that LLMs can be effective in assigning credit in zero-shot settings, without examples or LLM fine-tuning. Our preliminary results indicate that the knowledge of LLMs is a promising prior for credit assignment in RL, facilitating the transfer of human knowledge into value functions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12816">Hierarchical Gradient-Based Genetic Sampling for Accurate Prediction of Biological Oscillations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Rao, Yu Gu, Jason Zipeng Zhang, Ge Yu, Yang Cao, Minghan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological oscillations are periodic changes in various signaling processes crucial for the proper functioning of living organisms. These oscillations are modeled by ordinary differential equations, with coefficient variations leading to diverse periodic behaviors, typically measured by oscillatory frequencies. This paper explores sampling techniques for neural networks to model the relationship between system coefficients and oscillatory frequency. However, the scarcity of oscillations in the vast coefficient space results in many samples exhibiting non-periodic behaviors, and small coefficient changes near oscillation boundaries can significantly alter oscillatory properties. This leads to non-oscillatory bias and boundary sensitivity, making accurate predictions difficult. While existing importance and uncertainty sampling approaches partially mitigate these challenges, they either fail to resolve the sensitivity problem or result in redundant sampling. To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Gradient-based Genetic Sampling (HGGS) framework, which improves the accuracy of neural network predictions for biological oscillations. The first layer, Gradient-based Filtering, extracts sensitive oscillation boundaries and removes redundant non-oscillatory samples, creating a balanced coarse dataset. The second layer, Multigrid Genetic Sampling, utilizes residual information to refine these boundaries and explore new high-residual regions, increasing data diversity for model training. Experimental results demonstrate that HGGS outperforms seven comparative sampling methods across four biological systems, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing sampling and prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghui Yuan, Hao Chen, Renwei Luo, Feiping Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble learning has achieved remarkable success in machine learning, but its reliance on numerous base learners limits its application in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces an innovative "Margin-Maximizing Fine-Grained Ensemble Method" that achieves performance surpassing large-scale ensembles by meticulously optimizing a small number of learners and enhancing generalization capability. We propose a novel learnable confidence matrix, quantifying each classifier's confidence for each category, precisely capturing category-specific advantages of individual learners. Furthermore, we design a margin-based loss function, constructing a smooth and partially convex objective using the logsumexp technique. This approach improves optimization, eases convergence, and enables adaptive confidence allocation. Finally, we prove that the loss function is Lipschitz continuous, based on which we develop an efficient gradient optimization algorithm that simultaneously maximizes margins and dynamically adjusts learner weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional random forests using only one-tenth of the base learners and other state-of-the-art ensemble methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12878">Impact of ML Optimization Tactics on Greener Pre-Trained ML Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra Gonz\'alez \'Alvarez, Joel Casta\~no, Xavier Franch, Silverio Mart\'inez-Fern\'andez</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Given the fast-paced nature of today's technology, which has surpassed human performance in tasks like image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding, assessing the impact of Machine Learning (ML) on energy consumption is crucial. Traditionally, ML projects have prioritized accuracy over energy, creating a gap in energy consumption during model inference.
  Aims: This study aims to (i) analyze image classification datasets and pre-trained models, (ii) improve inference efficiency by comparing optimized and non-optimized models, and (iii) assess the economic impact of the optimizations.
  Method: We conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate the impact of various PyTorch optimization techniques (dynamic quantization, torch.compile, local pruning, and global pruning) to 42 Hugging Face models for image classification. The metrics examined include GPU utilization, power and energy consumption, accuracy, time, computational complexity, and economic costs. The models are repeatedly evaluated to quantify the effects of these software engineering tactics.
  Results: Dynamic quantization demonstrates significant reductions in inference time and energy consumption, making it highly suitable for large-scale systems. Additionally, torch.compile balances accuracy and energy. In contrast, local pruning shows no positive impact on performance, and global pruning's longer optimization times significantly impact costs.
  Conclusions: This study highlights the role of software engineering tactics in achieving greener ML models, offering guidelines for practitioners to make informed decisions on optimization methods that align with sustainability goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Domenic Rosati, Giles Edkins, Harsh Raj, David Atanasov, Subhabrata Majumdar, Janarthanan Rajendran, Frank Rudzicz, Hassan Sajjad</p>
<p>Abstract: While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety-aligned LLMs are known to be vulnerable to training-time attacks such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on harmful datasets. In this paper, we ask if LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial reinforcement learning. Motivated by this goal, we propose Reverse Preference Attacks (RPA), a class of attacks to make LLMs learn harmful behavior using adversarial reward during reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RPAs expose a critical safety gap of safety-aligned LLMs in RL settings: they easily explore the harmful text generation policies to optimize adversarial reward. To protect against RPAs, we explore a host of mitigation strategies. Leveraging Constrained Markov-Decision Processes, we adapt a number of mechanisms to defend against harmful fine-tuning attacks into the RL setting. Our experiments show that ``online" defenses that are based on the idea of minimizing the negative log likelihood of refusals -- with the defender having control of the loss function -- can effectively protect LLMs against RPAs. However, trying to defend model weights using ``offline" defenses that operate under the assumption that the defender has no control over the loss function are less effective in the face of RPAs. These findings show that attacks done using RL can be used to successfully undo safety alignment in open-weight LLMs and use them for malicious purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micha{\l} Wili\'nski, Mononito Goswami, Nina \.Zukowska, Willa Potosnak, Artur Dubrawski</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series foundation models promise to be powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, little is known about the concepts that these models learn and how can we manipulate them in the latent space. Our study bridges these gaps by identifying concepts learned by these models, localizing them to specific parts of the model, and steering model predictions along these conceptual directions, using synthetic time series data. Our results show that MOMENT, a state-of-the-art foundation model, can discern distinct time series patterns, and that this ability peaks in the middle layers of the network. Moreover, we show that model outputs can be steered using insights from its activations (e.g., by introducing periodic trends to initially constant signals through intervention during inference). Our findings underscore the importance of synthetic data in studying and steering time series foundation models and intervening throughout the whole model (using steering matrices), instead of a single layer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models (LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern LLMs. Existing approaches for training self-correction either require multiple models or rely on a more capable model or other forms of supervision. To this end, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's self-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we first show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline model-generated correction traces are insufficient for instilling self-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT either suffers from a distribution mismatch between the training data and the model's own responses or implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior that is often not effective at test time. SCoRe addresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of self-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer the learning process into learning a self-correction strategy that is effective at test time as opposed to simply fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt. This regularization prescribes running a first phase of RL on a base model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to collapse and then using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction during training. When applied to Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models' self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on the MATH and HumanEval benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsung-Han Wu, Hung-Ting Su, Shang-Tse Chen, Winston H. Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: The robust self-training (RST) framework has emerged as a prominent approach for semi-supervised adversarial training. To explore the possibility of tackling more complicated tasks with even lower labeling budgets, unlike prior approaches that rely on robust pretrained models, we present SNORD - a simple yet effective framework that introduces contemporary semi-supervised learning techniques into the realm of adversarial training. By enhancing pseudo labels and managing noisy training data more effectively, SNORD showcases impressive, state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets and labeling budgets, all without the need for pretrained models. Compared to full adversarial supervision, SNORD achieves a 90% relative robust accuracy under epsilon = 8/255 AutoAttack, requiring less than 0.1%, 2%, and 10% labels for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200, respectively. Additional experiments confirm the efficacy of each component and demonstrate the adaptability of integrating SNORD with existing adversarial pretraining strategies to further bolster robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aayush Karan, Kulin Shah, Sitan Chen, Yonina C. Eldar</p>
<p>Abstract: Much of Bayesian inference centers around the design of estimators for inverse problems which are optimal assuming the data comes from a known prior. But what do these optimality guarantees mean if the prior is unknown? In recent years, algorithm unrolling has emerged as deep learning's answer to this age-old question: design a neural network whose layers can in principle simulate iterations of inference algorithms and train on data generated by the unknown prior. Despite its empirical success, however, it has remained unclear whether this method can provably recover the performance of its optimal, prior-aware counterparts.
  In this work, we prove the first rigorous learning guarantees for neural networks based on unrolling approximate message passing (AMP). For compressed sensing, we prove that when trained on data drawn from a product prior, the layers of the network approximately converge to the same denoisers used in Bayes AMP. We also provide extensive numerical experiments for compressed sensing and rank-one matrix estimation demonstrating the advantages of our unrolled architecture - in addition to being able to obliviously adapt to general priors, it exhibits improvements over Bayes AMP in more general settings of low dimensions, non-Gaussian designs, and non-product priors.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12951">Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a Comparative Study with RMSNorm</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This paper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process, examining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors in the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is innately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1, 1, \cdots, 1]^T \in \mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step in LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component of a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and (iii) scale the resultant vector by $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the representation space. We also introduce the property of "irreversibility" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during the normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch normalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present possible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the choice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the original authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the hidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using RMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to the uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the component along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our findings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more computationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also learns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal to the uniform vector.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial transformer networks (STNs) were designed to enable CNNs to learn invariance to image transformations. STNs were originally proposed to transform CNN feature maps as well as input images. This enables the use of more complex features when predicting transformation parameters. However, since STNs perform a purely spatial transformation, they do not, in the general case, have the ability to align the feature maps of a transformed image and its original. We present a theoretical argument for this and investigate the practical implications, showing that this inability is coupled with decreased classification accuracy. We advocate taking advantage of more complex features in deeper layers by instead sharing parameters between the classification and the localisation network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ylva Jansson, Tony Lindeberg</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to handle large scale variations is crucial for many real world visual tasks. A straightforward approach for handling scale in a deep network is to process an image at several scales simultaneously in a set of scale channels. Scale invariance can then, in principle, be achieved by using weight sharing between the scale channels together with max or average pooling over the outputs from the scale channels. The ability of such scale channel networks to generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale ranges has, however, not previously been explored. We, therefore, present a theoretical analysis of invariance and covariance properties of scale channel networks and perform an experimental evaluation of the ability of different types of scale channel networks to generalise to previously unseen scales. We identify limitations of previous approaches and propose a new type of foveated scale channel architecture, where the scale channels process increasingly larger parts of the image with decreasing resolution. Our proposed FovMax and FovAvg networks perform almost identically over a scale range of 8, also when training on single scale training data, and do also give improvements in the small sample regime.</p>

<p>Abstract: A large number of deep learning architectures use spatial transformations of CNN feature maps or filters to better deal with variability in object appearance caused by natural image transformations. In this paper, we prove that spatial transformations of CNN feature maps cannot align the feature maps of a transformed image to match those of its original, for general affine transformations, unless the extracted features are themselves invariant. Our proof is based on elementary analysis for both the single- and multi-layer network case. The results imply that methods based on spatial transformations of CNN feature maps or filters cannot replace image alignment of the input and cannot enable invariant recognition for general affine transformations, specifically not for scaling transformations or shear transformations. For rotations and reflections, spatially transforming feature maps or filters can enable invariance but only for networks with learnt or hardcoded rotation- or reflection-invariant features</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Jeunen</p>
<p>Abstract: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for estimating treatment effects across many fields of science. Technology companies have adopted A/B-testing methods as a modern RCT counterpart, where end-users are randomly assigned various system variants and user behaviour is tracked continuously. The objective is then to estimate the causal effect that the treatment variant would have on certain metrics of interest to the business.
  When the outcomes for randomisation units -- end-users in this case -- are not statistically independent, this obfuscates identifiability of treatment effects, and harms decision-makers' observability of the system. Social networks exemplify this, as they are designed to promote inter-user interactions. This interference by design notoriously complicates measurement of, e.g., the effects of sharing. In this work, we propose a simple Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based model describing user sharing behaviour in social networks. We derive an unbiased estimator for treatment effects under this model, and demonstrate through reproducible synthetic experiments that it outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cancer drug response prediction (DRP) models present a promising approach towards precision oncology, tailoring treatments to individual patient profiles. While deep learning (DL) methods have shown great potential in this area, models that can be successfully translated into clinical practice and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment response will likely emerge from collaborative research efforts. This highlights the need for reusable and adaptable models that can be improved and tested by the wider scientific community. In this study, we present a scoring system for assessing the reusability of prediction DRP models, and apply it to 17 peer-reviewed DL-based DRP models. As part of the IMPROVE (Innovative Methodologies and New Data for Predictive Oncology Model Evaluation) project, which aims to develop methods for systematic evaluation and comparison DL models across scientific domains, we analyzed these 17 DRP models focusing on three key categories: software environment, code modularity, and data availability and preprocessing. While not the primary focus, we also attempted to reproduce key performance metrics to verify model behavior and adaptability. Our assessment of 17 DRP models reveals both strengths and shortcomings in model reusability. To promote rigorous practices and open-source sharing, we offer recommendations for developing and sharing prediction models. Following these recommendations can address many of the issues identified in this study, improving model reusability without adding significant burdens on researchers. This work offers the first comprehensive assessment of reusability and reproducibility across diverse DRP models, providing insights into current model sharing practices and promoting standards within the DRP and broader AI-enabled scientific research community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring annotator quality in training and evaluation data is a key piece of machine learning in NLP. Tasks such as sentiment analysis and offensive speech detection are intrinsically subjective, creating a challenging scenario for traditional quality assessment approaches because it is hard to distinguish disagreement due to poor work from that due to differences of opinions between sincere annotators. With the goal of increasing diverse perspectives in annotation while ensuring consistency, we propose \texttt{ARTICLE}, an in-context learning (ICL) framework to estimate annotation quality through self-consistency. We evaluate this framework on two offensive speech datasets using multiple LLMs and compare its performance with traditional methods. Our findings indicate that \texttt{ARTICLE} can be used as a robust method for identifying reliable annotators, hence improving data quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: We use the embedding formalism to construct conformal fields in $D$ dimensions, by restricting Lorentz-invariant ensembles of homogeneous neural networks in $(D+2)$ dimensions to the projective null cone. Conformal correlators may be computed using the parameter space description of the neural network. Exact four-point correlators are computed in a number of examples, and we perform a 4D conformal block decomposition that elucidates the spectrum. In some examples the analysis is facilitated by recent approaches to Feynman integrals. Generalized free CFTs are constructed using the infinite-width Gaussian process limit of the neural network, enabling a realization of the free boson.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Geethan Sannidhi, Sreeja Gangasani, Chidaksh Ravuru, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing materials with electron micrographs poses significant challenges for automated labeling due to the complex nature of nanomaterial structures. To address this, we introduce a fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that leverages recent advances in Generative AI. It is designed for analyzing and understanding the microstructures of semiconductor materials with effectiveness comparable to that of human experts, contributing to the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in nanomaterial identification. Our approach utilizes Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) such as GPT-4V, alongside text-to-image models like DALLE-3. We integrate a GPT-4 guided Visual Question Answering (VQA) method to analyze nanomaterial images, generate synthetic nanomaterial images via DALLE-3, and employ in-context learning with few-shot prompting in GPT-4V for accurate nanomaterial identification. Our method surpasses traditional techniques by enhancing the precision of nanomaterial identification and optimizing the process for high-throughput screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Jain, Chris Jermaine, Vaibhav Unhelkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for solving challenging robotic tasks, even in the presence of action and observation uncertainties. Recent LLM-based decision-making methods (also referred to as LLM-based agents), when paired with appropriate critics, have demonstrated potential in solving complex, long-horizon tasks with relatively few interactions. However, most existing LLM-based agents lack the ability to retain and learn from past interactions - an essential trait of learning-based robotic systems. We propose RAG-Modulo, a framework that enhances LLM-based agents with a memory of past interactions and incorporates critics to evaluate the agents' decisions. The memory component allows the agent to automatically retrieve and incorporate relevant past experiences as in-context examples, providing context-aware feedback for more informed decision-making. Further by updating its memory, the agent improves its performance over time, thereby exhibiting learning. Through experiments in the challenging BabyAI and AlfWorld domains, we demonstrate significant improvements in task success rates and efficiency, showing that the proposed RAG-Modulo framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Huang, Li Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the gradient flow viewpoint of the Landau equation and corresponding dynamic formulation of the Landau metric in [arXiv:2007.08591], we develop a novel implicit particle method for the Landau equation in the framework of the JKO scheme. We first reformulate the Landau metric in a computationally friendly form, and then translate it into the Lagrangian viewpoint using the flow map. A key observation is that, while the flow map evolves according to a rather complicated integral equation, the unknown component is merely a score function of the corresponding density plus an additional term in the null space of the collision kernel. This insight guides us in approximating the flow map with a neural network and simplifies the training. Additionally, the objective function is in a double summation form, making it highly suitable for stochastic methods. Consequently, we design a tailored version of stochastic gradient descent that maintains particle interactions and reduces the computational complexity. Compared to other deterministic particle methods, the proposed method enjoys exact entropy dissipation and unconditional stability, therefore making it suitable for large-scale plasma simulations over extended time periods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuxian Meng, Yongyou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are Bayesian nonparametric models for function approximation with principled predictive uncertainty estimates. Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multilayer generalizations of GPs that can represent complex marginal densities as well as complex mappings. As exact inference is either computationally prohibitive or analytically intractable in GPs and extensions thereof, some existing methods resort to variational inference (VI) techniques for tractable approximations. However, the expressivity of conventional approximate GP models critically relies on independent inducing variables that might not be informative enough for some problems. In this work we introduce amortized variational inference for DGPs, which learns an inference function that maps each observation to variational parameters. The resulting method enjoys a more expressive prior conditioned on fewer input dependent inducing variables and a flexible amortized marginal posterior that is able to model more complicated functions. We show with theoretical reasoning and experimental results that our method performs similarly or better than previous approaches at less computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Ding, Cathy Y. Li, Shawn Shan, Ben Y. Zhao, Haitao Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works show that text-to-image generative models are surprisingly vulnerable to a variety of poisoning attacks. Empirical results find that these models can be corrupted by altering associations between individual text prompts and associated visual features. Furthermore, a number of concurrent poisoning attacks can induce "model implosion," where the model becomes unable to produce meaningful images for unpoisoned prompts. These intriguing findings highlight the absence of an intuitive framework to understand poisoning attacks on these models. In this work, we establish the first analytical framework on robustness of image generative models to poisoning attacks, by modeling and analyzing the behavior of the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models. We model cross-attention training as an abstract problem of "supervised graph alignment" and formally quantify the impact of training data by the hardness of alignment, measured by an Alignment Difficulty (AD) metric. The higher the AD, the harder the alignment. We prove that AD increases with the number of individual prompts (or concepts) poisoned. As AD grows, the alignment task becomes increasingly difficult, yielding highly distorted outcomes that frequently map meaningful text prompts to undefined or meaningless visual representations. As a result, the generative model implodes and outputs random, incoherent images at large. We validate our analytical framework through extensive experiments, and we confirm and explain the unexpected (and unexplained) effect of model implosion while producing new, unforeseen insights. Our work provides a useful tool for studying poisoning attacks against diffusion models and their defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amine Sadikine, Bogdan Badic, Jean-Pierre Tasu, Vincent Noblet, Pascal Ballet, Dimitris Visvikis, Pierre-Henri Conze</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting hepatic vessels from abdominal images is of high interest for clinicians since it allows to divide the liver into functionally-independent Couinaud segments. In this respect, an automated liver blood vessel extraction is widely summoned. Despite the significant growth in performance of semantic segmentation methodologies, preserving the complex multi-scale geometry of main vessels and ramifications remains a major challenge. This paper provides a new deep supervised approach for vessel segmentation, with a strong focus on representations arising from the different scales inherent to the vascular tree geometry. In particular, we propose a new clustering technique to decompose the tree into various scale levels, from tiny to large vessels. Then, we extend standard 3D UNet to multi-task learning by incorporating scale-specific auxiliary tasks and contrastive learning to encourage the discrimination between scales in the shared representation. Promising results, depicted in several evaluation metrics, are revealed on the public 3D-IRCADb dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amine Sadikine, Bogdan Badic, Enzo Ferrante, Vincent Noblet, Pascal Ballet, Dimitris Visvikis, Pierre-Henri Conze</p>
<p>Abstract: The precise delineation of blood vessels in medical images is critical for many clinical applications, including pathology detection and surgical planning. However, fully-automated vascular segmentation is challenging because of the variability in shape, size, and topology. Manual segmentation remains the gold standard but is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for large-scale studies. Hence, there is a need for automatic and reliable segmentation methods that can accurately detect blood vessels from medical images. The integration of shape and topological priors into vessel segmentation models has been shown to improve segmentation accuracy by offering contextual information about the shape of the blood vessels and their spatial relationships within the vascular tree. To further improve anatomical consistency, we propose a new joint prior encoding mechanism which incorporates both shape and topology in a single latent space. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the publicly available 3D-IRCADb dataset. More globally, the proposed approach holds promise in overcoming the challenges associated with automatic vessel delineation and has the potential to advance the field of deep priors encoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Shiming Ge, Daichi Zhang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world applications today like video surveillance and urban governance need to address the recognition of masked faces, where content replacement by diverse masks often brings in incomplete appearance and ambiguous representation, leading to a sharp drop in accuracy. Inspired by recent progress on amodal perception, we propose to migrate the mechanism of amodal completion for the task of masked face recognition with an end-to-end de-occlusion distillation framework, which consists of two modules. The \textit{de-occlusion} module applies a generative adversarial network to perform face completion, which recovers the content under the mask and eliminates appearance ambiguity. The \textit{distillation} module takes a pre-trained general face recognition model as the teacher and transfers its knowledge to train a student for completed faces using massive online synthesized face pairs. Especially, the teacher knowledge is represented with structural relations among instances in multiple orders, which serves as a posterior regularization to enable the adaptation. In this way, the knowledge can be fully distilled and transferred to identify masked faces. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the well-known coded caching problem in an online learning framework, wherein requests arrive sequentially, and an online policy can update the cache contents based on the history of requests seen thus far. We introduce a caching policy based on the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader principle and show that for any time horizon T and any request sequence, it achieves a sub-linear regret of \mathcal{O}(\sqrt(T) ) with respect to an oracle that knows the request sequence beforehand. Our study marks the first examination of adversarial regret in the coded caching setup. Furthermore, we also address the issue of switching cost by establishing an upper bound on the expected number of cache updates made by our algorithm under unrestricted switching and also provide an upper bound on the regret under restricted switching when cache updates can only happen in a pre-specified subset of timeslots. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights with numerical results using a real-world dataset</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linying Zhang, Stefano Pagani, Jun Zhang, Francesco Regazzoni</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a non-intrusive method to build surrogate models that approximate the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), capable of taking into account the dependence of the solution on the shape of the computational domain. Our approach is based on the combination of two neural networks (NNs). The first NN, conditioned on a latent code, provides an implicit representation of geometry variability through signed distance functions. This automated shape encoding technique generates compact, low-dimensional representations of geometries within a latent space, without requiring the explicit construction of an encoder. The second NN reconstructs the output physical fields independently for each spatial point, thus avoiding the computational burden typically associated with high-dimensional discretizations like computational meshes. Furthermore, we show that accuracy in geometrical characterization can be further enhanced by employing Fourier feature mapping as input feature of the NN. The meshless nature of the proposed method, combined with the dimensionality reduction achieved through automatic feature extraction in latent space, makes it highly flexible and computationally efficient. This strategy eliminates the need for manual intervention in extracting geometric parameters, and can even be applied in cases where geometries undergo changes in their topology. Numerical tests in the field of fluid dynamics and solid mechanics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately predict the solution of PDEs in domains of arbitrary shape. Remarkably, the results show that it achieves accuracy comparable to the best-case scenarios where an explicit parametrization of the computational domain is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, High Definition (HD) maps provide a complete lane model that is not limited by sensor range and occlusions. However, the generation and upkeep of HD maps involves periodic data collection and human annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we investigate automating the lane model generation and the use of sparse vehicle observations instead of dense sensor measurements. For our approach, a pre-processing step generates polylines by aligning and aggregating observed lane boundaries. Aligned driven traces are used as starting points for predicting lane pairs defined by the left and right boundary points. We propose Lane Model Transformer Network (LMT-Net), an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that performs polyline encoding and predicts lane pairs and their connectivity. A lane graph is formed by using predicted lane pairs as nodes and predicted lane connectivity as edges. We evaluate the performance of LMT-Net on an internal dataset that consists of multiple vehicle observations as well as human annotations as Ground Truth (GT). The evaluation shows promising results and demonstrates superior performance compared to the implemented baseline on both highway and non-highway Operational Design Domain (ODD).</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance through supervised fine-tuning or in-context learning using gold labels. However, this paradigm is limited by the availability of gold labels, while in certain scenarios, LLMs may need to perform tasks that are too complex for humans to provide such labels. To tackle this challenge, this study explores whether solely utilizing unlabeled data can elicit strong model capabilities. We propose a new paradigm termed zero-to-strong generalization. We iteratively prompt LLMs to annotate unlabeled data and retain high-quality labels by filtering. Surprisingly, we obverse that this iterative process gradually unlocks LLMs' potential on downstream tasks. Our experiments on extensive classification and reasoning tasks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our analysis indicates that this paradigm is effective for both in-context learning and fine-tuning, and for various model sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated experiments in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) require rapid image segmentation to optimize data representation for human interpretation, decision-making, site-selective spectroscopies, and atomic manipulation. Currently, segmentation tasks are typically performed using supervised machine learning methods, which require human-labeled data and are sensitive to out-of-distribution drift effects caused by changes in resolution, sampling, or beam shape. Here, we operationalize and benchmark a recently proposed reward-driven optimization workflow for on-the fly image analysis in STEM. This unsupervised approach is much more robust, as it does not rely on human labels and is fully explainable. The explanatory feedback can help the human to verify the decision making and potentially tune the model by selecting the position along the Pareto frontier of reward functions. We establish the timing and effectiveness of this method, demonstrating its capability for real-time performance in high-throughput and dynamic automated STEM experiments. The reward driven approach allows to construct explainable robust analysis workflows and can be generalized to a broad range of image analysis tasks in electron and scanning probe microscopy and chemical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is critical for assisting surgeons in understanding surgical videos. Existing studies focused more on online surgical phase recognition, by leveraging preceding frames to predict the current frame. Despite great progress, they formulated the task as a series of frame-wise classification, which resulted in a lack of global context of the entire procedure and incoherent predictions. Moreover, besides online analysis, accurate offline surgical phase recognition is also in significant clinical need for retrospective analysis, and existing online algorithms do not fully analyze the entire video, thereby limiting accuracy in offline analysis. To overcome these challenges and enhance both online and offline inference capabilities, we propose a universal Surgical Phase Localization Network, named SurgPLAN++, with the principle of temporal detection. To ensure a global understanding of the surgical procedure, we devise a phase localization strategy for SurgPLAN++ to predict phase segments across the entire video through phase proposals. For online analysis, to generate high-quality phase proposals, SurgPLAN++ incorporates a data augmentation strategy to extend the streaming video into a pseudo-complete video through mirroring, center-duplication, and down-sampling. For offline analysis, SurgPLAN++ capitalizes on its global phase prediction framework to continuously refine preceding predictions during each online inference step, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of phase recognition. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, and our SurgPLAN++ achieves remarkable performance in both online and offline modes, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwon Jung, Qin Liu, Tenghao Huang, Ben Zhou, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieval from external sources. However, it often struggles to filter out inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream task, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familiarity-aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Specifically, FaviComp proactively lowers the perplexity of the compressed evidence with regard to the target model by combining token probabilities from both the compression model and the target model to generate context that is more familiar to the target model. This approach balances the integration of parametric and non-parametric knowledge, which is especially helpful in complex tasks where the retrieved evidence set may not contain all the necessary information. Experimental results demonstrate that FaviComp consistently outperforms existing baselines in multiple open-domain QA datasets, achieving high compression rates and showcasing the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Lv, Yuan Feng, Xike Xie, Xin Jia, Qirong Peng, Guiming Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved notable success across various domains, yet efficient inference is still limited by the quadratic computation complexity of the attention mechanism. The inference consists of prefilling and decoding phases. Although several attempts have been made to accelerate decoding, the inefficiency of the prefilling phase, especially for long-context tasks, remains a challenge. In this paper, we observe a locality in query criticality during the prefilling phase of long-context processing: adjacent query tokens tend to focus on similar subsets of the past Key-Value (KV) cache. Based on this observation, we propose CritiPrefill, a criticality-based segment-wise prefilling method. This method partitions the input sequence's queries and KV cache into segments and blocks, utilizing a segment-wise algorithm to estimate the query criticality. By pruning non-critical computations between query segments and cache blocks in the self-attention mechanism, the prefilling process can be significantly accelerated. Extensive evaluations on multiple long-context datasets show up to 2.7x speedup on Llama3-8B and 3.0x speedup on Yi-9B for 128K context length on a single A100 GPU, with minimal quality degradation.</p>

More precisely, TTA averages the predictions of multiple data augmentations of an instance to produce a final prediction. Although the effectiveness of TTA has been empirically reported, it can be expected that the predictive performance achieved will depend on the set of data augmentation methods used during testing. In particular, the data augmentation methods applied should make different contributions to performance. That is, it is anticipated that there may be differing degrees of contribution in the set of data augmentation methods used for TTA, and these could have a negative impact on prediction performance. In this study, we consider a weighted version of the TTA based on the contribution of each data augmentation. Some variants of TTA can be regarded as considering the problem of determining the appropriate weighting. We demonstrate that the determination of the coefficients of this weighted TTA can be formalized in a variational Bayesian framework. We also show that optimizing the weights to maximize the marginal log-likelihood suppresses candidates of unwanted data augmentations at the test phase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Leigh, Samuel Klein, Fran\c{c}ois Charton, Tobias Golling, Lukas Heinrich, Michael Kagan, In\^es Ochoa, Margarita Osadchy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we significantly enhance masked particle modeling (MPM), a self-supervised learning scheme for constructing highly expressive representations of unordered sets relevant to developing foundation models for high-energy physics. In MPM, a model is trained to recover the missing elements of a set, a learning objective that requires no labels and can be applied directly to experimental data. We achieve significant performance improvements over previous work on MPM by addressing inefficiencies in the implementation and incorporating a more powerful decoder. We compare several pre-training tasks and introduce new reconstruction methods that utilize conditional generative models without data tokenization or discretization. We show that these new methods outperform the tokenized learning objective from the original MPM on a new test bed for foundation models for jets, which includes using a wide variety of downstream tasks relevant to jet physics, such as classification, secondary vertex finding, and track identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santosh Kumar Radha, Yasamin Nouri Jelyani, Ara Ghukasyan, Oktay Goktas</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative human engagement is a common and effective means of leveraging the advanced language processing power of large language models (LLMs). Using well-structured prompts in a conversational manner, human users can effectively influence an LLM to develop more thoughtful and accurate responses. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework for enhancing LLM responses by generating "thought"-provoking prompts vis a vis an input query and the current iteration of an LLM's response. Unlike static or semi-static approaches, e.g. Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), IoT adapts its reasoning path dynamically, based on evolving context, and without generating alternate explorative thoughts which are ultimately discarded. The three components of the IoT framework are (1) an Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA) responsible for generating instructive, context-specific prompts; (2) an LLM Agent (LLMA) that processes these prompts to refine its responses; and (3) an iterative prompting loop that implements a conversation between the former two components. We introduce two variants of our framework: Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT), where an LLM decides when to stop iterating, and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), which always forces a fixed number iterations. We investigate the performance of IoT across various datasets, spanning complex reasoning tasks from the GPQA dataset, explorative problem-solving in Game of 24, puzzle solving in Mini Crosswords, and multi-hop question answering from the HotpotQA dataset. Our results show that IoT represents a viable paradigm for autonomous response refinement in LLMs, showcasing significant improvements over CoT and thereby enabling more adaptive and efficient reasoning systems that minimize human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Ito</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing heteroscedastic Gaussian processes (HGPs) that identify unknown systems in a data-driven manner. Although HGPs effectively address the heteroscedasticity of noise in complex training datasets, calculating the exact posterior distributions of the HGPs is challenging, as these distributions are no longer multivariate normal. This study derives the exact means, variances, and cumulative distributions of the posterior distributions. Furthermore, the derived theoretical findings are applied to a chance-constrained tracking controller. After an HGP identifies an unknown disturbance in a plant system, the controller can handle chance constraints regarding the system despite the presence of the disturbance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image inpainting is a valuable technique for enhancing images that have been corrupted. The primary challenge in this research revolves around the extent of corruption in the input image that the deep learning model must restore. To address this challenge, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for learning and replicating the missing pixels. Additionally, we have developed a distinct variant of the Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN), which we refer to as the Semi-SRGAN (SSRGAN). Furthermore, we leveraged three diverse datasets to assess the robustness and accuracy of our proposed model. Our training process involves varying levels of pixel corruption to attain optimal accuracy and generate high-quality images.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Michelangelo: a minimal, synthetic, and unleaked long-context reasoning evaluation for large language models which is also easy to automatically score. This evaluation is derived via a novel, unifying framework for evaluations over arbitrarily long contexts which measure the model's ability to do more than retrieve a single piece of information from its context. The central idea of the \frameworkname framework (\frameworkshort) is to construct tasks which require a model to ``chisel away'' the irrelevant information in the context, revealing a latent structure in the context. To verify a model's understanding of this latent structure, we query the model for details of the structure. Using \frameworkshort, we produce three diagnostic long-context evaluations across code and natural-language domains intended to provide a stronger signal of long-context language model capabilities. We perform evaluations on several state-of-the-art models and demonstrate both that a) the proposed evaluations are high-signal and b) that there is significant room for improvement in synthesizing long-context information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Nazzal, Issa Khalil, Abdallah Khreishah, NhatHai Phan</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability of generating high-quality source code using large language models (LLMs) reduces software development time and costs. However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas M. Dibot, Julien P. Renoult, William Puech</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI has seen major developments in recent years, enhancing the realism of synthetic images, also known as computer-generated images. In addition, generative AI has also made it possible to modify specific image characteristics through image editing. Previous work has developed methods based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating realistic images, in particular faces, but also to modify specific features. However, this work has never been applied to specific animal species. Moreover, the assessment of the results has been generally done subjectively, rather than quantitatively. In this paper, we propose an approach based on methods for generating images of faces of male or female mandrills, a non-human primate. The main novelty of proposed method is the ability to edit their sex by identifying a sex axis in the latent space of a specific GAN. In addition, we have developed an assessment of the sex levels based on statistical features extracted from real image distributions. The experimental results we obtained from a specific database are not only realistic, but also accurate, meeting a need for future work in behavioral experiments with wild mandrills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjia Yang, Jiazhe Li, Yufei Zhang, Haixin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluidic injection provides a promising solution to improve the performance of overexpanded single expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) during vehicle acceleration. However, determining the injection parameters for the best overall performance under multiple nozzle operating conditions is still a challenge. The gradient-based optimization method requires gradients of injection parameters at each design point, leading to high computational costs if traditional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are adopted. This paper uses a pretrained neural network model to replace CFD during optimization to quickly calculate the nozzle flow field at multiple design points. Considering the physical characteristics of the nozzle flow field, a prior-based prediction strategy is adopted to enhance the model's transferability. In addition, the back-propagation algorithm of the neural network is adopted to quickly evaluate the gradients by calling the computation process only once, thereby greatly reducing the gradient computation time compared to the finite differential method. As a test case, the average nozzle thrust coefficient of a SERN at seven design points is optimized. An improvement in the thrust coefficient of 1.14% is achieved, and the time cost is greatly reduced compared with the traditional optimization methods, even when the time to establish the database for training is considered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjia Yang, Runze Li, Yufei Zhang, Lu Lu, Haixin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based models provide a promising way to rapidly acquire transonic swept wing flow fields but suffer from large computational costs in establishing training datasets. Here, we propose a physics-embedded transfer learning framework to efficiently train the model by leveraging the idea that a three-dimensional flow field around wings can be analyzed with two-dimensional flow fields around cross-sectional airfoils. An airfoil aerodynamics prediction model is pretrained with airfoil samples. Then, an airfoil-to-wing transfer model is fine-tuned with a few wing samples to predict three-dimensional flow fields based on two-dimensional results on each spanwise cross section. Sweep theory is embedded when determining the corresponding airfoil geometry and operating conditions, and to obtain the sectional airfoil lift coefficient, which is one of the operating conditions, the low-fidelity vortex lattice method and data-driven methods are proposed and evaluated. Compared to a nontransfer model, introducing the pretrained model reduces the error by 30%, while introducing sweep theory further reduces the error by 9%. When reducing the dataset size, less than half of the wing training samples are need to reach the same error level as the nontransfer framework, which makes establishing the model much easier.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlei Huang, Zhiqi Ma, Dian Meng, Yanran Liu, Shiwei Ruan, Qingqiang Sun, Xubin Zheng, Ziyue Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of synthetic speech as data augmentation is gaining increasing popularity in fields such as automatic speech recognition and speech classification tasks. Despite novel text-to-speech systems with voice cloning capabilities, that allow the usage of a larger amount of voices based on short audio segments, it is known that these systems tend to hallucinate and oftentimes produce bad data that will most likely have a negative impact on the downstream task. In the present work, we conduct a set of experiments around zero-shot learning with synthetic speech data for the specific task of speech commands classification. Our results on the Google Speech Commands dataset show that a simple ASR-based filtering method can have a big impact in the quality of the generated data, translating to a better performance. Furthermore, despite the good quality of the generated speech data, we also show that synthetic and real speech can still be easily distinguishable when using self-supervised (WavLM) features, an aspect further explored with a CycleGAN to bridge the gap between the two types of speech material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Xie, Zhuo Yang, Chun-Chun Hu, Haw-Ching Yang, Yan Lu, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Powder bed fusion (PBF) is an emerging metal additive manufacturing (AM) technology that enables rapid fabrication of complex geometries. However, defects such as pores and balling may occur and lead to structural unconformities, thus compromising the mechanical performance of the part. This has become a critical challenge for quality assurance as the nature of some defects is stochastic during the process and invisible from the exterior. To address this issue, digital twin (DT) using machine learning (ML)-based modeling can be deployed for AM process monitoring and control. Melt pool is one of the most commonly observed physical phenomena for process monitoring, usually by high-speed cameras. Once labeled and preprocessed, the melt pool images are used to train ML-based models for DT applications such as process anomaly detection and print quality evaluation. Nonetheless, the reusability of DTs is restricted due to the wide variability of AM settings, including AM machines and monitoring instruments. The performance of the ML models trained using the dataset collected from one setting is usually compromised when applied to other settings. This paper proposes a knowledge transfer pipeline between different AM settings to enhance the reusability of AM DTs. The source and target datasets are collected from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Cheng Kung University with different cameras, materials, AM machines, and process parameters. The proposed pipeline consists of four steps: data preprocessing, data augmentation, domain alignment, and decision alignment. Compared with the model trained only using the source dataset, this pipeline increased the melt pool anomaly detection accuracy by 31% without any labeled training data from the target dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Franz Thaler, Darko Stern, Gernot Plank, Martin Urschler</p>
<p>Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases and consequently, a major cause for mortality and morbidity worldwide. Accurate assessment of myocardial tissue viability for post-MI patients is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, e.g. allowing surgical revascularization, or to determine the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in the future. Fine-grained analysis of the myocardium and its surrounding anatomical structures can be performed by combining the information obtained from complementary medical imaging techniques. In this work, we use late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance (MR), T2-weighted (T2) MR and balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine MR in order to semantically segment the left and right ventricle, healthy and scarred myocardial tissue, as well as edema. To this end, we propose the Multi-Sequence Cascading Refinement CNN (MS-CaRe-CNN), a 2-stage CNN cascade that receives multi-sequence data and generates predictions of the anatomical structures of interest without considering tissue viability at Stage 1. The prediction of Stage 1 is then further refined in Stage 2, where the model additionally distinguishes myocardial tissue based on viability, i.e. healthy, scarred and edema regions. Our proposed method is set up as a 5-fold ensemble and semantically segments scar tissue achieving 62.31% DSC and 82.65% precision, as well as 63.78% DSC and 87.69% precision for the combined scar and edema region. These promising results for such small and challenging structures confirm that MS-CaRe-CNN is well-suited to generate semantic segmentations to assess the viability of myocardial tissue, enabling downstream tasks like personalized therapy planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper illustrates the central role of loss functions in data-driven decision making, providing a comprehensive survey on their influence in cost-sensitive classification (CSC) and reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate how different regression loss functions affect the sample efficiency and adaptivity of value-based decision making algorithms. Across multiple settings, we prove that algorithms using the binary cross-entropy loss achieve first-order bounds scaling with the optimal policy's cost and are much more efficient than the commonly used squared loss. Moreover, we prove that distributional algorithms using the maximum likelihood loss achieve second-order bounds scaling with the policy variance and are even sharper than first-order bounds. This in particular proves the benefits of distributional RL. We hope that this paper serves as a guide analyzing decision making algorithms with varying loss functions, and can inspire the reader to seek out better loss functions to improve any decision making algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a new data representation method based on Quantum Cognition Machine Learning and apply it to manifold learning, specifically to the estimation of intrinsic dimension of data sets. The idea is to learn a representation of each data point as a quantum state, encoding both local properties of the point as well as its relation with the entire data. Inspired by ideas from quantum geometry, we then construct from the quantum states a point cloud equipped with a quantum metric. The metric exhibits a spectral gap whose location corresponds to the intrinsic dimension of the data. The proposed estimator is based on the detection of this spectral gap. When tested on synthetic manifold benchmarks, our estimates are shown to be robust with respect to the introduction of point-wise Gaussian noise. This is in contrast to current state-of-the-art estimators, which tend to attribute artificial ``shadow dimensions'' to noise artifacts, leading to overestimates. This is a significant advantage when dealing with real data sets, which are inevitably affected by unknown levels of noise. We show the applicability and robustness of our method on real data, by testing it on the ISOMAP face database, MNIST, and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. We experimentally demonstrate this new approach, reaching an improvement in the relevant figure of merit by a factor of up to 5. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Volker Tresp, Hang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The tensor brain has been introduced as a computational model for perception and memory. We provide an overview of the tensor brain model, including recent developments. The tensor brain has two major layers: the representation layer and the index layer. The representation layer is a model for the subsymbolic global workspace from consciousness research. The state of the representation layer is the cognitive brain state. The index layer contains symbols for concepts, time instances, and predicates. In a bottom-up operation, the cognitive brain state is encoded by the index layer as symbolic labels. In a top-down operation, symbols are decoded and written to the representation layer. This feeds to earlier processing layers as embodiment. The top-down operation became the basis for semantic memory. The embedding vector of a concept forms the connection weights between its index and the representation layer. The embedding is the signature or ``DNA'' of a concept, which is decoded by the brain when its index is activated. It integrates all that is known about a concept from different experiences, modalities, and symbolic decodings. Although being computational, it has been suggested that the tensor brain might be related to the actual operation of the brain. The sequential nature of symbol generation might have been a prerequisite to the generation of natural language. We describe an attention mechanism and discuss multitasking by multiplexing. We emphasize the inherent multimodality of the tensor brain. Finally, we discuss embedded and symbolic reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema are significant complications of diabetes that can lead to vision loss. Early detection through ultra-widefield fundus imaging enhances patient outcomes but presents challenges in image quality and analysis scale. This paper introduces deep learning solutions for automated UWF image analysis within the framework of the MICCAI 2024 UWF4DR challenge. We detail methods and results across three tasks: image quality assessment, detection of referable DR, and identification of DME. Employing advanced convolutional neural network architectures such as EfficientNet and ResNet, along with preprocessing and augmentation strategies, our models demonstrate robust performance in these tasks. Results indicate that deep learning can significantly aid in the automated analysis of UWF images, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of DR and DME detection in clinical settings.</p>

Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capacity to perform machine translation tasks, and it can also enhance and translate product titles cross-lingually in one step. However, product title translation often requires more than just language conversion because titles are short, lack context, and contain specialized terminology. This study proposes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that leverages existing bilingual product information in e-commerce by retrieving similar bilingual examples and incorporating them as few-shot prompts to enhance LLM-based product title translation. Experiment results show that our proposed RAG approach improve product title translation quality with chrF score gains of up to 15.3% for language pairs where the LLM has limited proficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Hairi, Minghong Fang, Zifan Zhang, Alvaro Velasquez, Jia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study a fully-decentralized multi-agent policy evaluation problem, which is an important sub-problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, in the presence of up to $f$ faulty agents. In particular, we focus on the so-called Byzantine faulty model with model poisoning setting. In general, policy evaluation is to evaluate the value function of any given policy. In cooperative multi-agent system, the system-wide rewards are usually modeled as the uniform average of rewards from all agents. We investigate the multi-agent policy evaluation problem in the presence of Byzantine agents, particularly in the setting of heterogeneous local rewards. Ideally, the goal of the agents is to evaluate the accumulated system-wide rewards, which are uniform average of rewards of the normal agents for a given policy. It means that all agents agree upon common values (the consensus part) and furthermore, the consensus values are the value functions (the convergence part). However, we prove that this goal is not achievable. Instead, we consider a relaxed version of the problem, where the goal of the agents is to evaluate accumulated system-wide reward, which is an appropriately weighted average reward of the normal agents. We further prove that there is no correct algorithm that can guarantee that the total number of positive weights exceeds $|\mathcal{N}|-f $, where $|\mathcal{N}|$ is the number of normal agents. Towards the end, we propose a Byzantine-tolerant decentralized temporal difference algorithm that can guarantee asymptotic consensus under scalar function approximation. We then empirically test the effective of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Taus, Vrushabh Zinage, Takashi Tanaka, Richard Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit the problem of motion planning in the Gaussian belief space. Motivated by the fact that most existing sampling-based planners suffer from high computational costs due to the high-dimensional nature of the problem, we propose an approach that leverages a deep learning model to predict optimal path candidates directly from the problem description. Our proposed approach consists of three steps. First, we prepare a training dataset comprising a large number of input-output pairs: the input image encodes the problem to be solved (e.g., start states, goal states, and obstacle locations), whereas the output image encodes the solution (i.e., the ground truth of the shortest path). Any existing planner can be used to generate this training dataset. Next, we leverage the U-Net architecture to learn the dependencies between the input and output data. Finally, a trained U-Net model is applied to a new problem encoded as an input image. From the U-Net's output image, which is interpreted as a distribution of paths,an optimal path candidate is reconstructed. The proposed method significantly reduces computation time compared to the sampling-based baseline algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Samragh, Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh Vahid, Fartash Faghri, Minsik Cho, Moin Nabi, Devang Naik, Mehrdad Farajtabar</p>
<p>Abstract: The pre-training phase of language models often begins with randomly initialized parameters. With the current trends in scaling models, training their large number of parameters can be extremely slow and costly. In contrast, small language models are less expensive to train, but they often cannot achieve the accuracy of large models. In this paper, we explore an intriguing idea to connect these two different regimes: Can we develop a method to initialize large language models using smaller pre-trained models? Will such initialization bring any benefits in terms of training time and final accuracy? In this paper, we introduce HyperCloning, a method that can expand the parameters of a pre-trained language model to those of a larger model with increased hidden dimensions. Our method ensures that the larger model retains the functionality of the smaller model. As a result, the larger model already inherits the predictive power and accuracy of the smaller model before the training starts. We demonstrate that training such an initialized model results in significant savings in terms of GPU hours required for pre-training large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hector Chahuara, Gonzalo Mateos</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph signal processing deals with algorithms and signal representations that leverage graph structures for multivariate data analysis. Often said graph topology is not readily available and may be time-varying, hence (dynamic) graph structure learning from nodal (e.g., sensor) observations becomes a critical first step. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for online graph learning using observation streams, assumed to be smooth on the latent graph. Unlike batch algorithms for topology identification from smooth signals, our modus operandi is to process graph signals sequentially and thus keep memory and computational costs in check. To solve the resulting smoothness-regularized, time-varying inverse problem, we develop online and lightweight iterations built upon the proximal variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), well known for its fast convergence in batch settings. The proximal term in the topology updates seamlessly implements a temporal-variation regularization, and we argue the online procedure exhibits sublinear static regret under some simplifying assumptions. Reproducible experiments with synthetic and real graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in adapting to streaming signals and tracking slowly-varying network connectivity. The proposed approach also exhibits better tracking performance (in terms of suboptimality), when compared to state-of-the-art online graph learning baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anselm Haselhoff, Kevin Trelenberg, Fabian K\"uppers, Jonas Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual counterfactual explanation (CF) methods modify image concepts, e.g, shape, to change a prediction to a predefined outcome while closely resembling the original query image. Unlike self-explainable models (SEMs) and heatmap techniques, they grant users the ability to examine hypothetical "what-if" scenarios. Previous CF methods either entail post-hoc training, limiting the balance between transparency and CF quality, or demand optimization during inference. To bridge the gap between transparent SEMs and CF methods, we introduce the GdVAE, a self-explainable model based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), featuring a Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and integrated CF explanations. Full transparency is achieved through a generative classifier that leverages class-specific prototypes for the downstream task and a closed-form solution for CFs in the latent space. The consistency of CFs is improved by regularizing the latent space with the explainer function. Extensive comparisons with existing approaches affirm the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality CF explanations while preserving transparency. Code and models are public.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) by aligning them with human preferences across diverse tasks. Traditional approaches to create instruction tuning datasets face serious challenges for low-resource languages due to their dependence on data annotation. This work introduces a novel method, Multilingual Reverse Instructions (MURI), which generates high-quality instruction tuning datasets for low-resource languages without requiring human annotators or pre-existing multilingual models. Utilizing reverse instructions and a translation pipeline, MURI produces instruction-output pairs from existing human-written texts in low-resource languages. This method ensures cultural relevance and diversity by sourcing texts from different native domains and applying filters to eliminate inappropriate content. Our dataset, MURI-IT, includes more than 2 million instruction-output pairs across 200 languages. Evaluation by native speakers and fine-tuning experiments with mT5 models demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for both NLU and open-ended generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Bingxin Xu, Weitai Kang, Mu Cai, Yuheng Li, Zehao Wen, Zhen Dong, Kurt Keutzer, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire various strategies for integrating video modalities. A key approach is Video-LLMs, which incorporate an optimizable interface linking sophisticated video encoders to LLMs. However, due to computation and data limitations, these Video-LLMs are typically pre-trained to process only short videos, limiting their broader application for understanding longer video content. Additionally, fine-tuning Video-LLMs to handle longer videos is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, it becomes essential to explore the interpolation of Video-LLMs under a completely training-free setting. In this paper, we first identify the primary challenges in interpolating Video-LLMs: (1) the video encoder and modality alignment projector are fixed, preventing the integration of additional frames into Video-LLMs, and (2) the LLM backbone is limited in its content length capabilities, which complicates the processing of an increased number of video tokens. To address these challenges, we propose a specific INTerPolation method for Video-LLMs (INTP-Video-LLMs). We introduce an alternative video token rearrangement technique that circumvents limitations imposed by the fixed video encoder and alignment projector. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free LLM context window extension method to enable Video-LLMs to understand a correspondingly increased number of visual tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been extensively used for mining graph-structured data with impressive performance. However, because these traditional GNNs do not distinguish among various downstream tasks, embeddings embedded by them are not always effective. Intuitively, paths in a graph imply different semantics for different downstream tasks. Inspired by this, we design a novel GNN solution, namely Customized Graph Neural Network with Path Reweighting (CustomGNN for short). Specifically, the proposed CustomGNN can automatically learn the high-level semantics for specific downstream tasks to highlight semantically relevant paths as well to filter out task-irrelevant noises in a graph. Furthermore, we empirically analyze the semantics learned by CustomGNN and demonstrate its ability to avoid the three inherent problems in traditional GNNs, i.e., over-smoothing, poor robustness, and overfitting. In experiments with the node classification task, CustomGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on three standard graph datasets and four large graph datasets. The source code of the proposed CustomGNN is available at \url{https://github.com/cjpcool/CustomGNN}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongbo Kong, Kyunghun Kim, Suk-Ju Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) have demonstrated remarkable success due to their class-wise controllability and superior quality for complex generation tasks. Typical cGANs solve the joint distribution matching problem by decomposing two easier sub-problems: marginal matching and conditional matching. In this paper, we proposes a simple but effective training methodology, selective focusing learning, which enforces the discriminator and generator to learn easy samples of each class rapidly while maintaining diversity. Our key idea is to selectively apply conditional and joint matching for the data in each mini-batch.Specifically, we first select the samples with the highest scores when sorted using the conditional term of the discriminator outputs (real and generated samples). Then we optimize the model using the selected samples with only conditional matching and the other samples with joint matching. From our toy experiments, we found that it is the best to apply only conditional matching to certain samples due to the content-aware optimization of the discriminator. We conducted experiments on ImageNet (64x64 and 128x128), CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 datasets, and Mixture of Gaussian, noisy label settings to demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially (up to 35.18% in terms of FID) improve all indicators with 10 independent trials.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gandharv Patil, Prashanth L. A., Dheeraj Nagaraj, Doina Precup</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the finite-time behaviour of the popular temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm when combined with tail-averaging. We derive finite time bounds on the parameter error of the tail-averaged TD iterate under a step-size choice that does not require information about the eigenvalues of the matrix underlying the projected TD fixed point. Our analysis shows that tail-averaged TD converges at the optimal $O\left(1/t\right)$ rate, both in expectation and with high probability. In addition, our bounds exhibit a sharper rate of decay for the initial error (bias), which is an improvement over averaging all iterates. We also propose and analyse a variant of TD that incorporates regularisation. From analysis, we conclude that the regularised version of TD is useful for problems with ill-conditioned features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Zellinger, Peter B\"uhlmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Cluster analysis relies on effective benchmarks for evaluating and comparing different algorithms. Simulation studies on synthetic data are popular because important features of the data sets, such as the overlap between clusters, or the variation in cluster shapes, can be effectively varied. Unfortunately, curating evaluation scenarios is often laborious, as practitioners must find lower-level geometric parameters (like cluster covariance matrices) to match a higher-level scenario description like "clusters with very different shapes." To make benchmarks more convenient and informative, we propose synthetic data generation based on data set archetypes. In this paradigm, the user describes an evaluation scenario in a high-level manner, and the software automatically generates data sets with the desired characteristics. Combining such data set archetypes with large language models (LLMs), it is possible to set up benchmarks purely from verbal descriptions of the evaluation scenarios. We provide an open-source Python package, repliclust, that implements this workflow. A demo of data generation from verbal inputs is available at https://demo.repliclust.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yurui Lai, Taiyan Zhang, Rui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been highly successful for the node classification task. GNNs typically assume graphs are homophilic, i.e. neighboring nodes are likely to belong to the same class. However, a number of real-world graphs are heterophilic, and this leads to much lower classification accuracy using standard GNNs. In this work, we design a novel GNN which is effective for both heterophilic and homophilic graphs. Our work is based on three main observations. First, we show that node features and graph topology provide different amounts of informativeness in different graphs, and therefore they should be encoded independently and prioritized in an adaptive manner. Second, we show that allowing negative attention weights when propagating graph topology information improves accuracy. Finally, we show that asymmetric attention weights between nodes are helpful. We design a GNN which makes use of these observations through a novel self-attention mechanism. We evaluate our algorithm on real-world graphs containing thousands to millions of nodes and show that we achieve state-of-the-art results compared to existing GNNs. We also analyze the effectiveness of the main components of our design on different graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afsana Khan, Marijn ten Thij, Frank Thuijsman, Anna Wilbik</p>
<p>Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising approach for collaboratively training machine learning models using private data partitioned vertically across different parties. Ideally in a VFL setting, the active party (party possessing features of samples with labels) benefits by improving its machine learning model through collaboration with some passive parties (parties possessing additional features of the same samples without labels) in a privacy preserving manner. However, motivating passive parties to participate in VFL can be challenging. In this paper, we focus on the problem of allocating incentives to the passive parties by the active party based on their contributions to the VFL process. We address this by formulating the incentive allocation problem as a bankruptcy game, a concept from cooperative game theory. Using the Talmudic division rule, which leads to the Nucleolus as its solution, we ensure a fair distribution of incentives. We evaluate our proposed method on synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it ensures fairness and stability in incentive allocation among passive parties who contribute their data to the federated model. Additionally, we compare our method to the existing solution of calculating Shapley values and show that our approach provides a more efficient solution with fewer computations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations.</p>

  We propose a thorough approach to studying these risks: a novel type of competition that allows a realistic and detailed investigation of problems in financial transaction data. The participants directly oppose each other, proposing attacks and defenses -- so they are examined in close-to-real-life conditions.
  The paper outlines our unique competition structure with direct opposition of participants, presents results for several different top submissions, and analyzes the competition results. We also introduce a new open dataset featuring financial transactions with credit default labels, enhancing the scope for practical research and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Philipp Klein, Thomas B\"ack, Anna V. Kononova</p>
<p>Abstract: A clear need for automatic anomaly detection applied to automotive testing has emerged as more and more attention is paid to the data recorded and manual evaluation by humans reaches its capacity. Such real-world data is massive, diverse, multivariate and temporal in nature, therefore requiring modelling of the testee behaviour. We propose a variational autoencoder with multi-head attention (MA-VAE), which, when trained on unlabelled data, not only provides very few false positives but also manages to detect the majority of the anomalies presented. In addition to that, the approach offers a novel way to avoid the bypass phenomenon, an undesirable behaviour investigated in literature. Lastly, the approach also introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. The results are presented in the context of a real-world industrial data set and several experiments are undertaken to further investigate certain aspects of the proposed model. When configured properly, it is 9% of the time wrong when an anomaly is flagged and discovers 67% of the anomalies present. Also, MA-VAE has the potential to perform well with only a fraction of the training and validation subset, however, to extract it, a more sophisticated threshold estimation method is required.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objective: Our aim is to determine if data collected with inertial measurement units (IMUs) during steady-state running could be used to estimate ground reaction forces (GRFs) and to derive biomechanical variables (e.g., contact time, impulse, change in velocity) using lightweight machine-learning approaches. In contrast, state-of-the-art estimation using LSTMs suffers from prohibitive inference times on edge devices, requires expensive training and hyperparameter optimization, and results in black box models. Methods: We proposed a novel lightweight solution, SVD Embedding Regression (SER), using linear regression between SVD embeddings of IMU data and GRF data. We also compared lightweight solutions including SER and k-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) regression with state-of-the-art LSTMs. Results: We performed extensive experiments to evaluate these techniques under multiple scenarios and combinations of IMU signals and quantified estimation errors for predicting GRFs and biomechanical variables. We did this using training data from different athletes, from the same athlete, or both, and we explored the use of acceleration and angular velocity data from sensors at different locations (sacrum and shanks). Conclusion: Our results illustrated that lightweight solutions such as SER and KNN can be similarly accurate or more accurate than LSTMs. The use of personal data reduced estimation errors of all methods, particularly for most biomechanical variables (as compared to GRFs); moreover, this gain was more pronounced in the lightweight methods. Significance: The study of GRFs is used to characterize the mechanical loading experienced by individuals in movements such as running, which is clinically applicable to identify athletes at risk for stress-related injuries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hourun Li, Yusheng Zhao, Zhengyang Mao, Yifang Qin, Zhiping Xiao, Jiaqi Feng, Yiyang Gu, Wei Ju, Xiao Luo, Ming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is crucial for improving traffic congestion, reducing accidents, optimizing urban planning, and more. However, the complexity of traffic networks has rendered traditional machine learning and statistical methods less effective. With the advent of artificial intelligence, deep learning frameworks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields and are now considered highly effective in many areas. Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising deep learning approach within the ITS domain, owing to their robust ability to model graph-structured data and address complex problems. Consequently, there has been increasing scholarly attention to the applications of GNNs in transportation, which have demonstrated excellent performance. Nevertheless, current research predominantly focuses on traffic forecasting, with other ITS domains, such as autonomous vehicles and demand prediction, receiving less attention. This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs across six representative and emerging ITS research areas: traffic forecasting, vehicle control system, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and parking management. We have examined a wide range of graph-related studies from 2018 to 2023, summarizing their methodologies, features, and contributions in detailed tables and lists. Additionally, we identify the challenges of applying GNNs in ITS and propose potential future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicki Barari, Xin Lian, Christopher J. MacLellan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have excelled in machine learning, particularly in vision tasks, however, they often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. In this work, we introduce Cobweb4V, an alternative to traditional neural network approaches. Cobweb4V is a novel visual classification method that builds on Cobweb, a human like learning system that is inspired by the way humans incrementally learn new concepts over time. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation, showcasing Cobweb4Vs proficiency in learning visual concepts, requiring less data to achieve effective learning outcomes compared to traditional methods, maintaining stable performance over time, and achieving commendable asymptotic behavior, without catastrophic forgetting effects. These characteristics align with learning strategies in human cognition, positioning Cobweb4V as a promising alternative to neural network approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjie Li, Jingyi Liu, Weijun Li, Lina Yu, Min Wu, Wenqiang Li, Meilan Hao, Su Wei, Yusong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical formulas are the crystallization of human wisdom in exploring the laws of nature for thousands of years. Describing the complex laws of nature with a concise mathematical formula is a constant pursuit of scientists and a great challenge for artificial intelligence. This field is called symbolic regression (SR). Symbolic regression was originally formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, and Genetic Programming (GP) and Reinforcement Learning algorithms were used to solve it. However, GP is sensitive to hyperparameters, and these two types of algorithms are inefficient. To solve this problem, researchers treat the mapping from data to expressions as a translation problem. And the corresponding large-scale pre-trained model is introduced. However, the data and expression skeletons do not have very clear word correspondences as the two languages do. Instead, they are more like two modalities (e.g., image and text). Therefore, in this paper, we proposed MMSR. The SR problem is solved as a pure multi-modal problem, and contrastive learning is also introduced in the training process for modal alignment to facilitate later modal feature fusion. It is worth noting that to better promote the modal feature fusion, we adopt the strategy of training contrastive learning loss and other losses at the same time, which only needs one-step training, instead of training contrastive learning loss first and then training other losses. Because our experiments prove training together can make the feature extraction module and feature fusion module wearing-in better. Experimental results show that compared with multiple large-scale pre-training baselines, MMSR achieves the most advanced results on multiple mainstream datasets including SRBench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjian Luo, Yangfan Jiang, Fei Wei, Yuncheng Wu, Xiaokui Xiao, Beng Chin Ooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive generative performance in terms of both sampling quality and distribution coverage. Accordingly, proposals are made for sharing pre-trained diffusion models across different organizations, as a way of improving data utilization while enhancing privacy protection by avoiding sharing private data directly. However, the potential risks associated with such an approach have not been comprehensively examined.
  In this paper, we take an adversarial perspective to investigate the potential privacy and fairness risks associated with the sharing of diffusion models. Specifically, we investigate the circumstances in which one party (the sharer) trains a diffusion model using private data and provides another party (the receiver) black-box access to the pre-trained model for downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the sharer can execute fairness poisoning attacks to undermine the receiver's downstream models by manipulating the training data distribution of the diffusion model. Meanwhile, the receiver can perform property inference attacks to reveal the distribution of sensitive features in the sharer's dataset. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable attack performance on different types of diffusion models, which highlights the critical importance of robust data auditing and privacy protection protocols in pertinent applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Wang, Fei Deng, Peifan Jiang, Zishan Gong, Xiaolin Wei, Yuqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data a crucial step in seismic data processing. Traditional methods for seismic data reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data. With the development of deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful reconstruction capabilities. However, these convolutional neural networks represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the entire distribution of the dataset. Consequently, when dealing with seismic data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying degrees of performance degradation. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data. To constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be reconstructed. We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space. Additionally, we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency. Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing patterns.

<p>Abstract: We pursue the use of deep learning methods to improve state-of-the-art computations in theoretical high-energy physics. Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory is a close cousin to the theory that describes Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider; its scattering amplitudes are large mathematical expressions containing integer coefficients. In this paper, we apply Transformers to predict these coefficients. The problem can be formulated in a language-like representation amenable to standard cross-entropy training objectives. We design two related experiments and show that the model achieves high accuracy (> 98%) on both tasks. Our work shows that Transformers can be applied successfully to problems in theoretical physics that require exact solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Khoi Duong, Stefan Conrad</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we deal with bias mitigation techniques that remove specific data points from the training set to aim for a fair representation of the population in that set. Machine learning models are trained on these pre-processed datasets, and their predictions are expected to be fair. However, such approaches may exclude relevant data, making the attained subsets less trustworthy for further usage. To enhance the trustworthiness of prior methods, we propose additional requirements and objectives that the subsets must fulfill in addition to fairness: (1) group coverage, and (2) minimal data loss. While removing entire groups may improve the measured fairness, this practice is very problematic as failing to represent every group cannot be considered fair. In our second concern, we advocate for the retention of data while minimizing discrimination. By introducing a multi-objective optimization problem that considers fairness and data loss, we propose a methodology to find Pareto-optimal solutions that balance these objectives. By identifying such solutions, users can make informed decisions about the trade-off between fairness and data quality and select the most suitable subset for their application. Our method is distributed as a Python package via PyPI under the name FairDo (https://github.com/mkduong-ai/fairdo).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shifan Zhao (Carl), Jiaying Lu (Carl), Ji Yang (Carl), Edmond Chow, Yuanzhe Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used in statistics and machine learning for prediction tasks requiring uncertainty measures. Its efficacy depends on the appropriate specification of the mean function, covariance kernel function, and associated hyperparameters. Severe misspecifications can lead to inaccurate results and problematic consequences, especially in safety-critical applications. However, a systematic approach to handle these misspecifications is lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose a general framework to address these issues. Firstly, we introduce a flexible two-stage GPR framework that separates mean prediction and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to prevent mean misspecification, which can introduce bias into the model. Secondly, kernel function misspecification is addressed through a novel automatic kernel search algorithm, supported by theoretical analysis, that selects the optimal kernel from a candidate set. Additionally, we propose a subsampling-based warm-start strategy for hyperparameter initialization to improve efficiency and avoid hyperparameter misspecification. With much lower computational cost, our subsampling-based strategy can yield competitive or better performance than training exclusively on the full dataset. Combining all these components, we recommend two GPR methods-exact and scalable-designed to match available computational resources and specific UQ requirements. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets, including UCI benchmarks and a safety-critical medical case study, demonstrates the robustness and precision of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Khoi Duong, Stefan Conrad</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the recital (67) of the current corrigendum of the AI Act in the European Union, we propose and present measures and mitigation strategies for discrimination in tabular datasets. We specifically focus on datasets that contain multiple protected attributes, such as nationality, age, and sex. This makes measuring and mitigating bias more challenging, as many existing methods are designed for a single protected attribute. This paper comes with a twofold contribution: Firstly, new discrimination measures are introduced. These measures are categorized in our framework along with existing ones, guiding researchers and practitioners in choosing the right measure to assess the fairness of the underlying dataset. Secondly, a novel application of an existing bias mitigation method, FairDo, is presented. We show that this strategy can mitigate any type of discrimination, including intersectional discrimination, by transforming the dataset. By conducting experiments on real-world datasets (Adult, Bank, COMPAS), we demonstrate that de-biasing datasets with multiple protected attributes is possible. All transformed datasets show a reduction in discrimination, on average by 28%. Further, these datasets do not compromise any of the tested machine learning models' performances significantly compared to the original datasets. Conclusively, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy used and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the implementation of the European Union's AI Act.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lokman Saleh, Hafedh Mili, Mounir Boukadoum, Abderrahmane Leshob</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain experts from all fields are called upon, working with data scientists, to explore the use of ML techniques to solve their problems. Starting from a domain problem/question, ML-based problem-solving typically involves three steps: (1) formulating the business problem (problem domain) as a data analysis problem (solution domain), (2) sketching a high-level ML-based solution pattern, given the domain requirements and the properties of the available data, and (3) designing and refining the different components of the solution pattern. There has to be a substantial body of ML problem solving knowledge that ML researchers agree on, and that ML practitioners routinely apply to solve the most common problems. Our work deals with capturing this body of knowledge, and embodying it in a ML problem solving workbench to helps domain specialists who are not ML experts to explore the ML solution space. This paper focuses on: 1) the representation of domain problems, ML problems, and the main ML solution artefacts, and 2) a heuristic matching function that helps identify the ML algorithm family that is most appropriate for the domain problem at hand, given the domain (expert) requirements, and the characteristics of the training data. We review related work and outline our strategy for validating the workbench</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in deep learning necessitate better training methods for deep neural networks (DNNs). As models grow in complexity, vanishing and exploding gradients impede performance. We propose Z-Score Normalization for Gradient Descent (ZNorm), an innovative technique that adjusts only the gradients to accelerate training and improve model performance. ZNorm normalizes the overall gradients, providing consistent gradient scaling across layers, thereby reducing the risks of vanishing and exploding gradients, having better performances. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets demonstrate that ZNorm enhances performance metrics. ZNorm consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior results using the same experimental settings. In medical imaging applications, ZNorm improves tumor prediction and segmentation performances, underscoring its practical utility. These findings highlight ZNorm's potential as a robust and versatile tool for enhancing the training speed and effectiveness of deep neural networks across a wide range of architectures and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sascha Marton, Tim Grams, Florian Vogt, Stefan L\"udtke, Christian Bartelt, Heiner Stuckenschmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant success across various domains, but its adoption is often limited by the black-box nature of neural network policies, making them difficult to interpret. In contrast, symbolic policies allow representing decision-making strategies in a compact and interpretable way. However, learning symbolic policies directly within on-policy methods remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SYMPOL, a novel method for SYMbolic tree-based on-POLicy RL. SYMPOL employs a tree-based model integrated with a policy gradient method, enabling the agent to learn and adapt its actions while maintaining a high level of interpretability. We evaluate SYMPOL on a set of benchmark RL tasks, demonstrating its superiority over alternative tree-based RL approaches in terms of performance and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method, that allows a gradient-based end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees within existing on-policy RL algorithms. Therefore, SYMPOL can become the foundation for a new class of interpretable RL based on decision trees. Our implementation is available under: https://github.com/s-marton/SYMPOL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lefan Zhang, Xiaodan Wang, Yanhua Huang, Ruiwen Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Dong, Zhengyang Li, Liangwei Zheng, Weitong Chen, Wei Emma Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmalya Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Jiao, Ce Guo, Wayne Luk</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery identifies causal relationships in data, but the task is more complex for multivariate time series due to the computational demands of methods like VarLiNGAM, which combines a Vector Autoregressive Model with a Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model. This study optimizes causal discovery specifically for time series data, which are common in practical applications. Time series causal discovery is particularly challenging because of temporal dependencies and potential time lag effects. By developing a specialized dataset generator and reducing the computational complexity of the VarLiNGAM model from \( O(m^3 \cdot n) \) to \( O(m^3 + m^2 \cdot n) \), this study enhances the feasibility of processing large datasets. The proposed methods were validated on advanced computational platforms and tested on simulated, real-world, and large-scale datasets, demonstrating improved efficiency and performance. The optimized algorithm achieved 7 to 13 times speedup compared to the original and about 4.5 times speedup compared to the GPU-accelerated version on large-scale datasets with feature sizes from 200 to 400. Our methods extend current causal discovery capabilities, making them more robust, scalable, and applicable to real-world scenarios, facilitating advancements in fields like healthcare and finance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peyman Milanfar, Mauricio Delbracio</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising, the process of reducing random fluctuations in a signal to emphasize essential patterns, has been a fundamental problem of interest since the dawn of modern scientific inquiry. Recent denoising techniques, particularly in imaging, have achieved remarkable success, nearing theoretical limits by some measures. Yet, despite tens of thousands of research papers, the wide-ranging applications of denoising beyond noise removal have not been fully recognized. This is partly due to the vast and diverse literature, making a clear overview challenging.
  This paper aims to address this gap. We present a clarifying perspective on denoisers, their structure, and desired properties. We emphasize the increasing importance of denoising and showcase its evolution into an essential building block for complex tasks in imaging, inverse problems, and machine learning. Despite its long history, the community continues to uncover unexpected and groundbreaking uses for denoising, further solidifying its place as a cornerstone of scientific and engineering practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronald Katende</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for eigenvalue computation using a distributed cooperative neural network framework. Unlike traditional techniques that face scalability challenges in large systems, our decentralized algorithm enables multiple autonomous agents to collaboratively estimate the smallest eigenvalue of large matrices. Each agent employs a localized neural network, refining its estimates through communication with neighboring agents. Our empirical results confirm the algorithm's convergence towards the true eigenvalue, with estimates clustered closely around the true value. Even in the presence of communication delays or network disruptions, the method demonstrates strong robustness and scalability. Theoretical analysis further validates the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach, while empirical tests highlight its efficiency and precision, surpassing traditional centralized algorithms in large-scale eigenvalue computations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panayiotis Panayiotou, \"Ozg\"ur \c{S}im\c{s}ek</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust policies enable reinforcement learning agents to effectively adapt to and operate in unpredictable, dynamic, and ever-changing real-world environments. Factored representations, which break down complex state and action spaces into distinct components, can improve generalization and sample efficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we explore how the curriculum of an agent using a factored state representation affects the robustness of the learned policy. We experimentally demonstrate three simple curricula, such as varying only the variable of highest regret between episodes, that can significantly enhance policy robustness, offering practical insights for reinforcement learning in complex environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in plan generation. Yet, existing datasets often lack the complexity needed for advanced tool use scenarios - such as handling paraphrased query statements, supporting multiple languages, and managing actions that can be done in parallel. These scenarios are crucial for evaluating the evolving capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. Moreover, current datasets don't enable the study of LLMs from a process perspective, particularly in scenarios where understanding typical behaviors and challenges in executing the same process under different conditions or formulations is crucial. To address these gaps, we present the ProcessTBench synthetic dataset, an extension of the TaskBench dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLMs within a process mining framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, time series foundation models have shown promising zero-shot forecasting performance on time series from a wide range of domains. However, it remains unclear whether their success stems from a true understanding of temporal dynamics or simply from memorizing the training data. While implicit reasoning in language models has been studied, similar evaluations for time series models have been largely unexplored. This work takes an initial step toward assessing the reasoning abilities of deep time series forecasting models. We find that certain linear, MLP-based, and patch-based Transformer models generalize effectively in systematically orchestrated out-of-distribution scenarios, suggesting underexplored reasoning capabilities beyond simple pattern memorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lawrence Zhang, Adam Yang, Rodz Andrie Amor, Bryan Zhang, Dhruv Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Weather forecasting is a vitally important tool for tasks ranging from planning day to day activities to disaster response planning. However, modeling weather has proven to be challenging task due to its chaotic and unpredictable nature. Each variable, from temperature to precipitation to wind, all influence the path the environment will take. As a result, all models tend to rapidly lose accuracy as the temporal range of their forecasts increase. Classical forecasting methods use a myriad of physics-based, numerical, and stochastic techniques to predict the change in weather variables over time. However, such forecasts often require a very large amount of data and are extremely computationally expensive. Furthermore, as climate and global weather patterns change, classical models are substantially more difficult and time-consuming to update for changing environments. Fortunately, with recent advances in deep learning and publicly available high quality weather datasets, deploying learning methods for estimating these complex systems has become feasible. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models have comparable accuracy to the industry standard numerical models and are becoming more ubiquitous in practice due to their adaptability. Our group seeks to improve upon existing deep learning based forecasting methods by increasing spatial resolutions of global weather predictions. Specifically, we are interested in performing super resolution (SR) on GraphCast temperature predictions by increasing the global precision from 1 degree of accuracy to 0.5 degrees, which is approximately 111km and 55km respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments, agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text, or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation. While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial. We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Graf, Tobias Harks, Kostas Kollias, Michael Markl</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a dynamic traffic assignment model, where agents base their instantaneous routing decisions on real-time delay predictions. We formulate a mathematically concise model and define dynamic prediction equilibrium (DPE) in which no agent can at any point during their journey improve their predicted travel time by switching to a different route. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by showing that it subsumes the well-known full information and instantaneous information models, in addition to admitting further realistic predictors as special cases. We then proceed to derive properties of the predictors that ensure a dynamic prediction equilibrium exists. Additionally, we define $\varepsilon$-approximate DPE wherein no agent can improve their predicted travel time by more than $\varepsilon$ and provide further conditions of the predictors under which such an approximate equilibrium can be computed. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis by an experimental study, in which we systematically compare the induced average travel times of different predictors, including two machine-learning based models trained on data gained from previously computed approximate equilibrium flows, both on synthetic and real world road networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibakar Das, Vikram Seshasai, Vineet Sudhir Bhat, Pushkal Juneja, Jyotsna Bapat, Debabrata Das</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-intrusive system failure prediction technique using available information from developers and minimal information from raw logs (rather than mining entire logs) but keeping the data entirely private with the data owners. A neural network based multi-class classifier is developed for failure prediction, using artificially generated anonymous data set, applying a combination of techniques, viz., genetic algorithm (steps), pattern repetition, etc., to train and test the network. The proposed mechanism completely decouples the data set used for training process from the actual data which is kept private. Moreover, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) schemes are used to prioritize failures meeting business requirements. Results show high accuracy in failure prediction under different parameter configurations. On a broader context, any classification problem, beyond failure prediction, can be performed using the proposed mechanism with artificially generated data set without looking into the actual data as long as the input features can be translated to binary values (e.g. output from private binary classifiers) and can provide classification-as-a-service.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renrui Zhang, Jiaming Han, Chris Liu, Peng Gao, Aojun Zhou, Xiangfei Hu, Shilin Yan, Pan Lu, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiming Li, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, Baocheng Geng, Pramod K. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection (CD) in heterogeneous remote sensing images has been widely used for disaster monitoring and land-use management. In the past decade, the heterogeneous CD problem has significantly benefited from the development of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the purely data-driven DNNs perform like a black box where the lack of interpretability limits the trustworthiness and controllability of DNNs in most practical CD applications. As a powerful knowledge-driven tool, copula theory performs well in modeling relationships among random variables. To enhance the interpretability of existing neural networks for CD, we propose a knowledge-data-driven heterogeneous CD method based on a copula-guided neural network, named NN-Copula-CD. In our NN-Copula-CD, the mathematical characteristics of copula are employed as the loss functions to supervise a neural network to learn the dependence between bi-temporal heterogeneous superpixel pairs, and then the changed regions are identified via binary classification based on the degrees of dependence of all the superpixel pairs in the bi-temporal images. We conduct in-depth experiments on three datasets with heterogeneous images, where both quantitative and visual results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed NN-Copula-CD method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Duk Park, Cong Tran, Won-Yong Shin, Xin Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmeng Huang, Kan Xu, Donghwan Lee, Hamed Hassani, Hamsa Bastani, Edgar Dobriban</p>
<p>Abstract: Large and complex datasets are often collected from several, possibly heterogeneous sources. Multitask learning methods improve efficiency by leveraging commonalities across datasets while accounting for possible differences among them. Here, we study multitask linear regression and contextual bandits under sparse heterogeneity, where the source/task-associated parameters are equal to a global parameter plus a sparse task-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage estimator called MOLAR that leverages this structure by first constructing a covariate-wise weighted median of the task-wise linear regression estimates and then shrinking the task-wise estimates towards the weighted median. Compared to task-wise least squares estimates, MOLAR improves the dependence of the estimation error on the data dimension. Extensions of MOLAR to generalized linear models and constructing confidence intervals are discussed in the paper. We then apply MOLAR to develop methods for sparsely heterogeneous multitask contextual bandits, obtaining improved regret guarantees over single-task bandit methods. We further show that our methods are minimax optimal by providing a number of lower bounds. Finally, we support the efficiency of our methods by performing experiments on both synthetic data and the PISA dataset on student educational outcomes from heterogeneous countries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swastika Roy, Hatim Chergui, Christos Verikoukis</p>
<p>Abstract: Future zero-touch artificial intelligence (AI)-driven 6G network automation requires building trust in the AI black boxes via explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), where it is expected that AI faithfulness would be a quantifiable service-level agreement (SLA) metric along with telecommunications key performance indicators (KPIs). This entails exploiting the XAI outputs to generate transparent and unbiased deep neural networks (DNNs). Motivated by closed-loop (CL) automation and explanation-guided learning (EGL), we design an explanation-guided federated learning (EGFL) scheme to ensure trustworthy predictions by exploiting the model explanation emanating from XAI strategies during the training run time via Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. Specifically, we predict per-slice RAN dropped traffic probability to exemplify the proposed concept while respecting fairness goals formulated in terms of the recall metric which is included as a constraint in the optimization task. Finally, the comprehensiveness score is adopted to measure and validate the faithfulness of the explanations quantitatively. Simulation results show that the proposed EGFL-JS scheme has achieved more than $50\%$ increase in terms of comprehensiveness compared to different baselines from the literature, especially the variant EGFL-KL that is based on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. It has also improved the recall score with more than $25\%$ relatively to unconstrained-EGFL.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose reinforcement learning to control the dynamical self-assembly of the dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) from patchy particles. The patchy particles have anisotropic interactions with other particles and form DDQC. However, their structures at steady states are significantly influenced by the kinetic pathways of their structural formation. We estimate the best policy of temperature control trained by the Q-learning method and demonstrate that we can generate DDQC with few defects using the estimated policy. It is found that reinforcement learning autonomously discovers a characteristic temperature at which structural fluctuations enhance the chance of forming a globally stable state. The estimated policy guides the system toward the characteristic temperature to assist the formation of DDQC. We also illustrate the performance of RL when the target is metastable or unstable. To clarify the success of the learning, we analyse a simple model describing the kinetics of structural changes through the motion in a triple-well potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vik Shirvaikar, Xi Lin, Chris Holmes</p>
<p>Abstract: The estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) across different subgroups in a population is of significant interest in clinical trial analysis. State-of-the-art HTE estimation methods, including causal forests (Wager and Athey, 2018), generally rely on recursive partitioning for non-parametric identification of relevant covariates and interactions. However, like many other methods in this area, causal forests partition subgroups based on differences in absolute risk. This can dilute statistical power by masking variability in the relative risk, which is often a more appropriate quantity of clinical interest. In this work, we propose and implement a methodology for modifying causal forests to target relative risk, using a novel node-splitting procedure based on exhaustive generalized linear model comparison. We present results that suggest relative risk causal forests can capture otherwise undetected sources of heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangyu Zhang, Yang Peng, Jiadong Liang, Wenhao Yang, Zhihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study distributional reinforcement learning from the perspective of statistical efficiency. We investigate distributional policy evaluation, aiming to estimate the complete return distribution (denoted $\eta^\pi$) attained by a given policy $\pi$. We use the certainty-equivalence method to construct our estimator $\hat\eta^\pi$, given a generative model is available. In this circumstance we need a dataset of size $\widetilde O\left(\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{\varepsilon^{2p}(1-\gamma)^{2p+2}}\right)$ to guarantee the $p$-Wasserstein metric between $\hat\eta^\pi$ and $\eta^\pi$ less than $\varepsilon$ with high probability. This implies the distributional policy evaluation problem can be solved with sample efficiency. Also, we show that under different mild assumptions a dataset of size $\widetilde O\left(\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{\varepsilon^{2}(1-\gamma)^{4}}\right)$ suffices to ensure the Kolmogorov metric and total variation metric between $\hat\eta^\pi$ and $\eta^\pi$ is below $\varepsilon$ with high probability. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of $\hat\eta^\pi$. We demonstrate that the ``empirical process'' $\sqrt{n}(\hat\eta^\pi-\eta^\pi)$ converges weakly to a Gaussian process in the space of bounded functionals on Lipschitz function class $\ell^\infty(\mathcal{F}_{\text{W}})$, also in the space of bounded functionals on indicator function class $\ell^\infty(\mathcal{F}_{\text{KS}})$ and bounded measurable function class $\ell^\infty(\mathcal{F}_{\text{TV}})$ when some mild conditions hold. Our findings give rise to a unified approach to statistical inference of a wide class of statistical functionals of $\eta^\pi$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letitia Parcalabescu, Anette Frank</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) in practical scenarios is significantly challenged by the presence of missing or incomplete data across different modalities. To overcome these challenges, researchers have aimed to simulate incomplete conditions during the training phase to enhance the system's overall robustness. Traditional methods have often involved discarding data or substituting data segments with zero vectors to approximate these incompletenesses. However, such approaches neither accurately represent real-world conditions nor adequately address the issue of noisy data availability. For instance, a blurry image cannot be simply replaced with zero vectors, while still retaining information. To tackle this issue and develop a more precise MER system, we introduce a novel noise-robust MER model that effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data. This approach includes two pivotal components: firstly, a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the data to emulate various realistic incomplete situations. Secondly, a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based module is employed to reconstruct these robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy inputs. Notably, the introduction of the noise scheduler enables the exploration of an entirely new type of incomplete data condition, which is impossible with existing methods. Extensive experimental evaluations on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate the effectiveness of the noise scheduler and the excellent performance of our proposed model.

<p>Abstract: Hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is asymmetric and spatially inhomogeneous. While extensive work has been done on volume and shape analysis of atrophy of the hippocampus in AD, less attention has been given to hippocampal asymmetry specifically. Previous studies of hippocampal asymmetry are limited to global volume or shape measures, which don't localize shape asymmetry at the point level. In this paper, we propose to quantify localized shape asymmetry by optimizing point correspondences between left and right hippocampi within a subject, while simultaneously favoring a compact statistical shape model of the entire sample. To account for related variables that have impact on AD and healthy subject differences, we build linear models with other confounding factors. Our results on the OASIS3 dataset demonstrate that compared to using volumetric information, shape asymmetry reveals fine-grained, localized differences that indicate the hippocampal regions of most significant shape asymmetry in AD patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jae Hyung Ju, Jaiyoung Park, Jongmin Kim, Minsik Kang, Donghwan Kim, Jung Hee Cheon, Jung Ho Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a promising cryptographic primitive for realizing private neural network inference (PI) services by allowing a client to fully offload the inference task to a cloud server while keeping the client data oblivious to the server. This work proposes NeuJeans, an FHE-based solution for the PI of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). NeuJeans tackles the critical problem of the enormous computational cost for the FHE evaluation of CNNs. We introduce a novel encoding method called Coefficients-in-Slot (CinS) encoding, which enables multiple convolutions in one HE multiplication without costly slot permutations. We further observe that CinS encoding is obtained by conducting the first several steps of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on a ciphertext in conventional Slot encoding. This property enables us to save the conversion between CinS and Slot encodings as bootstrapping a ciphertext starts with DFT. Exploiting this, we devise optimized execution flows for various two-dimensional convolution (conv2d) operations and apply them to end-to-end CNN implementations. NeuJeans accelerates the performance of conv2d-activation sequences by up to 5.68 times compared to state-of-the-art FHE-based PI work and performs the PI of a CNN at the scale of ImageNet within a mere few seconds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lintao Ye, Aritra Mitra, Vijay Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem being solved in a model-free manner using the policy gradient approach. If the gradient of the quadratic cost is being transmitted across a rate-limited channel, both the convergence and the rate of convergence of the resulting controller may be affected by the bit-rate permitted by the channel. We first pose this problem in a communication-constrained optimization framework and propose a new adaptive quantization algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent (AQGD). This algorithm guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the globally optimal policy, with no deterioration of the exponent relative to the unquantized setting, above a certain finite threshold bit-rate allowed by the communication channel. We then propose a variant of AQGD that provides similar performance guarantees when applied to solve the model-free LQR problem. Our approach reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in preserving fast linear convergence rates, and, as such, may be of independent interest to the literature on compressed optimization. Our work also marks a first step towards a more general bridge between the fields of model-free control design and networked control systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanran Guan, Oliver van Kaick</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods that use neural networks for synthesizing 3D shapes in the form of a part-based representation have been introduced over the last few years. These methods represent shapes as a graph or hierarchy of parts and enable a variety of applications such as shape sampling and reconstruction. However, current methods do not allow easily regenerating individual shape parts according to user preferences. In this paper, we investigate techniques that allow the user to generate multiple, diverse suggestions for individual parts. Specifically, we experiment with multimodal deep generative models that allow sampling diverse suggestions for shape parts and focus on models which have not been considered in previous work on shape synthesis. To provide a comparative study of these techniques, we introduce a method for synthesizing 3D shapes in a part-based representation and evaluate all the part suggestion techniques within this synthesis method. In our method, which is inspired by previous work, shapes are represented as a set of parts in the form of implicit functions which are then positioned in space to form the final shape. Synthesis in this representation is enabled by a neural network architecture based on an implicit decoder and a spatial transformer. We compare the various multimodal generative models by evaluating their performance in generating part suggestions. Our contribution is to show with qualitative and quantitative evaluations which of the new techniques for multimodal part generation perform the best and that a synthesis method based on the top-performing techniques allows the user to more finely control the parts that are generated in the 3D shapes while maintaining high shape fidelity when reconstructing shapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soaad Hossain, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the success of ChatGPT, LaMDA and other large language models (LLMs), there has been an increase in development and usage of LLMs within the technology sector and other sectors. While the level in which LLMs has not reached a level where it has surpassed human intelligence, there will be a time when it will. Such LLMs can be referred to as advanced LLMs. Currently, there are limited usage of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) principles and guidelines addressing advanced LLMs due to the fact that we have not reached that point yet. However, this is a problem as once we do reach that point, we will not be adequately prepared to deal with the aftermath of it in an ethical and optimal way, which will lead to undesired and unexpected consequences. This paper addresses this issue by discussing what ethical AI principles and guidelines can be used to address highly advanced LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matvei Anoshin, Asel Sagingalieva, Christopher Mansell, Dmitry Zhiganov, Vishal Shete, Markus Pflitsch, Alexey Melnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: The drug design process currently requires considerable time and resources to develop each new compound that enters the market. This work develops an application of hybrid quantum generative models based on the integration of parametrized quantum circuits into known molecular generative adversarial networks, and proposes quantum cycle architectures that improve model performance and stability during training. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark drug design datasets, QM9 and PC9, the introduced models are shown to outperform the previously achieved scores. Most prominently, the new scores indicate an increase of up to 30% in the quantitative estimation of druglikeness. The new hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms, as well as the achieved scores of pharmacokinetic properties, contribute to the development of fast and accurate drug discovery processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ossi R\"ais\"a, Joonas J\"alk\"o, Antti Honkela</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how the batch size affects the total gradient variance in differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), seeking a theoretical explanation for the usefulness of large batch sizes. As DP-SGD is the basis of modern DP deep learning, its properties have been widely studied, and recent works have empirically found large batch sizes to be beneficial. However, theoretical explanations of this benefit are currently heuristic at best. We first observe that the total gradient variance in DP-SGD can be decomposed into subsampling-induced and noise-induced variances. We then prove that in the limit of an infinite number of iterations, the effective noise-induced variance is invariant to the batch size. The remaining subsampling-induced variance decreases with larger batch sizes, so large batches reduce the effective total gradient variance. We confirm numerically that the asymptotic regime is relevant in practical settings when the batch size is not small, and find that outside the asymptotic regime, the total gradient variance decreases even more with large batch sizes. We also find a sufficient condition that implies that large batch sizes similarly reduce effective DP noise variance for one iteration of DP-SGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chrisantus Eze, Christopher Crick</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we explore the innovative domain of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) as a framework for training Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models via distributed networks. Conventional machine learning models frequently grapple with issues about data privacy and the exposure of sensitive information. Our proposed Federated Quantum Neural Network (FedQNN) framework emerges as a cutting-edge solution, integrating the singular characteristics of QML with the principles of classical federated learning. This work thoroughly investigates QFL, underscoring its capability to secure data handling in a distributed environment and facilitate cooperative learning without direct data sharing. Our research corroborates the concept through experiments across varied datasets, including genomics and healthcare, thereby validating the versatility and efficacy of our FedQNN framework. The results consistently exceed 86% accuracy across three distinct datasets, proving its suitability for conducting various QML tasks. Our research not only identifies the limitations of classical paradigms but also presents a novel framework to propel the field of QML into a new era of secure and collaborative innovation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models enable efficient analytics across knowledge domains, rivalling human experts in information comparisons. However, the applications of LLMs for information comparisons face scalability challenges due to the difficulties in maintaining information across large contexts and overcoming model token limitations. To address these challenges, we developed the novel Abstractive Summarization & Criteria-driven Comparison Endpoint (ASC$^2$End) system to automate information comparison at scale. Our system employs Semantic Text Similarity comparisons for generating evidence-supported analyses. We utilize proven data-handling strategies such as abstractive summarization and retrieval augmented generation to overcome token limitations and retain relevant information during model inference. Prompts were designed using zero-shot strategies to contextualize information for improved model reasoning. We evaluated abstractive summarization using ROUGE scoring and assessed the generated comparison quality using survey responses. Models evaluated on the ASC$^2$End system show desirable results providing insights on the expected performance of the system. ASC$^2$End is a novel system and tool that enables accurate, automated information comparison at scale across knowledge domains, overcoming limitations in context length and retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Tomas Arias-Vergara, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Tobias Weise, Kai Packhaeuser, Maria Schuster, Elmar Noeth, Andreas Maier, Seung Hee Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Integration of speech into healthcare has intensified privacy concerns due to its potential as a non-invasive biomarker containing individual biometric information. In response, speaker anonymization aims to conceal personally identifiable information while retaining crucial linguistic content. However, the application of anonymization techniques to pathological speech, a critical area where privacy is especially vital, has not been extensively examined. This study investigates anonymization's impact on pathological speech across over 2,700 speakers from multiple German institutions, focusing on privacy, pathological utility, and demographic fairness. We explore both deep-learning-based and signal processing-based anonymization methods. We document substantial privacy improvements across disorders-evidenced by equal error rate increases up to 1933%, with minimal overall impact on utility. Specific disorders such as Dysarthria, Dysphonia, and Cleft Lip and Palate experience minimal utility changes, while Dysglossia shows slight improvements. Our findings underscore that the impact of anonymization varies substantially across different disorders. This necessitates disorder-specific anonymization strategies to optimally balance privacy with diagnostic utility. Additionally, our fairness analysis reveals consistent anonymization effects across most of the demographics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of anonymization in pathological speech for enhancing privacy, while also highlighting the importance of customized and disorder-specific approaches to account for inversion attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Monninger, Vandana Dokkadi, Md Zafar Anwar, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maitreya Shelare, Neha Shigvan, Atharva Satam, Poonam Sonar</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of remote-sensing image classification has seen immense progress with the rise of convolutional neural networks, and more recently, through vision transformers. These models, with their self-attention mechanism, can effectively capture global relationships and long-range dependencies between the image patches, in contrast with traditional convolutional models. This paper introduces StrideNET, a dual-branch transformer-based model developed for terrain recognition and surface roughness extraction. The terrain recognition branch employs the Swin Transformer to classify varied terrains by leveraging its capability to capture both local and global features. Complementing this, the roughness extraction branch utilizes a statistical texture-feature analysis technique to dynamically extract important land surface properties such as roughness and slipperiness. The model was trained on a custom dataset consisting of four terrain classes - grassy, marshy, sandy, and rocky, and it outperforms benchmark CNN and transformer based models, by achieving an average test accuracy of over 99 % across all classes. The applications of this work extend to different domains such as environmental monitoring, land use and cover classification, disaster response and precision agriculture.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents to manage sensitive user data raises significant privacy concerns. While these agents excel at understanding and acting on context, this capability can be exploited by malicious actors. We introduce a novel threat model where adversarial third-party apps manipulate the context of interaction to trick LLM-based agents into revealing private information not relevant to the task at hand.
  Grounded in the framework of contextual integrity, we introduce AirGapAgent, a privacy-conscious agent designed to prevent unintended data leakage by restricting the agent's access to only the data necessary for a specific task. Extensive experiments using Gemini, GPT, and Mistral models as agents validate our approach's effectiveness in mitigating this form of context hijacking while maintaining core agent functionality. For example, we show that a single-query context hijacking attack on a Gemini Ultra agent reduces its ability to protect user data from 94% to 45%, while an AirGapAgent achieves 97% protection, rendering the same attack ineffective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eura Nofshin, Esther Brown, Brian Lim, Weiwei Pan, Finale Doshi-Velez</p>
<p>Abstract: Explanations of an AI's function can assist human decision-makers, but the most useful explanation depends on the decision's context, referred to as the downstream task. User studies are necessary to determine the best explanations for each task. Unfortunately, testing every explanation and task combination is impractical, especially considering the many factors influencing human+AI collaboration beyond the explanation's content. This work leverages two insights to streamline finding the most effective explanation. First, explanations can be characterized by properties, such as faithfulness or complexity, which indicate if they contain the right information for the task. Second, we introduce XAIsim2real, a pipeline for running synthetic user studies. In our validation study, XAIsim2real accurately predicts user preferences across three tasks, making it a valuable tool for refining explanation choices before full studies. Additionally, it uncovers nuanced relationships, like how cognitive budget limits a user's engagement with complex explanations -- a trend confirmed with real users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhe Gao, Difei Gu, Mu Zhou, Dimitris Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Although explainability is essential in the clinical diagnosis, most deep learning models still function as black boxes without elucidating their decision-making process. In this study, we investigate the explainable model development that can mimic the decision-making process of human experts by fusing the domain knowledge of explicit diagnostic criteria. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, Explicd, towards Explainable language-informed criteria-based diagnosis. Explicd initiates its process by querying domain knowledge from either large language models (LLMs) or human experts to establish diagnostic criteria across various concept axes (e.g., color, shape, texture, or specific patterns of diseases). By leveraging a pretrained vision-language model, Explicd injects these criteria into the embedding space as knowledge anchors, thereby facilitating the learning of corresponding visual concepts within medical images. The final diagnostic outcome is determined based on the similarity scores between the encoded visual concepts and the textual criteria embeddings. Through extensive evaluation of five medical image classification benchmarks, Explicd has demonstrated its inherent explainability and extends to improve classification performance compared to traditional black-box models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Zhang, Minho Heo, Zuxin Liu, Erdem Biyik, Joseph J Lim, Yao Liu, Rasool Fakoor</p>
<p>Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods focus on learning optimal policies over low-level action spaces. While these methods can perform well in their training environments, they lack the flexibility to transfer to new tasks. Instead, RL agents that can act over useful, temporally extended skills rather than low-level actions can learn new tasks more easily. Prior work in skill-based RL either requires expert supervision to define useful skills, which is hard to scale, or learns a skill-space from offline data with heuristics that limit the adaptability of the skills, making them difficult to transfer during downstream RL. Our approach, EXTRACT, instead utilizes pre-trained vision language models to extract a discrete set of semantically meaningful skills from offline data, each of which is parameterized by continuous arguments, without human supervision. This skill parameterization allows robots to learn new tasks by only needing to learn when to select a specific skill and how to modify its arguments for the specific task. We demonstrate through experiments in sparse-reward, image-based, robot manipulation environments that EXTRACT can more quickly learn new tasks than prior works, with major gains in sample efficiency and performance over prior skill-based RL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amanda Olmin, Fredrik Lindsten</p>
<p>Abstract: Epoch-wise double descent is the phenomenon where generalisation performance improves beyond the point of overfitting, resulting in a generalisation curve exhibiting two descents under the course of learning. Understanding the mechanisms driving this behaviour is crucial not only for understanding the generalisation behaviour of machine learning models in general, but also for employing conventional selection methods, such as the use of early stopping to mitigate overfitting. While we ultimately want to draw conclusions of more complex models, such as deep neural networks, a majority of theoretical results regarding the underlying cause of epoch-wise double descent are based on simple models, such as standard linear regression. In this paper, to take a step towards more complex models in theoretical analysis, we study epoch-wise double descent in two-layer linear neural networks. First, we derive a gradient flow for the linear two-layer model, that bridges the learning dynamics of the standard linear regression model, and the linear two-layer diagonal network with quadratic weights. Second, we identify additional factors of epoch-wise double descent emerging with the extra model layer, by deriving necessary conditions for the generalisation error to follow a double descent pattern. While epoch-wise double descent in linear regression has been attributed to differences in input variance, in the two-layer model, also the singular values of the input-output covariance matrix play an important role. This opens up for further questions regarding unidentified factors of epoch-wise double descent for truly deep models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Cheng Chen, Yi-Tien Li, Tai-Yu Li, Chen-Yu Liu, Cheng-Yu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CompressedMediQ, a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline specifically developed to address the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional multi-class neuroimaging data analysis. Standard neuroimaging datasets, such as 4D MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia (NIFD), present significant hurdles due to their vast size and complexity. CompressedMediQ integrates classical high-performance computing (HPC) nodes for advanced MRI pre-processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-PCA-based feature extraction and reduction, addressing the limited-qubit availability for quantum data encoding in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. This is followed by Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classification. By utilizing quantum kernel methods, the pipeline optimizes feature mapping and classification, enhancing data separability and outperforming traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques. Experimental results highlight the pipeline's superior accuracy in dementia staging, validating the practical use of quantum machine learning in clinical diagnostics. Despite the limitations of NISQ devices, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced learning, paving the way for scalable and precise diagnostic tools in healthcare and signal processing.</p>

We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Dutta, Pavana P Karanth, Pedro Maciel Xavier, Iago Leal de Freitas, Nouhaila Innan, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique, David E. Bernal Neira</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.</p>
