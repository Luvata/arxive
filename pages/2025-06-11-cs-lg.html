<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Li, Song Liu, Weiguo Wu, Shiqiang Nie, Jinyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a semi-supervised approach that disaggregates refugee statistics from administrative boundaries to 0.5-degree grid cells across 25 Sub-Saharan African countries. By integrating UNHCR's ProGres registration data with satellite-derived building footprints from Google Open Buildings and location coordinates from OpenStreetMap Populated Places, our label spreading algorithm creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and national statistics. The resulting high-resolution dataset provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of displacement drivers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Ying Chen, Chuan-Xian Ren, Hong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level transport provides essential structure information for the class-level knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08021">FlowBERT: Prompt-tuned BERT for variable flow field prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Zou, Weibing Feng, Pin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a universal flow field prediction framework based on knowledge transfer
  from large language model (LLM), addressing the high computational costs of traditional
  computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and the limited cross-condition transfer capability
  of existing deep learning models. The framework innovatively integrates Proper Orthogonal
  Decomposition (POD) dimensionality reduction with fine-tuning strategies for pretrained LLM,
  where POD facilitates compressed representation of flow field features while the fine-tuned model
  learns to encode system dynamics in state space. To enhance the model's adaptability to flow field
  data, we specifically designed fluid dynamics-oriented text templates that improve predictive
  performance through enriched contextual semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate
  that our framework outperforms conventional Transformer models in few-shot learning scenarios while
  exhibiting exceptional generalization across various inflow conditions and airfoil geometries.
  Ablation studies reveal the contributions of key components in the FlowBERT architecture. Compared
  to traditional Navier-Stokes equation solvers requiring hours of computation, our approach reduces
  prediction time to seconds while maintaining over 90% accuracy. The developed knowledge transfer
  paradigm establishes a new direction for rapid fluid dynamics prediction, with potential
  applications extending to aerodynamic optimization, flow control, and other engineering domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Liu, Tianyi Xiong, Ruibo Chen, Yihan Wu, Junfeng Guo, Tianyi Zhou, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asit Mishra, Dusan Stosic, Simon Layton</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX) formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmuda Sultana Mimi, Md Monzurul Islam, Anannya Ghosh Tusti, Shriyank Somvanshi, Subasish Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV) crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Wang, Hao Peng, Senzhang Wang, Haohua Du, Chunyang Liu, Jia Wu, Guanlin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/STAMImupter.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08060">Eliciting Fine-Tuned Transformer Capabilities via Inference-Time Techniques</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Asankhaya Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l \log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$ is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon} \right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension. Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging theory to real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woosung Kim, Jinho Lee, Jongmin Lee, Byung-Jun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective. FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songqiao Hu, Zeyi Liu, Xiao He</p>
<p>Abstract: The change in data distribution over time, also known as concept drift, poses a significant challenge to the reliability of online learning methods. Existing methods typically require model retraining or drift detection, both of which demand high computational costs and are often unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, a lightweight, fast and efficient random vector functional-link network termed Lite-RVFL is proposed, capable of adapting to concept drift without drift detection and retraining. Lite-RVFL introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is derived. Experimental results on a real-world safety assessment task validate the efficiency, effectiveness in adapting to drift, and potential to capture temporal patterns of Lite-RVFL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Qin, Hailun Xu, Wei Chee Yew, Qi Jia, Yang Luo, Kanchan Sarkar, Danhui Guan, Kai Wang, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K, Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/Info-Coevolution/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timoth\'ee Hornek Amir Sartipi, Igor Tchappi, Gilbert Fridgen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanbing Liu, Lang Cao, Yuanyi Ren, Mengyu Zhou, Haoyu Dong, Xiaojun Ma, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy, with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens, and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly for efficient reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviad Susman, Mayte Su\'arez-Fari\~nas, Joseph T Colonel</p>
<p>Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner, traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements. As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI, building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources, select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404 coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid, and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Tonin, Alex Lambert, Johan A. K. Suykens, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness of decision-making algorithms is an increasingly important issue. In this paper, we focus on spectral clustering with group fairness constraints, where every demographic group is represented in each cluster proportionally as in the general population. We present a new efficient method for fair spectral clustering (Fair SC) by casting the Fair SC problem within the difference of convex functions (DC) framework. To this end, we introduce a novel variable augmentation strategy and employ an alternating direction method of multipliers type of algorithm adapted to DC problems. We show that each associated subproblem can be solved efficiently, resulting in higher computational efficiency compared to prior work, which required a computationally expensive eigendecomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing significant speedups in computation time over prior art, especially as the problem size grows. This work thus represents a considerable step forward towards the adoption of fair clustering in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahidullah Ta\c{c}, Amirhossein Amiri-Hezaveh, Manuel K. Rausch, Grace N. Bechtel, Francisco Sahli Costabal, Adrian Buganza Tepole</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to classical inverse methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Reisizadeh, Jinghan Jia, Zhiqi Bu, Bhanukiran Vinzamuri, Anil Ramakrishna, Kai-Wei Chang, Volkan Cevher, Sijia Liu, Mingyi Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem (which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning (\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunny Gupta, Nikita Jangid, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work, we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions, effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in resource-constrained settings.

<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that leverages edge computing on client devices to optimize models while maintaining user privacy by ensuring that local data remains on the device. However, since all data is collected by clients, federated learning is susceptible to latent noise in local datasets. Factors such as limited measurement capabilities or human errors may introduce inaccuracies in client data. To address this challenge, we propose the use of a stochastic neural network as the local model within the federated learning framework. Stochastic neural networks not only facilitate the estimation of the true underlying states of the data but also enable the quantification of latent noise. We refer to our federated learning approach, which incorporates stochastic neural networks as local models, as Federated stochastic neural networks. We will present numerical experiments demonstrating the performance and effectiveness of our method, particularly in handling non-independent and identically distributed data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh V Nguyen, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, with rising concerns for data privacy, Federated Learning has gained prominence, as it enables collaborative training without the aggregation of raw data from participating clients. However, much of the current focus has been on parametric gradient-based models, while nonparametric counterparts such as decision tree are relatively understudied. Existing methods for adapting decision trees to Federated Learning generally combine a greedy tree-building algorithm with differential privacy to produce a global model for all clients. These methods are limited to classification trees and categorical data due to the constraints of differential privacy. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that utilizes Genetic Algorithm to facilitate the construction of personalized decision trees and accommodate categorical and numerical data, thus allowing for both classification and regression trees. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses decision trees trained solely on local data and a benchmark algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: This monograph explores the design and analysis of correlated noise mechanisms for differential privacy (DP), focusing on their application to private training of AI and machine learning models via the core primitive of estimation of weighted prefix sums. While typical DP mechanisms inject independent noise into each step of a stochastic gradient (SGD) learning algorithm in order to protect the privacy of the training data, a growing body of recent research demonstrates that introducing (anti-)correlations in the noise can significantly improve privacy-utility trade-offs by carefully canceling out some of the noise added on earlier steps in subsequent steps. Such correlated noise mechanisms, known variously as matrix mechanisms, factorization mechanisms, and DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) when applied to learning algorithms, have also been influential in practice, with industrial deployment at a global scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadab Anwar Shaikh, Kranthi Balusu, Ayoub Soulami</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual stresses, which remain within a component after processing, can deteriorate performance. Accurately determining their full-field distributions is essential for optimizing the structural integrity and longevity. However, the experimental effort required for full-field characterization is impractical. Given these challenges, this work proposes a machine learning (ML) based Residual Stress Generator (RSG) to infer full-field stresses from limited measurements. An extensive dataset was initially constructed by performing numerous process simulations with a diverse parameter set. A ML model based on U-Net architecture was then trained to learn the underlying structure through systematic hyperparameter tuning. Then, the model's ability to generate simulated stresses was evaluated, and it was ultimately tested on actual characterization data to validate its effectiveness. The model's prediction of simulated stresses shows that it achieved excellent predictive accuracy and exhibited a significant degree of generalization, indicating that it successfully learnt the latent structure of residual stress distribution. The RSG's performance in predicting experimentally characterized data highlights the feasibility of the proposed approach in providing a comprehensive understanding of residual stress distributions from limited measurements, thereby significantly reducing experimental efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahaf Bassan, Guy Amir, Meirav Zehavi, Guy Katz</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble models are widely recognized in the ML community for their limited interpretability. For instance, while a single decision tree is considered interpretable, ensembles of trees (e.g., boosted trees) are often treated as black-boxes. Despite this folklore recognition, there remains a lack of rigorous mathematical understanding of what particularly makes an ensemble (un)-interpretable, including how fundamental factors like the (1) *number*, (2) *size*, and (3) *type* of base models influence its interpretability. In this work, we seek to bridge this gap by applying concepts from computational complexity theory to study the challenges of generating explanations for various ensemble configurations. Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity patterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under standard complexity assumptions like P$\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains intractable even when base models are of constant size. Surprisingly, the complexity changes drastically with the number of base models: small ensembles of decision trees are efficiently interpretable, whereas interpreting ensembles with even a constant number of linear models remains intractable. We believe that our findings provide a more robust foundation for understanding the interpretability of ensembles, emphasizing the benefits of examining it through a computational complexity lens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Feeney, Kuei-Hsiang Huang, Aparna Chandramowlishwaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Operator learning enables data-driven modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning mappings between function spaces. However, scaling transformer-based operator models to high-resolution, multiscale domains remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of attention and its coupling to discretization. We introduce \textbf{Mondrian}, transformer operators that decompose a domain into non-overlapping subdomains and apply attention over sequences of subdomain-restricted functions. Leveraging principles from domain decomposition, Mondrian decouples attention from discretization. Within each subdomain, it replaces standard layers with expressive neural operators, and attention across subdomains is computed via softmax-based inner products over functions. The formulation naturally extends to hierarchical windowed and neighborhood attention, supporting both local and global interactions. Mondrian achieves strong performance on Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes PDEs, demonstrating resolution scaling without retraining. These results highlight the promise of domain-decomposed attention for scalable and general-purpose neural operators.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology. However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups. By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD, this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.</p>

Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong generalization performance across various single source domain generalization (sDG) benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning tasks when guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, they tend to produce highly confident yet incorrect outputs, which poses significant risks in domains like education, where users may lack the expertise to assess reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a structured framework that models stepwise confidence as a temporal signal and evaluates it using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In particular, we define formal STL-based constraints to capture desirable temporal properties and compute robustness scores that serve as structured, interpretable confidence estimates. Our approach also introduces a set of uncertainty reshaping strategies to enforce smoothness, monotonicity, and causal consistency across the reasoning trajectory. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than conventional confidence aggregation and post-hoc calibration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions, embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive, with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patryk Krukowski, {\L}ukasz Gorczyca, Piotr Helm, Kamil Ksi\k{a}\.zek, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice, we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately. Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD (Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaswanth Chittepu, Blossom Metevier, Will Schwarzer, Austin Hoag, Scott Niekum, Philip S. Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and helpfulness compared to previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.</p>

The former is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact neural networks with strong performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarushri N. S.</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable, and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems, modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles. Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Manoel Herrera Pinheiro, Suzana Vilas Boas de Oliveira, Thiago Henrique Segreto Silva, Pedro Antonio Rabelo Saraiva, Enzo Ferreira de Souza, Leonardo Andr\'e Ambrosio, Marcelo Becker</p>
<p>Abstract: This research addresses the critical lack of comprehensive studies on feature scaling by systematically evaluating 12 scaling techniques - including several less common transformations - across 14 different Machine Learning algorithms and 16 datasets for classification and regression tasks. We meticulously analyzed impacts on predictive performance (using metrics such as accuracy, MAE, MSE, and $R^2$) and computational costs (training time, inference time, and memory usage). Key findings reveal that while ensemble methods (such as Random Forest and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM) demonstrate robust performance largely independent of scaling, other widely used models such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show significant performance variations highly dependent on the chosen scaler. This extensive empirical analysis, with all source code, experimental results, and model parameters made publicly available to ensure complete transparency and reproducibility, offers model-specific crucial guidance to practitioners on the need for an optimal selection of feature scaling techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xie Yi, Zhanke Zhou, Chentao Cao, Qiyu Niu, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward, conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically, ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models, confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful multi-LLM ensembles.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08295">From Passive to Active Reasoning: Can Large Language Models Ask the Right Questions under Incomplete Information?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanke Zhou, Xiao Feng, Zhaocheng Zhu, Jiangchao Yao, Sanmi Koyejo, Bo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills. AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies, such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung-Kien Nguyen, Heng Ping, Shixuan Li, Peiyu Zhang, Nikos Kanakaris, Nicholas Kotov, Paul Bogdan</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Tieu, Dongqi Fu, Zihao Li, Ross Maciejewski, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, L-STEP obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/L-STEP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom\'as Gonz\'alez, Giulia Fanti, Aaditya Ramdas</p>
<p>Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original, establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alan N. Amin, Nate Gruver, Andrew Gordon Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice, however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is, surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that outperform masking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingbo Fu, Zehong Wang, Zihan Chen, Jiazheng Li, Yaochen Zhu, Zhenyu Lei, Cong Shen, Yanfang Ye, Chuxu Zhang, Jundong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhyeok Choi, Chenglin Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, formulated as discretizations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), achieve state-of-the-art generative performance. However, existing analyses of their discretization error often rely on complex probabilistic tools. In this work, we present a simplified theoretical framework for analyzing the Euler--Maruyama discretization of variance-preserving SDEs (VP-SDEs) in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), where $ T $ denotes the number of denoising steps in the diffusion process. Our approach leverages Gr\"onwall's inequality to derive a convergence rate of $ \mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/2}) $ under Lipschitz assumptions, significantly streamlining prior proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian noise in the discretization can be replaced by a discrete random variable (e.g., Rademacher or uniform noise) without sacrificing convergence guarantees-an insight with practical implications for efficient sampling. Experiments validate our theory, showing that (1) the error scales as predicted, (2) discrete noise achieves comparable sample quality to Gaussian noise, and (3) incorrect noise scaling degrades performance. By unifying simplified analysis and discrete noise substitution, our work bridges theoretical rigor with practical efficiency in diffusion-based generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emo Todorov</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop an optimization framework centered around a core idea: once a (parametric) policy is specified, control authority is transferred to the policy, resulting in an autonomous dynamical system. Thus we should be able to optimize policy parameters without further reference to controls or actions, and without directly using the machinery of approximate Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. Here we derive simpler algorithms at the autonomous system level, and show that they compute the same quantities as policy gradients and Hessians, natural gradients, proximal methods. Analogs to approximate policy iteration and off-policy learning are also available. Since policy parameters and other system parameters are treated uniformly, the same algorithms apply to behavioral cloning, mechanism design, system identification, learning of state estimators. Tuning of generative AI models is not only possible, but is conceptually closer to the present framework than to Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08347">Differentially Private Relational Learning with Entity-level Privacy Guarantees</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinan Huang, Haoteng Ying, Eli Chien, Rongzhe Wei, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity; and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency. We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach.

In contrast, second-order methods enhance convergence and generalization but typically incur high computational and memory costs. In this work, we introduce NysAct, a scalable first-order gradient preconditioning method that strikes a balance between state-of-the-art first-order and second-order optimization methods. NysAct leverages an eigenvalue-shifted Nystrom method to approximate the activation covariance matrix, which is used as a preconditioning matrix, significantly reducing time and memory complexities with minimal impact on test accuracy. Our experiments show that NysAct not only achieves improved test accuracy compared to both first-order and second-order methods but also demands considerably less computational resources than existing second-order methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Tan, Zhenxiao Cao, Zhangyang Gao, Siyuan Li, Yufei Huang, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) offers unparalleled structural coverage at near-experimental accuracy, positioning it as a valuable resource for data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in training deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse folding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural feature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the conformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized, PDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential for generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct native-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By training the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly captures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly improve inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the critical impact of subtle systematic biases in predicted structures and presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks like inverse folding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yurun Yuan, Tengyang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically, DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution. Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and out-of-distribution generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Cetin, Tianyu Zhao, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs) focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vamshika Sutar, Amandeep Singh, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning, ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme events.</p>

<p>Abstract: Taxonomy Expansion, which models complex concepts and their relations, can be formulated as a set representation learning task. The generalization of set, fuzzy set, incorporates uncertainty and measures the information within a semantic concept, making it suitable for concept modeling. Existing works usually model sets as vectors or geometric objects such as boxes, which are not closed under set operations. In this work, we propose a sound and efficient formulation of set representation learning based on its volume approximation as a fuzzy set. The resulting embedding framework, Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE), satisfies all set operations and compactly approximates the underlying fuzzy set, hence preserving information while being efficient to learn, relying on minimum neural architecture. We empirically demonstrate the power of FUSE on the task of taxonomy expansion, where FUSE achieves remarkable improvements up to 23% compared with existing baselines. Our work marks the first attempt to understand and efficiently compute the embeddings of fuzzy sets.</p>

Traditional methods largely rely on signature analysis, which, despite being a standard practice, can benefit from the integration of advanced ML techniques. In our study, we innovate by combining ML algorithms with a novel unsupervised anomaly generation methodology that takes into account the engine physics model. We propose Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), an unsupervised framework that synthesizes physically plausible faults directly in the frequency domain of healthy current signals. Guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis, SGDA creates diverse and realistic anomalies without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both supervised ML and unsupervised signature analysis, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and reliability along with wide industrial application. The findings highlight the potential of our approach to contribute significantly to the field of engine diagnostics, offering a robust and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licong Lin, Jingfeng Wu, Peter L. Bartlett</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase. However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$, where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting, one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse (i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are also provided to verify our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingmao Yao, Zhichao Lei, Tianyuan Chen, Ziyue Yuan, Xuefan Chen, Jianxiang Liu, Faguo Wu, Xiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts, leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor $Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing $Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG), empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate $Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruichen Jiang, Ali Kavis, Aryan Mokhtari</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of an optimizer on large-scale deep learning models depends critically on fine-tuning the learning rate, often requiring an extensive grid search over base learning rates, schedules, and other hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a principled framework called GALA (Gradient Alignment-based Learning rate Adaptation), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by tracking the alignment between consecutive gradients and using a local curvature estimate. Guided by the convergence analysis, we formulate the problem of selecting the learning rate as a one-dimensional online learning problem. When paired with an online learning algorithm such as Follow-the-Regularized-Leader, our method produces a flexible, adaptive learning rate schedule that tends to increase when consecutive gradients are aligned and decrease otherwise. We establish a data-adaptive convergence rate for normalized SGD equipped with GALA in the smooth, nonconvex setting. Empirically, common optimizers such as SGD and Adam, when augmented with GALA, demonstrate robust performance across a wide range of initial learning rates and perform competitively without the need for tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Lin, Zhe Chen, Xianhao Chen, Wei Ni, Yue Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Fan, Fuyi Wang, Cen Chen, Jianying Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy, at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate, several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however, contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak, which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need for more effective defense methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Wu, Xinyi Zhong, Zhuoran Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model, where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal, observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high- and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and iterations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Guo, Yu Yang, Pan Xu, Anqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets. We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhishuai Liu, Yu Yang, Ruhan Wang, Pan Xu, Dongruo Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference (TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseok Seung, Jaewoo Lee, Hyunsuk Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Second-order optimization methods for training neural networks, such as KFAC, exhibit superior convergence by utilizing curvature information of loss landscape. However, it comes at the expense of high computational burden. In this work, we analyze the two components that constitute the layer-wise Fisher information matrix (FIM) used in KFAC: the Kronecker factors related to activations and pre-activation gradients. Based on empirical observations on their eigenspectra, we propose efficient approximations for them, resulting in a computationally efficient optimization method called MAC. To the best of our knowledge, MAC is the first algorithm to apply the Kronecker factorization to the FIM of attention layers used in transformers and explicitly integrate attention scores into the preconditioning. We also study the convergence property of MAC on nonlinear neural networks and provide two conditions under which it converges to global minima. Our extensive evaluations on various network architectures and datasets show that the proposed method outperforms KFAC and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, end-to-end training time, and memory usage.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yang, Qihui Zhang, Yuyang Liu, Yue Huang, Xiaojun Jia, Kunpeng Ning, Jiayu Yao, Jigang Wang, Hailiang Dai, Yibing Song, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to safety risks during fine-tuning, where small amounts of malicious or harmless data can compromise safeguards. In this paper, building on the concept of alignment direction -- defined by the weight difference between aligned and unaligned models -- we observe that perturbations along this direction preserve model safety. In contrast, perturbations along directions orthogonal to this alignment are strongly linked to harmful direction perturbations, rapidly degrading safety and framing the parameter space as a narrow safety basin. Based on this insight, we propose a methodology for safety fine-tuning called AsFT (Anchoring Safety in Fine-Tuning), which integrates a regularization term into the training objective. This term uses the alignment direction as an anchor to suppress updates in harmful directions, ensuring that fine-tuning is constrained within the narrow safety basin. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that AsFT outperforms Safe LoRA, reducing harmful behavior by 7.60 percent, improving model performance by 3.44 percent, and maintaining robust performance across various experimental settings.

<p>Abstract: We propose an efficient thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics identification (tLaSDI) framework for the reduced-order modeling of parametric nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework integrates autoencoders for dimensionality reduction with newly developed parametric GENERIC formalism-informed neural networks (pGFINNs), which enable efficient learning of parametric latent dynamics while preserving key thermodynamic principles such as free energy conservation and entropy generation across the parameter space. To further enhance model performance, a physics-informed active learning strategy is incorporated, leveraging a greedy, residual-based error indicator to adaptively sample informative training data, outperforming uniform sampling at equivalent computational cost. Numerical experiments on the Burgers' equation and the 1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson equation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, and significant reduction in training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) cost. Moreover, the learned latent space dynamics reveal the underlying thermodynamic behavior of the system, offering valuable insights into the physical-space dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahaf Bassan, Yizhak Yisrael Elboher, Tobias Ladner, Matthias Althoff, Guy Katz</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques. Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process. If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's predictions across different abstraction levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Piland, Chris Sweet, Adam Czakja</p>
<p>Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its gradient-based variants (e.g., GradCAM) have become standard tools for explaining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predictions. However, these approaches typically focus on individual logits, while for neural networks using softmax, the class membership probability estimates depend \textit{only} on the \textit{differences} between logits, not on their absolute values. This disconnect leaves standard CAMs vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, such as passive fooling, where a model is trained to produce misleading CAMs without affecting decision performance. We introduce \textbf{Salience-Hoax Activation Maps (SHAMs)}, an \emph{entropy-aware form of passive fooling} that serves as a benchmark for CAM robustness under adversarial conditions. To address the passive fooling vulnerability, we then propose \textbf{DiffGradCAM}, a novel, lightweight, and contrastive approach to class activation mapping that is both non-suceptible to passive fooling, but also matches the output of standard CAM methods such as GradCAM in the non-adversarial case. Together, SHAM and DiffGradCAM establish a new framework for probing and improving the robustness of saliency-based explanations. We validate both contributions across multi-class tasks with few and many classes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into the physical sciences is reshaping computational paradigms, offering the potential to accelerate demanding simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Yet, persistent challenges in accuracy, generalization, and physical consistency hinder the practical deployment of ML models in scientific domains. To address these limitations and systematically benchmark progress, we organized the ML4CFD competition, centered on surrogate modeling for aerodynamic simulations over two-dimensional airfoils. The competition attracted over 240 teams, who were provided with a curated dataset generated via OpenFOAM and evaluated through a multi-criteria framework encompassing predictive accuracy, physical fidelity, computational efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization. This retrospective analysis reviews the competition outcomes, highlighting several approaches that outperformed baselines under our global evaluation score. Notably, the top entry exceeded the performance of the original OpenFOAM solver on aggregate metrics, illustrating the promise of ML-based surrogates to outperform traditional solvers under tailored criteria. Drawing from these results, we analyze the key design principles of top submissions, assess the robustness of our evaluation framework, and offer guidance for future scientific ML challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Jim\'enez-Gonz\'alez, Miguel C. Soriano, Lucas Lacasa</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions -- as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --. Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters, and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in the training of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Evolutionary Multi-Objective Network Architecture Search (EMNAS) for the first time to optimize neural network architectures in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Autonomous Driving (AD). EMNAS uses genetic algorithms to automate network design, tailored to enhance rewards and reduce model size without compromising performance. Additionally, parallelization techniques are employed to accelerate the search, and teacher-student methodologies are implemented to ensure scalable optimization. This research underscores the potential of transfer learning as a robust framework for optimizing performance across iterative learning processes by effectively leveraging knowledge from earlier generations to enhance learning efficiency and stability in subsequent generations. Experimental results demonstrate that tailored EMNAS outperforms manually designed models, achieving higher rewards with fewer parameters. The findings of these strategies contribute positively to EMNAS for RL in autonomous driving, advancing the field toward better-performing networks suitable for real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Communication system formulation is critical for advancing 6G and future wireless technologies, yet it remains a complex, expertise-intensive task. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus (CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge; second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release related resources to foster further research in this area after the paper is accepted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waiss Azizian, Michael Kirchhof, Eugene Ndiaye, Louis Bethune, Michal Klein, Pierre Ablin, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and, when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when examined across tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for automatic sleep staging, clinical adoption remains limited due to challenges in fair model evaluation, generalization across diverse datasets, model bias, and variability in human annotations. We present SLEEPYLAND, an open-source sleep staging evaluation framework designed to address these barriers. It includes more than 220'000 hours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain (OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders, and hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA architectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single- and multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble combining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting. SOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with macro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in 94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including cases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data as OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked to age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness, no model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical markers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H, DOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on DOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus than any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA cohorts). Finally, we introduce ensemble disagreement metrics - entropy and inter-model divergence based - predicting regions of scorer disagreement with ROC AUCs up to 0.828, offering a data-driven proxy for human uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas A. Pearson, Francesca Cairoli, Luca Bortolussi, Davide Russo, Francesca Zanello</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning approach that harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence to enhance the accuracy of contextual forecasting in sewerage systems. By developing a diffusion-based model that processes multivariate time series data, our system excels at capturing complex correlations across diverse environmental signals, enabling robust predictions even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique, tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have demonstrated the learnability of symbolic computation through end-to-end deep learning. Given a sufficient number of examples of symbolic expressions before and after the target computation, Transformer models - highly effective learners of sequence-to-sequence functions - can be trained to emulate the computation. This development opens up several intriguing challenges and new research directions, which require active contributions from the symbolic computation community. In this work, we introduce Computer Algebra with Transformer (CALT), a user-friendly Python library designed to help non-experts in deep learning train models for symbolic computation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Baldan, Qiang Liu, Alberto Guardone, Nils Thuerey</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiran Purohit, V Venktesh, Sourangshu Bhattacharya, Avishek Anand</p>
<p>Abstract: The in-context learning paradigm with LLMs has been instrumental in advancing a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The selection of few-shot examples (exemplars / demonstration samples) is essential for constructing effective prompts under context-length budget constraints. In this paper, we formulate the exemplar selection task as a top-m best arms identification problem. A key challenge in this setup is the exponentially large number of arms that need to be evaluated to identify the m-best arms. We propose CASE (Challenger Arm Sampling for Exemplar selection), a novel sample-efficient selective exploration strategy that maintains a shortlist of "challenger" arms, which are current candidates for the top-m arms. In each iteration, only one of the arms from this shortlist or the current topm set is pulled, thereby reducing sample complexity and, consequently, the number of LLM evaluations. Furthermore, we model the scores of exemplar subsets (arms) using a parameterized linear scoring function, leading to stochastic linear bandits setting. CASE achieves remarkable efficiency gains of up to 7x speedup in runtime while requiring 7x fewer LLM calls (87% reduction) without sacrificing performance compared to state-of-the-art exemplar selection methods. We release our code and data at https://github.com/kiranpurohit/CASE</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianquan Yan, Hakan Akg\"un, Kenji Kawaguchi, N. Duane Loh, Ching Hua Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Roschmann, Quentin Bouniot, Vasilii Feofanov, Ievgen Redko, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woosung Kim, JunHo Seo, Jongmin Lee, Byung-Jun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) addresses the mismatch between the stationary distribution induced by a policy and the target distribution required for reliable off-policy evaluation (OPE) and policy optimization. DICE-based offline constrained RL particularly benefits from the flexibility of DICE, as it simultaneously maximizes return while estimating costs in offline settings. However, we have observed that recent approaches designed to enhance the offline RL performance of the DICE framework inadvertently undermine its ability to perform OPE, making them unsuitable for constrained RL scenarios. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this limitation: their reliance on a semi-gradient optimization, which solves a fundamentally different optimization problem and results in failures in cost estimation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to enable OPE and constrained RL through semi-gradient DICE. Our method ensures accurate cost estimation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the offline constrained RL benchmark, DSRL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youqi Wu, Jingwei Zhang, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings, such as CLIP, BLIP and their variants, have achieved promising results in aligning representations across modalities. However, these embeddings could underperform compared to state-of-the-art single-modality embeddings on modality-specific tasks. On the other hand, single-modality embeddings excel in their domains but lack cross-modal alignment capabilities. In this work, we focus on the problem of unifying cross-modality and single-modality embeddings to achieve the performance of modality-expert embedding within individual modalities while preserving cross-modal alignment. To this end, we propose RP-KrossFuse, a method that leverages a random projection-based Kronecker product to integrate cross-modal embeddings with single-modality embeddings. RP-KrossFuse aims to fuse the sample-pairwise similarity scores of the fused embeddings and operates efficiently in a specified kernel space and supports scalable implementations via random Fourier features for shift-invariant kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-KrossFuse through several numerical experiments, combining CLIP embeddings with uni-modal image and text embeddings. Our numerical results indicate that RP-KrossFuse achieves competitive modality-specific performance while retaining cross-modal alignment, bridging the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahesh Godavarti</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence, highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamil Jerabek, Jan Luxemburk, Richard Plny, Josef Koumar, Jaroslav Pesek, Karel Hynek</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning has been applied to network traffic classification (TC) for over two decades. While early efforts used shallow models, the latter 2010s saw a shift toward complex neural networks, often reporting near-perfect accuracy. However, it was recently revealed that a simple k-NN baseline using packet sequences metadata (sizes, times, and directions) can be on par or even outperform more complex methods. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon further and evaluate this baseline across 12 datasets and 15 TC tasks, and investigate why it performs so well. Our analysis shows that most datasets contain over 50% redundant samples (identical packet sequences), which frequently appear in both training and test sets due to common splitting practices. This redundancy can lead to overestimated model performance and reduce the theoretical maximum accuracy when identical flows have conflicting labels. Given its distinct characteristics, we further argue that standard machine learning practices adapted from domains like NLP or computer vision may be ill-suited for TC. Finally, we propose new directions for task formulation and evaluation to address these challenges and help realign the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinkwan Jang, Hyungjin Park, Jinmyeong Choi, Taesup Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08662">Optimizing Learned Image Compression on Scalar and Entropy-Constraint Quantization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Borzechowski, Michael Sch\"afer, Heiko Schwarz, Jonathan Pfaff, Detlev Marpe, Thomas Wiegand</p>
<p>Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks. Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and 2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta bitrate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution for on-device or resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diptarka Chakraborty, Kushagra Chatterjee, Debarati Das, Tien Long Nguyen, Romina Nobahari</p>
<p>Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset, potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups. Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems, particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their fair variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phuc Minh Nguyen, Ngoc-Hieu Nguyen, Duy H. M. Nguyen, Anji Liu, An Mai, Binh T. Nguyen, Daniel Sonntag, Khoa D. Doan</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution. IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our implementations are provided publicly at this link.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data. Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in smart grids.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration from the scientific community.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization, providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general, lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration, highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sidhika Balachandar, Shuvom Sadhuka, Bonnie Berger, Emma Pierson, Nikhil Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting, government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect, standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139 types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Dadoun, Soufiane Hayou, Hanan Salam, Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Pierre Youssef</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients as depth increases, a phenomenon closely tied to the spectral behavior of the input-output Jacobian. Prior work has identified critical initialization schemes that ensure Jacobian stability, but these analyses are typically restricted to fully connected networks with i.i.d. weights. In this work, we go significantly beyond these limitations: we establish a general stability theorem for deep neural networks that accommodates sparsity (such as that introduced by pruning) and non-i.i.d., weakly correlated weights (e.g. induced by training). Our results rely on recent advances in random matrix theory, and provide rigorous guarantees for spectral stability in a much broader class of network models. This extends the theoretical foundation for initialization schemes in modern neural networks with structured and dependent randomness.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Sun, David Antony Selby, Yunchuan Huang, Sebastian Vollmer, Seth Flaxman, Anisoara Calinescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing data imputation in tabular datasets remains a pivotal challenge in data science and machine learning, particularly within socioeconomic research. However, real-world socioeconomic datasets are typically subject to strict data protection protocols, which often prohibit public sharing, even for synthetic derivatives. This severely limits the reproducibility and accessibility of benchmark studies in such settings. Further, there are very few publicly available synthetic datasets. Thus, there is limited availability of benchmarks for systematic evaluation of imputation methods on socioeconomic datasets, whether real or synthetic. In this study, we utilize the World Bank's publicly available synthetic dataset, Synthetic Data for an Imaginary Country, which closely mimics a real World Bank household survey while being fully public, enabling broad access for methodological research. With this as a starting point, we derived the IMAGIC-500 dataset: we select a subset of 500k individuals across approximately 100k households with 19 socioeconomic features, designed to reflect the hierarchical structure of real-world household surveys. This paper introduces a comprehensive missing data imputation benchmark on IMAGIC-500 under various missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and missingness ratios (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%). Our evaluation considers the imputation accuracy for continuous and categorical variables, computational efficiency, and impact on downstream predictive tasks, such as estimating educational attainment at the individual level. The results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of statistical, traditional machine learning, and deep learning imputation techniques, including recent diffusion-based methods. The IMAGIC-500 dataset and benchmark aim to facilitate the development of robust imputation algorithms and foster reproducible social science research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Avan, Akramul Azim, Qusay Mahmoud</p>
<p>Abstract: Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor M. Tenorio, Madeline Navarro, Samuel Rey, Santiago Segarra, Antonio G. Marques</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting structural information to guide GNNs.</p>

Our results, by comparing various imputation methods, such as k-Nearest Neighbors, MissForest, Transformers, and Recurrent Neural Networks, indicate that effective data imputation can substantially enhance the quality of the insights derived from water consumption data as we study their effect on accuracy and reliability of water metering data to provide solutions in applications like leak detection and predictive maintenance scheduling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqin Tang, Shujian Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence. Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool for representation learning.

<p>Abstract: We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically tailored for the long decoding of reasoning models. Extended from SeerAttention, SeerAttention-R retains the design of learning attention sparsity through a self-distilled gating mechanism, while removing query pooling to accommodate auto-regressive decoding. With a lightweight plug-in gating, SeerAttention-R is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing pretrained model without modifying the original parameters. We demonstrate that SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse decoding kernel that achieves near-theoretical speedups of up to 9x over FlashAttention-3 on H100 GPU at 90% sparsity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyi Zheng, Seohong Park, Sergey Levine, Benjamin Eysenbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL, including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8 \times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria-Veronica Ciocanel, John T. Nardini, Kevin B. Flores, Erica M. Rutter, Suzanne S. Sindi, Alexandria Volkening</p>
<p>Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation, and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex biological systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyuan Liang, Zachary T. Rewolinski, Abhineet Agarwal, Tiffany M. Tang, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tree-based ensembles such as random forests remain the go-to for tabular data over deep learning models due to their prediction performance and computational efficiency. These advantages have led to their widespread deployment in high-stakes domains, where interpretability is essential for ensuring trustworthy predictions. This has motivated the development of popular local (i.e. sample-specific) feature importance (LFI) methods such as LIME and TreeSHAP. However, these approaches rely on approximations that ignore the model's internal structure and instead depend on potentially unstable perturbations. These issues are addressed in the global setting by MDI+, a feature importance method which exploits an equivalence between decision trees and linear models on a transformed node basis. However, the global MDI+ scores are not able to explain predictions when faced with heterogeneous individual characteristics. To address this gap, we propose Local MDI+ (LMDI+), a novel extension of the MDI+ framework to the sample specific setting. LMDI+ outperforms existing baselines LIME and TreeSHAP in identifying instance-specific signal features, averaging a 10% improvement in downstream task performance across twelve real-world benchmark datasets. It further demonstrates greater stability by consistently producing similar instance-level feature importance rankings across multiple random forest fits. Finally, LMDI+ enables local interpretability use cases, including the identification of closer counterfactuals and the discovery of homogeneous subgroups.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present BioLangFusion, a simple approach for integrating pre-trained DNA, mRNA, and protein language models into unified molecular representations. Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multivariate long-term and efficient time series forecasting is a key requirement for a variety of practical applications, and there are complex interleaving time dynamics in time series data that require decomposition modeling. Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets. Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement, which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF applications.</p>

The effectiveness of such models is often demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models. Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them. Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models, offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation, remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Rubachev, Akim Kotelnikov, Nikolay Kartashev, Artem Babenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets. However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models. We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and prior methods remain better.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Liang, Zhong-Zhi Li, Yeyun Gong, Yang Wang, Hengyuan Zhang, Yelong Shen, Ying Nian Wu, Weizhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation, our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophia Tang, Yinuo Zhang, Alexander Tong, Pranam Chatterjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches, such as flow matching and Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path. However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr\"odinger bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states, and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Schmidt, Prasanga Dhungel, Christoffer L\"offler, Bj\"orn Nieth, Stephan G\"unnemann, Leo Schwinn</p>
<p>Abstract: Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2 state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Zhang, Daman Arora, Song Mei, Andrea Zanette</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models with reinforcement learning (RL) against verifiable rewards significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, yet remains computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling. We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty (SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency. Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence. Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marton Havasi, Brian Karrer, Itai Gat, Ricky T. Q. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid, token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amrith Setlur, Matthew Y. R. Yang, Charlie Snell, Jeremy Greer, Ian Wu, Virginia Smith, Max Simchowitz, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging "negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL, resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3) coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25 scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizhe Dang, Yangyang Guo, Yanjun Zhao, Haishan Ye, Xiaodong Zheng, Guang Dai, Ivor Tsang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks: the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order (ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3, across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed, full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on memory-efficient pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Sanguino, Thomas Kehrenberg, Jose A. Lozano, Novi Quadrianto</p>
<p>Abstract: Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights. Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction - which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack full access to the deployed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Ma, Chenyang Lin, Yao Zhang, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Dong, Jiachen Jiang, Zhihui Zhu, Xia Ning</p>
<p>Abstract: Task vectors offer a compelling mechanism for accelerating inference in in-context learning (ICL) by distilling task-specific information into a single, reusable representation. Despite their empirical success, the underlying principles governing their emergence and functionality remain unclear. This work proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, positing that task vectors act as single in-context demonstrations formed through linear combinations of the original ones. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for this conjecture. First, we show that task vectors naturally emerge in linear transformers trained on triplet-formatted prompts through loss landscape analysis. Next, we predict the failure of task vectors on representing high-rank mappings and confirm this on practical LLMs. Our findings are further validated through saliency analyses and parameter visualization, suggesting an enhancement of task vectors by injecting multiple ones into few-shot prompts. Together, our results advance the understanding of task vectors and shed light on the mechanisms underlying ICL in transformer-based models.</p>

We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Li, Masood Mortazavi, Ning Yan, Yihong Ma, Reza Zafarani</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification. Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent ``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy. Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures. Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the model behavior.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a novel physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft tissue simulation in surgical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter temperature compared to previous best models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore, for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.</p>

In this paper, we investigate ensembles of deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models. Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Liu, Utkarsh Pratiush, Kamyar Barakati, Hiroshi Funakubo, Ching-Che Lin, Jaegyu Kim, Lane W. Martin, Sergei V. Kalinin</p>
<p>Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning, but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex, non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Feng, Gu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a continuous policy-value iteration algorithm where the approximations of the value function of a stochastic control problem and the optimal control are simultaneously updated through Langevin-type dynamics. This framework applies to both the entropy-regularized relaxed control problems and the classical control problems, with infinite horizon. We establish policy improvement and demonstrate convergence to the optimal control under the monotonicity condition of the Hamiltonian. By utilizing Langevin-type stochastic differential equations for continuous updates along the policy iteration direction, our approach enables the use of distribution sampling and non-convex learning techniques in machine learning to optimize the value function and identify the optimal control simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cyrille Kone, Emilie Kaufmann, Laura Richert</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of identifying the Pareto Set under feasibility constraints in a multivariate bandit setting. Specifically, given a $K$-armed bandit with unknown means $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_K \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to identify the set of arms whose mean is not uniformly worse than that of another arm (i.e., not smaller for all objectives), while satisfying some known set of linear constraints, expressing, for example, some minimal performance on each objective. Our focus lies in fixed-confidence identification, for which we introduce an algorithm that significantly outperforms racing-like algorithms and the intuitive two-stage approach that first identifies feasible arms and then their Pareto Set. We further prove an information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm for constrained Pareto Set identification, showing that the sample complexity of our approach is near-optimal. Our theoretical results are supported by an extensive empirical evaluation on a series of benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Usman, Muhammad Ahmad, M. Shahiki Tash, Irina Gelbukh, Rolando Quintero Tellez, Grigori Sidorov</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity. While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators, following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of 0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B). These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline 0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline 0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jared Claypoole, Steven Cheung, Ashish Gehani, Vinod Yegneswaran, Ahmad Ridley</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze two open source deep reinforcement learning agents submitted to the CAGE Challenge 2 cyber defense challenge, where each competitor submitted an agent to defend a simulated network against each of several provided rules-based attack agents. We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of agent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces and by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior of both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By analyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns in infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and defender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally able to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being exploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the various possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and which did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99% ineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding for instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant privileged access to a host. Finally, we discuss the realism of the challenge and ways that the CAGE Challenge 4 has addressed some of our concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Z. Wang, Songwei Ge, Tero Karras, Ming-Yu Liu, Yogesh Balaji</p>
<p>Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12 different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced visio-linguistic reasoning skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouya Agheli, Tugce Kobal, Fran\c{c}ois Durand, Matthew Andrews</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF) metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms, followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the specific criteria within a given scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embedding-based search is widely used in applications such as recommendation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Recently, there is a growing demand to support these capabilities over personal data stored locally on devices. However, maintaining the necessary data structure associated with the embedding-based search is often infeasible due to its high storage overhead. For example, indexing 100 GB of raw data requires 150 to 700 GB of storage, making local deployment impractical. Reducing this overhead while maintaining search quality and latency becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we present LEANN, a storage-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search index optimized for resource-constrained personal devices. LEANN combines a compact graph-based structure with an efficient on-the-fly recomputation strategy to enable fast and accurate retrieval with minimal storage overhead. Our evaluation shows that LEANN reduces index size to under 5% of the original raw data, achieving up to 50 times smaller storage than standard indexes, while maintaining 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds on real-world question answering benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subba Reddy Oota, Khushbu Pahwa, Prachi Jindal, Satya Sai Srinath Namburi, Maneesh Singh, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Bapi S. Raju, Manish Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity. However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping joint information processing in both the systems.

<p>Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage for themselves (see paper and comments for links).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcos Matabuena, Rahul Ghosal, Pavlo Mozharovskyi, Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla, Jukka-Pekka Onnela</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth measures are powerful tools for defining level sets in emerging, non--standard, and complex random objects such as high-dimensional multivariate data, functional data, and random graphs. Despite their favorable theoretical properties, the integration of depth measures into regression modeling to provide prediction regions remains a largely underexplored area of research. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-free uncertainty quantification algorithm based on conditional depth measures--specifically, conditional kernel mean embeddings and an integrated depth measure. These new algorithms can be used to define prediction and tolerance regions when predictors and responses are defined in separable Hilbert spaces. The use of kernel mean embeddings ensures faster convergence rates in prediction region estimation. To enhance the practical utility of the algorithms with finite samples, we also introduce a conformal prediction variant that provides marginal, non-asymptotic guarantees for the derived prediction regions. Additionally, we establish both conditional and unconditional consistency results, as well as fast convergence rates in certain homoscedastic settings. We evaluate the finite--sample performance of our model in extensive simulation studies involving various types of functional data and traditional Euclidean scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through a digital health application related to physical activity, aiming to provide personalized recommendations</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Changjiang, Liang Jiacheng, Cao Bochuan, Chen Jinghui, Wang Ting</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model (LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance, ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom, such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous algorithms can solve convex-concave minimax problems $\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} f(x,y)$ with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ second-order oracle calls using Newton-type methods. This result has been speculated to be optimal because the upper bound is achieved by a natural generalization of the optimal first-order method. In this work, we show an improved upper bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4/7})$ by generalizing the optimal second-order method for convex optimization to solve the convex-concave minimax problem. We further apply a similar technique to lazy Hessian algorithms and show that our proposed algorithm can also be seen as a second-order ``Catalyst'' framework (Lin et al., JMLR 2018) that could accelerate any globally convergent algorithms for solving minimax problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Yang, Fei Ren, Hai-Sui Yu, Xueyu Geng, Pei-Zhi Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network (PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine (TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.</p>

Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However, their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages. For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evan Markou, Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, Stephen Gould</p>
<p>Abstract: Many high-dimensional optimisation problems exhibit rich geometric structures in their set of minimisers, often forming smooth manifolds due to over-parametrisation or symmetries. When this structure is known, at least locally, it can be exploited through reduction mappings that reparametrise part of the parameter space to lie on the solution manifold. These reductions naturally arise from inner optimisation problems and effectively remove redundant directions, yielding a lower-dimensional objective. In this work, we introduce a general framework to understand how such reductions influence the optimisation landscape. We show that well-designed reduction mappings improve curvature properties of the objective, leading to better-conditioned problems and theoretically faster convergence for gradient-based methods. Our analysis unifies a range of scenarios where structural information at optimality is leveraged to accelerate convergence, offering a principled explanation for the empirical gains observed in such optimisation algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hern\'an Maina, Nicol\'as Wolovick, Luciana Benotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware, and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different numerical precision formats and data parallelization strategies impacts both training speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or limited hardware availability are key concerns.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08436">Olica: Efficient Structured Pruning of Large Language Models without Retraining</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiujun He, Huazhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally, to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage, GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyakka Nakada, Shu Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA, quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs. However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning (ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization process.</p>

<p>Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning, their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an application to time series analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting information and it remains unclear how models should address such discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuo Yang, Xingjie Yang, Linhui Yu, Qing Xu, Yan Fang, Xu Wang, Zhengyang Zhou, Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However, existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunny Gupta, Nikita Jangid, Shounak Das, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization, existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both centralized and federated settings.

<p>Abstract: Troubleshooting performance problems of large model training (LMT) is immensely challenging, due to unprecedented scales of modern GPU clusters, the complexity of software-hardware interactions, and the data intensity of the training process. Existing troubleshooting approaches designed for traditional distributed systems or datacenter networks fall short and can hardly apply to real-world training systems. In this paper, we present PerfTracker, the first online troubleshooting system utilizing fine-grained profiling, to diagnose performance issues of large-scale model training in production. PerfTracker can diagnose performance issues rooted in both hardware (e.g., GPUs and their interconnects) and software (e.g., Python functions and GPU operations). It scales to LMT on modern GPU clusters. PerfTracker effectively summarizes runtime behavior patterns of fine-grained LMT functions via online profiling, and leverages differential observability to localize the root cause with minimal production impact. PerfTracker has been deployed as a production service for large-scale GPU clusters of O(10, 000) GPUs (product homepage https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/user-guide/perftracker-online-performance-analysis-diagnostic-tool). It has been used to diagnose a variety of difficult performance issues.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the $D$-decomposition, a non-orthogonal matrix factorization of the form $A \approx P D Q$, where $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, $D \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, and $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$. The decomposition is defined variationally by minimizing a regularized Frobenius loss, allowing control over rank, sparsity, and conditioning. Unlike algebraic factorizations such as LU or SVD, it is computed by alternating minimization. We establish existence and perturbation stability of the solution and show that each update has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$. Benchmarks against truncated SVD, CUR, and nonnegative matrix factorization show improved reconstruction accuracy on MovieLens, MNIST, Olivetti Faces, and gene expression matrices, particularly under sparsity and noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moria Mayala (LPSM), Erwan Scornet (LPSM), Charles Tillier (LMV), Olivier Wintenberger (LPSM)</p>
<p>Abstract: Many classification tasks involve imbalanced data, in which a class is largely underrepresented. Several techniques consists in creating a rebalanced dataset on which a classifier is trained. In this paper, we study theoretically such a procedure, when the classifier is a Centered Random Forests (CRF). We establish a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on the infinite CRF with explicit rates and exact constant. We then prove that the CRF trained on the rebalanced dataset exhibits a bias, which can be removed with appropriate techniques. Based on an importance sampling (IS) approach, the resulting debiased estimator, called IS-ICRF, satisfies a CLT centered at the prediction function value. For high imbalance settings, we prove that the IS-ICRF estimator enjoys a variance reduction compared to the ICRF trained on the original data. Therefore, our theoretical analysis highlights the benefits of training random forests on a rebalanced dataset (followed by a debiasing procedure) compared to using the original data. Our theoretical results, especially the variance rates and the variance reduction, appear to be valid for Breiman's random forests in our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William de Vazelhes, Xiao-Tong Yuan, Bin Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: In sparse optimization, enforcing hard constraints using the $\ell_0$ pseudo-norm offers advantages like controlled sparsity compared to convex relaxations. However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity constraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been developed to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex constraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed constraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of convergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in sparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of sparse optimization with extra support-preserving constraints commonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative hard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection operator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple alternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By introducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality, we provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our algorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under the conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a fundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of the classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection operator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an elegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the zeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art result from de Vazelhes et. al. (2022), even in the case without additional constraints, by allowing us to remove a non-vanishing system error present in their work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengchao Shen, Hourun Zhu, Gongfan Fang, Jianxin Wang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters.
To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation.

<p>Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics, resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Ma, Chang Liu, Weikang Li, Shun-Yao Zhang, L. -M. Duan, Yukai Wu, Dong-Ling Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size. Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate, through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition, we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states, which closely match recent experimental observations that the quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking quantum devices to photoisomerization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Fageot, Peva Blanchard, Gilles Bareilles, L\^e-Nguy\^en Hoang</p>
<p>Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Zheng, Zhifan Feng, Jia Wang, Lanrui Wang, Zheng Lin, Yang Hao, Weiping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods, they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First, they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues. Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62% (49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ciro Benito Raggio, Paolo Zaffino, Maria Francesca Spadea</p>
<p>Abstract: Shortened Abstract
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a widely adopted modality for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). However, CBCT suffers from increased noise, limited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield unit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT) generation from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning (DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity, scanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent multi-center data sharing.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated learning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region, extending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial network was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers in the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.
  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers, with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\pm13.63$ to $85.90\pm7.10$ HU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\pm0.022$ to $0.922\pm0.039$, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\pm0.94$ to $34.91\pm1.04$ dB. Notably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable performance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\pm0.034$, PSNR: $33.52\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust generalization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.
  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for developing generalizable models across institutions without centralized data sharing or site-specific fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renjie Xu, Chong Wu, Maolin Che, Zhuoheng Ran, Yimin Wei, Hong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose sparseGeoHOPCA, a novel framework for sparse higher-order principal component analysis (SHOPCA) that introduces a geometric perspective to high-dimensional tensor decomposition. By unfolding the input tensor along each mode and reformulating the resulting subproblems as structured binary linear optimization problems, our method transforms the original nonconvex sparse objective into a tractable geometric form. This eliminates the need for explicit covariance estimation and iterative deflation, enabling significant gains in both computational efficiency and interpretability, particularly in high-dimensional and unbalanced data scenarios. We theoretically establish the equivalence between the geometric subproblems and the original SHOPCA formulation, and derive worst-case approximation error bounds based on classical PCA residuals, providing data-dependent performance guarantees. The proposed algorithm achieves a total computational complexity of $O\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} (k_n^3 + J_n k_n^2)\right)$, which scales linearly with tensor size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sparseGeoHOPCA accurately recovers sparse supports in synthetic settings, preserves classification performance under 10$\times$ compression, and achieves high-quality image reconstruction on ImageNet, highlighting its robustness and versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hee Suk Yoon, Eunseop Yoon, Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson, Sungwoong Kim, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators, raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple, lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better alignment with zero additional computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not faithfully reflect true distances between clusters, practitioners frequently use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. In this paper, we bring this issue to the surface and comprehensively investigate why such misuse occurs and how to prevent it. We conduct a literature review of 114 papers to verify the prevalence of the misuse and analyze the reasonings behind it. We then execute an interview study to uncover practitioners' implicit motivations for using these techniques -- rationales often undisclosed in the literature. Our findings indicate that misuse of t-SNE and UMAP primarily stems from limited discourse on their appropriate use in visual analytics. We conclude by proposing future directions and concrete action items to promote more reasonable use of DR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nelvin Tan, Yu-Ching Shih, Dong Yang, Amol Salunkhe</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are being increasingly used to automate decisions in almost every domain, and ensuring the performance of these models is crucial for ensuring high quality machine learning enabled services. Ensuring concept drift is detected early is thus of the highest importance. A lot of research on concept drift has focused on the supervised case that assumes the true labels of supervised tasks are available immediately after making predictions. Controlling for false positives while monitoring the performance of predictive models used to make inference from extremely large datasets periodically, where the true labels are not instantly available, becomes extremely challenging. We propose a flexible and efficient concept drift detection algorithm that uses classical statistical process control in a label-less setting to accurately detect concept drifts. We shown empirically that under computational constraints, our approach has better statistical power than previous known methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new drift detection framework to model the scenario of detecting drift (without labels) given prior detections, and show our how our drift detection algorithm can be incorporated effectively into this framework. We demonstrate promising performance via numerical simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael F\"arber, David Lamprecht, Yuni Susanti</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender systems for the Linked Open Data cloud.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Anwar, Mishca de Costa, Issam Hammad, Daniel Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook. Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations. Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing, and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktoria Patapovich, Mo Kordzanganeh, Alexey Melnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline; on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mishca de Costa, Muhammad Anwar, Dave Mercier, Mark Randall, Issam Hammad</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports. Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured -- complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved, purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach, highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in critical systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection, earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuni Susanti, Michael F\"arber</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data. However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery. Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts, improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship. Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores, evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Kammerer, Deaglan J. Bartlett, Gabriel Kronberger, Harry Desmond, Pedro G. Ferreira</p>
<p>Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys, acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes (e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in 53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and ensuring reliable insights.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3) maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danush Khanna, Krishna Kumar, Basab Ghosh, Vinija Jain, Vasu Sharma, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families. Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates (ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction. Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens into how models internally encode safety.

<p>Abstract: Despite high reliability, modern power systems with growing renewable penetration face an increasing risk of cascading outages. Real-time cascade mitigation requires fast, complex operational decisions under uncertainty. In this work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model (MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission systems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial contingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative decision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy gradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the unmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning method converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward design, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating system conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively reduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in mitigating cascade propagation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Leo Liu, Greg Durrett, Eunsol Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating knowledge to a wide range of relations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing access to high-performance AI research. https://github.com/shinandrew/YouronMath.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben Weitzman, Peter M{\o}rch Groth, Lood Van Niekerk, Aoi Otani, Yarin Gal, Debora Marks, Pascal Notin</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving homologous protein sequences is essential for a broad range of protein modeling tasks such as fitness prediction, protein design, structure modeling, and protein-protein interactions. Traditional workflows have relied on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments. However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector search. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly adapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time -- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunming He, Kai Li, Yachao Zhang, Ziyun Yang, Youwei Pang, Longxiang Tang, Chengyu Fang, Yulun Zhang, Linghe Kong, Xiu Li, Sina Farsiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance improvement on the DOTA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Ranjan, Rahul Sengupta, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28% of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marek Kadl\v{c}\'ik, Michal \v{S}tef\'anik, Timothee Mickus, Michal Spiegel, Josef Kucha\v{r}</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models' representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered by our probe can mitigate these errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Lian, Hong-Yu Zhou, Dongyun Liang, Jing Qin, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/ALTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Wagner, Pramit Saha, Harry Anthony, J. Alison Noble, Konstantinos Kamnitsas</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runqian Wang, Kaiming He</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhen Zhang, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Fan, Cen Chen, Chengyu Wang, Xiaodan Li, Wenmeng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have brought attention to the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) systems to gradient leakage attacks. Such attacks exploit clients' uploaded gradients to reconstruct their sensitive data, thereby compromising the privacy protection capability of FL. In response, various defense mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this threat by manipulating the uploaded gradients. Unfortunately, empirical evaluations have demonstrated limited resilience of these defenses against sophisticated attacks, indicating an urgent need for more effective defenses. In this paper, we explore a novel defensive paradigm that departs from conventional gradient perturbation approaches and instead focuses on the construction of robust data. Intuitively, if robust data exhibits low semantic similarity with clients' raw data, the gradients associated with robust data can effectively obfuscate attackers. To this end, we design Refiner that jointly optimizes two metrics for privacy protection and performance maintenance. The utility metric is designed to promote consistency between the gradients of key parameters associated with robust data and those derived from clients' data, thus maintaining model performance. Furthermore, the privacy metric guides the generation of robust data towards enlarging the semantic gap with clients' data. Theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of Refiner, and empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior defense effectiveness of Refiner at defending against state-of-the-art attacks.</p>

In this paper, we perform a generalization analysis of a state-of-the-art ADMM-based unfolding network, which jointly learns a decoder for CS and a sparsifying redundant analysis operator. To this end, we first impose a structural constraint on the learnable sparsifier, which parametrizes the network's hypothesis class. For the latter, we estimate its Rademacher complexity. With this estimate in hand, we deliver generalization error bounds -- which scale like the square root of the number of layers -- for the examined network. Finally, the validity of our theory is assessed and numerical comparisons to a state-of-the-art unfolding network are made, on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework complies with our theoretical findings and outperforms the baseline, consistently for all datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jade Garcia Bourr\'ee, Erwan Le Merrer, Gilles Tredan, Beno\^it Rottembourg</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent legislation requires online platforms to provide dedicated APIs to assess the compliance of their decision-making algorithms with the law. Research has nevertheless shown that the auditors of such platforms are prone to manipulation (a practice referred to as \textit{fairwashing}). To address this salient problem, recent work has considered audits under the assumption of partial knowledge of the platform's internal mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a more pragmatic approach with the \textit{Two-Source Audit} setup: while still leveraging the API, we advocate for the adjunction of a second source of data to both perform the audit of a platform and the detection of fairwashing attempts. Our method is based on identifying discrepancies between the two data sources, using data proxies at use in the fairness literature. We formally demonstrate the conditions for success in this fairwashing mitigation task. We then validate our method empirically, demonstrating that Two-Source Audits can achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between the two objectives. We believe this paper sets the stage for reliable audits in manipulation-prone setups, under mild assumptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotic systems that rely primarily on self-supervised learning have the potential to decrease the amount of human annotation and engineering effort required to learn control strategies. In the same way that prior robotic systems have leveraged self-supervised techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), our work builds on prior work showing that the reinforcement learning (RL) itself can be cast as a self-supervised problem: learning to reach any goal without human-specified rewards or labels. Despite the seeming appeal, little (if any) prior work has demonstrated how self-supervised RL methods can be practically deployed on robotic systems. By first studying a challenging simulated version of this task, we discover design decisions about architectures and hyperparameters that increase the success rate by $2 \times$. These findings lay the groundwork for our main result: we demonstrate that a self-supervised RL algorithm based on contrastive learning can solve real-world, image-based robotic manipulation tasks, with tasks being specified by a single goal image provided after training.</p>

<p>Abstract: As ML models are increasingly deployed in critical applications, robustness against adversarial perturbations is crucial. While numerous defenses have been proposed to counter such attacks, they typically assume that all adversarial transformations are equally important, an assumption that rarely aligns with real-world applications. To address this, we study the problem of robust learning against adversarial perturbations under cost-sensitive scenarios, where the potential harm of different types of misclassifications is encoded in a cost matrix. Our solution introduces a provably robust learning algorithm to certify and optimize for cost-sensitive robustness, building on the scalable certification framework of randomized smoothing. Specifically, we formalize the definition of cost-sensitive certified radius and propose our novel adaptation of the standard certification algorithm to generate tight robustness certificates tailored to any cost matrix. In addition, we design a robust training method that improves certified cost-sensitive robustness without compromising model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including challenging ones unsolvable by existing methods, demonstrate the effectiveness of our certification algorithm and training method across various cost-sensitive scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent systems (MAS), the dynamic interaction among multiple decision-makers is driven by their innate values, affecting the environment's state, and can cause specific behavioral patterns to emerge. On the other hand, innate values in cognitive modeling reflect individual interests and preferences for specific tasks and drive them to develop diverse skills and plans, satisfying their various needs and achieving common goals in cooperation. Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term. However, the current MAS reinforcement learning domain lacks a general intrinsic model to describe agents' dynamic motivation for decision-making and learning from an individual needs perspective in their cooperation. To address the gap, this paper proposes a general MAS innate-values reinforcement learning (IVRL) architecture from the individual preferences angle. We tested the Multi-Agent IVRL Actor-Critic Model in different StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) settings, which demonstrated its potential to organize the group's behaviours to achieve better performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Zhao, Yingtao Zhang, Xinghang Li, Huaping Liu, Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demands on GPU memory posed by the increasing number of neural network parameters call for training approaches that are more memory-efficient. Previous memory reduction training techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and ReLoRA, face challenges, with LoRA being constrained by its low-rank structure, particularly during intensive tasks like pre-training, and ReLoRA suffering from saddle point issues. In this paper, we propose Sparse Spectral Training (SST) to optimize memory usage for pre-training. SST updates all singular values and selectively updates singular vectors through a multinomial sampling method weighted by the magnitude of the singular values. Furthermore, SST employs singular value decomposition to initialize and periodically reinitialize low-rank parameters, reducing distortion relative to full-rank training compared to other low-rank methods. Through comprehensive testing on both Euclidean and hyperbolic neural networks across various tasks, SST demonstrates its ability to outperform existing memory reduction training methods and is comparable to full-rank training in various cases. On LLaMA-1.3B, with only 18.7\% of the parameters trainable compared to full-rank training (using a rank equivalent to 6\% of the embedding dimension), SST reduces the perplexity gap between other low-rank methods and full-rank training by 97.4\%. This result highlights SST as an effective parameter-efficient technique for model pre-training.</p>

Focusing on a standard set-valued prediction framework called conformal prediction (CP), this paper studies how to improve its practical performance using only unlabeled data from the shifted test domain. This is achieved by two new methods called ECP and EACP, whose main idea is to adjust the score function in CP according to its base model's own uncertainty evaluation. Through extensive experiments on a number of large-scale datasets and neural network architectures, we show that our methods provide consistent improvement over existing baselines and nearly match the performance of fully supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiwei Cheng, Kexin Fu, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: The Langevin Dynamics (LD), which aims to sample from a probability distribution using its score function, has been widely used for analyzing and developing score-based generative modeling algorithms. While the convergence behavior of LD in sampling from a uni-modal distribution has been extensively studied in the literature, the analysis of LD under a mixture distribution with distinct modes remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we analyze LD in sampling from a mixture distribution and theoretically study its convergence properties. Our theoretical results indicate that for general mixture distributions of sub-Gaussian components, LD could fail in finding all the components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. Following our result on the complexity of LD in sampling from high-dimensional variables, we propose Chained Langevin Dynamics (Chained-LD), which divides the data vector into patches of smaller sizes and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. Our theoretical analysis of Chained-LD indicates its faster convergence speed to the components of a mixture distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, validating our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the vanilla and chained LD algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natalie Maus, Kyurae Kim, Geoff Pleiss, David Eriksson, John P. Cunningham, Jacob R. Gardner</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian optimization (BO) tasks such as molecular design often require 10,000 function evaluations before obtaining meaningful results. While methods like sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGPs) reduce computational requirements in these settings, the underlying approximations result in suboptimal data acquisitions that slow the progress of optimization. In this paper we modify SVGPs to better align with the goals of BO: targeting informed data acquisition rather than global posterior fidelity. Using the framework of utility-calibrated variational inference, we unify GP approximation and data acquisition into a joint optimization problem, thereby ensuring optimal decisions under a limited computational budget. Our approach can be used with any decision-theoretic acquisition function and is compatible with trust region methods like TuRBO. We derive efficient joint objectives for the expected improvement and knowledge gradient acquisition functions in both the standard and batch BO settings. Our approach outperforms standard SVGPs on high-dimensional benchmark tasks in control and molecular design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licong Lin, Jingfeng Wu, Sham M. Kakade, Peter L. Bartlett, Jason D. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance.
  We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a>1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vint Lee, Minh Nguyen, Leena Elzeiny, Chun Deng, Pieter Abbeel, John Wawrzynek</p>
<p>Abstract: Macro placement is a vital step in digital circuit design that defines the physical location of large collections of components, known as macros, on a 2D chip. Because key performance metrics of the chip are determined by the placement, optimizing it is crucial. Existing learning-based methods typically fall short because of their reliance on reinforcement learning (RL), which is slow and struggles to generalize, requiring online training on each new circuit. Instead, we train a diffusion model capable of placing new circuits zero-shot, using guided sampling in lieu of RL to optimize placement quality. To enable such models to train at scale, we designed a capable yet efficient architecture for the denoising model, and propose a novel algorithm to generate large synthetic datasets for pre-training. To allow zero-shot transfer to real circuits, we empirically study the design decisions of our dataset generation algorithm, and identify several key factors enabling generalization. When trained on our synthetic data, our models generate high-quality placements on unseen, realistic circuits, achieving competitive performance on placement benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmet Zahid Balc{\i}o\u{g}lu, Newton Mwai, Emil Carlsson, Fredrik D. Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: For many decision-making tasks, such as precision medicine, historical data alone are insufficient to determine the right choice for a new problem instance or patient. Online algorithms like multi-armed bandits can find optimal personalized decisions but are notoriously sample-hungry. In practice, training a bandit for a new individual from scratch is often infeasible, as the number of trials required is larger than the practical number of decision points. Latent bandits offer rapid exploration and personalization beyond what context variables can reveal, provided that a latent variable model can be learned consistently. In this work, we propose an identifiable latent bandit framework that leads to optimal decision-making with a shorter exploration time than classical bandits by learning from historical records of decisions and outcomes. Our method is based on nonlinear independent component analysis that provably identifies representations from observational data sufficient to infer the optimal action in new bandit instances. We verify this strategy in simulated and semi-synthetic environments, showing substantial improvement over online and offline learning baselines when identifying conditions are satisfied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Bagatella, Andreas Krause, Georg Martius</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a powerful language for task specification in reinforcement learning, as it allows describing objectives beyond the expressivity of conventional discounted return formulations. Nonetheless, recent works have shown that LTL formulas can be translated into a variable rewarding and discounting scheme, whose optimization produces a policy maximizing a lower bound on the probability of formula satisfaction. However, the synthesized reward signal remains fundamentally sparse, making exploration challenging. We aim to overcome this limitation, which can prevent current algorithms from scaling beyond low-dimensional, short-horizon problems. We show how better exploration can be achieved by further leveraging the LTL specification and casting its corresponding Limit Deterministic B\"uchi Automaton (LDBA) as a Markov reward process, thus enabling a form of high-level value estimation. By taking a Bayesian perspective over LDBA dynamics and proposing a suitable prior distribution, we show that the values estimated through this procedure can be treated as a shaping potential and mapped to informative intrinsic rewards. Empirically, we demonstrate applications of our method from tabular settings to high-dimensional continuous systems, which have so far represented a significant challenge for LTL-based reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Marc M\'ezard, Emanuele Moscato, Luca Saglietti</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for data models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. By comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco N. F. Q. Simoes, Mehdi Dastani, Thijs van Ommen</p>
<p>Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct abstractions of parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artur Back de Luca, George Giapitzakis, Shenghao Yang, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c, Kimon Fountoulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a growing interest in the ability of neural networks to execute algorithmic tasks (e.g., arithmetic, summary statistics, and sorting). The goal of this work is to better understand the role of attention in Transformers for algorithmic execution. Its importance for algorithmic execution has been studied theoretically and empirically using parallel computational models. Notably, many parallel algorithms communicate between processors solely using positional information. Inspired by this observation, we investigate how Transformers can execute algorithms using positional attention, where attention weights depend exclusively on positional encodings. We prove that Transformers with positional attention (positional Transformers) maintain the same expressivity of parallel computational models, incurring a logarithmic depth cost relative to the input length. We analyze their in-distribution learnability and explore how parameter norms in positional attention affect sample complexity. Our results show that positional Transformers introduce a learning trade-off: while they exhibit better theoretical dependence on parameter norms, certain tasks may require more layers, which can, in turn, increase sample complexity. Finally, we empirically explore the out-of-distribution performance of positional Transformers and find that they perform well in tasks where their underlying algorithmic solution relies on positional information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zefang Liu, Yinzhu Quan</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are widely used to model the timing and occurrence of events in domains such as social networks, transportation systems, and e-commerce. In this paper, we introduce TPP-LLM, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TPPs to capture both the semantic and temporal aspects of event sequences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on categorical event type representations, TPP-LLM directly utilizes the textual descriptions of event types, enabling the model to capture rich semantic information embedded in the text. While LLMs excel at understanding event semantics, they are less adept at capturing temporal patterns. To address this, TPP-LLM incorporates temporal embeddings and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to effectively learn temporal dynamics without extensive retraining. This approach improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that TPP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sequence modeling and event prediction, highlighting the benefits of combining LLMs with TPPs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite advances in deep probabilistic models, learning discrete latent representations remains challenging. This work introduces a novel method to improve inference in discrete Variational Autoencoders by reframing the inference problem through a generative perspective. We conceptualize the model as a communication system, and propose to leverage Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) to introduce redundancy in latent representations, allowing the variational posterior to produce more accurate estimates and reduce the variational gap. We present a proof-of-concept using a Discrete Variational Autoencoder with binary latent variables and low-complexity repetition codes, extending it to a hierarchical structure for disentangling global and local data features. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, data reconstruction, and uncertainty calibration, outperforming the uncoded models even when trained with tighter bounds such as the Importance Weighted Autoencoder objective. We also outline the properties that ECCs should possess to be effectively utilized for improved discrete variational inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Eckmann, Dongxia Wu, Germano Heinzelmann, Michael K. Gilson, Rose Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current generative models for drug discovery primarily use molecular docking as an oracle to guide the generation of active compounds. However, such models are often not useful in practice because even compounds with high docking scores do not consistently show real-world experimental activity. More accurate methods for activity prediction exist, such as molecular dynamics based binding free energy calculations, but they are too computationally expensive to use in a generative model. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent space Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates a set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. Using active learning, we train a surrogate model for each oracle and use these surrogates to guide generation of compounds with high predicted activity. Unlike previous approaches that separately learn the surrogate model and generative model, MF-LAL combines the generative and multi-fidelity surrogate models into a single framework, allowing for more accurate activity prediction and higher quality samples. Our experiments on two disease-relevant proteins show that MF-LAL produces compounds with significantly better binding free energy scores than other single and multi-fidelity approaches (~50% improvement in mean binding free energy score).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woosung Koh, Wonbeen Oh, Siyeol Kim, Suhin Shin, Hyeongjin Kim, Jaein Jang, Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis. However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code, and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2%-7% in certain cases.

By comparing pre-trained diffusion models to their theoretically optimal empirical counterparts, we identify a shared local inductive bias across a variety of network architectures. From this observation, we hypothesize that network denoisers generalize through localized denoising operations, as these operations approximate the training objective well over much of the training distribution. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce novel denoising algorithms which aggregate local empirical denoisers to replicate network behaviour. Comparing these algorithms to network denoisers across forward and reverse diffusion processes, our approach exhibits consistent visual similarity to neural network outputs, with lower mean squared error than previously proposed methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework accounting for the shift in the data distribution induced by the prediction of a model deployed in the real world. Ensuring rapid convergence to a stable solution where the data distribution remains the same after the model deployment is crucial, especially in evolving environments. This paper extends the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) framework by utilizing historical datasets from previous retraining snapshots, yielding a class of algorithms that we call Affine Risk Minimizers and enabling convergence to a performatively stable point for a broader class of problems. We introduce a new upper bound for methods that use only the final iteration of the dataset and prove for the first time the tightness of both this new bound and the previous existing bounds within the same regime. We also prove that utilizing historical datasets can surpass the lower bound for last iterate RRM, and empirically observe faster convergence to the stable point on various performative prediction benchmarks. We offer at the same time the first lower bound analysis for RRM within the class of Affine Risk Minimizers, quantifying the potential improvements in convergence speed that could be achieved with other variants in our framework.</p>

In this work, we present a framework for dynamics generalization in deep reinforcement learning that unifies these two distinct types of generalization within a single architecture. We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate through extensive simulation and hardware locomotion experiments on a quadruped robot.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing deployment of pre-trained models like Transformers on cloud platforms, privacy concerns about model parameters and inference data are intensifying. Existing Privacy-Preserving Transformer Inference (PPTI) frameworks face the "impossible trinity" of balancing privacy, efficiency, and performance: Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)-based approaches ensure strong privacy but suffer from high computational overhead and performance losses; Conversely, permutation-based methods achieve near-plaintext efficiency and accuracy but compromise privacy by exposing sensitive model parameters and intermediate results. Bridging this gap with a single approach presents substantial challenges, motivating the introduction of CENTAUR, a groundbreaking PPTI framework that seamlessly integrates random permutations and SMPC to address the "impossible trinity". By designing efficient PPTI algorithms tailored to the structural properties of Transformer models, CENTAUR achieves an unprecedented balance among privacy, efficiency, and performance. Our experiments demonstrate CENTAUR's ability to resist diverse data reconstruction attacks, achieve plaintext-level inference accuracy, and boost inference speed by 5.0-30.4 times, unlocking new possibilities for secure and efficient AI deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linus Heck, Maximilian Gelbrecht, Michael T. Schaub, Niklas Boers</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have recently emerged as a promising approach for learning generative models from stochastic time series data. However, they systematically underestimate the noise level inherent in such data, limiting their ability to capture stochastic dynamics accurately. We investigate this underestimation in detail and propose a straightforward solution: by including an explicit additional noise regularization in the loss function, we are able to learn a model that accurately captures the diffusion component of the data. We demonstrate our results on a conceptual model system that highlights the improved latent neural SDE's capability to model stochastic bistable dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqu Liang, Haimin Hu, Ryan Liu, Thomas L. Griffiths, Jaime Fern\'andez Fisac</p>
<p>Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions--crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We validate RLHS across three consultancy settings--marketplace interactions, restaurant recommendations, and online course advising--using both online (PPO) and offline (DPO) fine-tuning methods, and show that it substantially improves alignment over RLHF in experiments and human evaluations. We perform post-hoc benchmark evaluations on TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and TrustLLM, finding that even after single-task fine-tuning, RLHF misalignment persists, whereas RLHS consistently outperforms baselines and demonstrates robust alignment generalization.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19090">Pivoting Factorization: A Compact Meta Low-Rank Representation of Sparsity for Efficient Inference in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Zhao, Yingtao Zhang, Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning struggles to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster inference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyu Feng, Yiming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a simple yet effective sampling framework for combinatorial optimization (CO). Our method builds on discrete Langevin dynamics (LD), an efficient gradient-guided generative paradigm. However, we observe that directly applying LD often leads to limited exploration. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Regularized Langevin Dynamics (RLD), which enforces an expected distance between the sampled and current solutions, effectively avoiding local minima. We develop two CO solvers on top of RLD, one based on simulated annealing (SA), and the other one based on neural network (NN). Empirical results on three classic CO problems demonstrate that both of our methods can achieve comparable or better performance against the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) SA- and NN-based solvers. In particular, our SA algorithm reduces the runtime of the previous SOTA SA method by up to 80\%, while achieving equal or superior performance. In summary, RLD offers a promising framework for enhancing both traditional heuristics and NN models to solve CO problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shengyu-Feng/RLD4CO.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce FedGVI, a probabilistic Federated Learning (FL) framework that is robust to both prior and likelihood misspecification. FedGVI addresses limitations in both frequentist and Bayesian FL by providing unbiased predictions under model misspecification, with calibrated uncertainty quantification. Our approach generalises previous FL approaches, specifically Partitioned Variational Inference (Ashman et al., 2022), by allowing robust and conjugate updates, decreasing computational complexity at the clients. We offer theoretical analysis in terms of fixed-point convergence, optimality of the cavity distribution, and provable robustness to likelihood misspecification. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FedGVI in terms of improved robustness and predictive performance on multiple synthetic and real world classification data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onur Celik, Zechu Li, Denis Blessing, Ge Li, Daniel Palenicek, Jan Peters, Georgia Chalvatzaki, Gerhard Neumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt-RL) has become the standard approach to RL due to its beneficial exploration properties. Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges-primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). \emph{DIME} leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Defilippis, Yatin Dandi, Pierre Mergny, Florent Krzakala, Bruno Loureiro</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of how many samples from a Gaussian multi-index model are required to weakly reconstruct the relevant index subspace. Despite its increasing popularity as a testbed for investigating the computational complexity of neural networks, results beyond the single-index setting remain elusive. In this work, we introduce spectral algorithms based on the linearization of a message passing scheme tailored to this problem. Our main contribution is to show that the proposed methods achieve the optimal reconstruction threshold. Leveraging a high-dimensional characterization of the algorithms, we show that above the critical threshold the leading eigenvector correlates with the relevant index subspace, a phenomenon reminiscent of the Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP) transition in spiked models arising in random matrix theory. Supported by numerical experiments and a rigorous theoretical framework, our work bridges critical gaps in the computational limits of weak learnability in multi-index model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Gopakumar, Ander Gray, Lorenzo Zanisi, Timothy Nunn, Daniel Giles, Matt J. Kusner, Stanislas Pamela, Marc Peter Deisenroth</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating complex physical systems is crucial for understanding and predicting phenomena across diverse fields, such as fluid dynamics and heat transfer, as well as plasma physics and structural mechanics. Traditional approaches rely on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using numerical methods, which are computationally expensive and often prohibitively slow for real-time applications or large-scale simulations. Neural PDEs have emerged as efficient alternatives to these costly numerical solvers, offering significant computational speed-ups. However, their lack of robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) limits deployment in critical applications. We introduce a model-agnostic, physics-informed conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides guaranteed uncertainty estimates without requiring labelled data. By utilising a physics-based approach, we can quantify and calibrate the model's inconsistencies with the physics rather than the uncertainty arising from the data. Our approach utilises convolutional layers as finite-difference stencils and leverages physics residual errors as nonconformity scores, enabling data-free UQ with marginal and joint coverage guarantees across prediction domains for a range of complex PDEs. We further validate the efficacy of our method on neural PDE models for plasma modelling and shot design in fusion reactors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulun Wu, Doron L. Bergman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an Adversarially Pre-trained Transformer (APT) that is able to perform zero-shot meta-learning on tabular prediction tasks without pre-training on any real-world dataset, extending on the recent development of Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and TabPFN. Specifically, APT is pre-trained with adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying data generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with different synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a mixture block architecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number of classes, addressing the class size limitation -- a crucial weakness of prior deep tabular zero-shot learners. In experiments, we show that our framework matches state-of-the-art performance on small classification tasks without filtering on dataset characteristics such as number of classes and number of missing values, while maintaining an average runtime under one second. On common benchmark dataset suites in both classification and regression, we show that adversarial pre-training was able to enhance TabPFN's performance. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able to generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random generator in TabPFN. In addition, we demonstrate that our mixture block neural design has improved generalizability and greatly accelerated pre-training.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06905">Lightweight Dataset Pruning without Full Training via Example Difficulty and Prediction Uncertainty</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeseul Cho, Baekrok Shin, Changmin Kang, Chulhee Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning rely heavily on massive datasets, leading to substantial storage and training costs. Dataset pruning aims to alleviate this demand by discarding redundant examples. However, many existing methods require training a model with a full dataset over a large number of epochs before being able to prune the dataset, which ironically makes the pruning process more expensive than just training the model on the entire dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL) score, which aims to identify important samples from the early training stage by considering both example difficulty and prediction uncertainty. To address a catastrophic accuracy drop at an extreme pruning, we further propose a ratio-adaptive sampling using Beta distribution. Experiments on various datasets and learning scenarios such as image classification with label noise and image corruption, and model architecture generalization demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Specifically, on ImageNet-1k, our method reduces the time cost for pruning to 66% compared to previous methods while achieving a SOTA, specifically 60% test accuracy at a 90% pruning ratio. On CIFAR datasets, the time cost is reduced to just 15% while maintaining SOTA performance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07783">Curvature Tuning: Provable Training-free Model Steering From a Single Parameter</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leyang Hu, Matteo Gamba, Randall Balestriero</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling of model and data sizes has reshaped the AI landscape, establishing finetuning pretrained models as the standard paradigm for solving downstream tasks. However, dominant finetuning methods typically rely on weight adaptation, often lack interpretability, and depend on heuristically chosen hyperparameters. In this paper, we take a different perspective and shift the focus from weights to activation functions, viewing them through the lens of spline operators. We propose Curvature Tuning (CT), an interpretable and principled steering method that modulates a model's decision boundary by injecting a single hyperparameter into its activation functions. We show that CT provably adjusts model decision boundary curvature and, more fundamentally, projects a model onto a space of smooth functions-thereby complementing current finetuning methods, whose effect lies primarily in feature adaptation. Making this hyperparameter trainable gives rise to a novel and highly parameter-efficient finetuning method. Empirically, CT improves both generalization and robustness. For example, it boosts downstream accuracy of ResNet-50/152 by 7.14%/8.46% over linear probing and 4.64%/1.70% over LoRA across 12 datasets, and improves robust accuracy on the $\ell_\infty$ benchmark from RobustBench by 1032.64%/1494.46%.

<p>Abstract: Recent work reported that simple Bayesian optimization (BO) methods perform well for high-dimensional real-world tasks, seemingly contradicting prior work and tribal knowledge. This paper investigates why. We identify underlying challenges that arise in high-dimensional BO and explain why recent methods succeed. Our empirical analysis shows that vanishing gradients caused by Gaussian process (GP) initialization schemes play a major role in the failures of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) and that methods that promote local search behaviors are better suited for the task. We find that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of GP length scales suffices for state-of-the-art performance. Based on this, we propose a simple variant of MLE called MSR that leverages these findings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a comprehensive set of real-world applications. We present targeted experiments to illustrate and confirm our findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series modeling and analysis have become critical in various domains. Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) represent a paradigm shift by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical rigor of differential equations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we address key challenges and future research directions. This survey serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage NDEs for advanced time series analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Memory is crucial for enabling agents to tackle complex tasks with temporal and spatial dependencies. While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. To address this, we introduce MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect MIKASA-Base -- a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop MIKASA-Robo (pip install mikasa-robo-suite) -- a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation. Our work introduces a unified framework to advance memory RL research, enabling more robust systems for real-world use. MIKASA is available at https://tinyurl.com/membenchrobots.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training-free guidance enables controlled generation in diffusion and flow models, but most methods rely on gradients and assume differentiable objectives. This work focuses on training-free guidance addressing challenges from non-differentiable objectives and discrete data distributions. We propose TreeG: Tree Search-Based Path Steering Guidance, applicable to both continuous and discrete settings in diffusion and flow models. TreeG offers a unified framework for training-free guidance by proposing, evaluating, and selecting candidates at each step, enhanced with tree search over active paths and parallel exploration. We comprehensively investigate the design space of TreeG over the candidate proposal module and the evaluation function, instantiating TreeG into three novel algorithms. Our experiments show that TreeG consistently outperforms top guidance baselines in symbolic music generation, small molecule design, and enhancer DNA design with improvements of 29.01%, 16.6%, and 18.43%. Additionally, we identify an inference-time scaling law showing TreeG's scalability in inference-time computation.</p>

The upper and lower bounds converge to the true cdf over its domain as the resolution increases. Our method applies to any feedforward NN using continuous monotonic piecewise twice continuously differentiable activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh and softmax) and convolutional NNs, which were beyond the scope of competing approaches. The novelty and instrumental tool of our approach is to bound general NNs with ReLU NNs. The ReLU NN-based bounds are then used to derive the upper and lower bounds of the cdf of the NN output. Experiments demonstrate that our method delivers guaranteed bounds of the predictive output distribution over its support, thus providing exact error guarantees, in contrast to competing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Guan, Abhijith Sharma, Chong Tian, Salem Lahlou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong W. Xu, Wenhao Li, Scott Sanner, Elias B. Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a Transformer-based framework for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). CSPs find use in many applications and thus accelerating their solution with machine learning is of wide interest. Most existing approaches rely on supervised learning from feasible solutions or reinforcement learning, paradigms that require either feasible solutions to these NP-Complete CSPs or large training budgets and a complex expert-designed reward signal. To address these challenges, we propose ConsFormer, a self-supervised framework that leverages a Transformer as a solution refiner. ConsFormer constructs a solution to a CSP iteratively in a process that mimics local search. Instead of using feasible solutions as labeled data, we devise differentiable approximations to the discrete constraints of a CSP to guide model training. Our model is trained to improve random assignments for a single step but is deployed iteratively at test time, circumventing the bottlenecks of supervised and reinforcement learning. Experiments on Sudoku, Graph Coloring, Nurse Rostering, and MAXCUT demonstrate that our method can tackle out-of-distribution CSPs simply through additional iterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We show that neural networks can be optimized to represent minimum energy paths as continuous functions, offering a flexible alternative to discrete path-search methods like Nudged Elastic Band (NEB). Our approach parameterizes reaction paths with a network trained on a loss function that discards tangential energy gradients and enables instant estimation of the transition state. We first validate the method on two-dimensional potentials and then demonstrate its advantages over NEB on challenging atomistic systems where (i) poor initial guesses yield unphysical paths, (ii) multiple competing paths exist, or (iii) the reaction follows a complex multi-step mechanism. Results highlight the versatility of the method: for instance, a simple adjustment to the sampling strategy during optimization can help escape local-minimum solutions. Finally, in a low-dimensional setting, we demonstrate that a single neural network can learn from existing paths and generalize to unseen systems, showing promise for a universal reaction path representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlie B. Tan, Avishek Joey Bose, Chen Lin, Leon Klein, Michael M. Bronstein, Alexander Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a long-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann generators tackle this problem by pairing normalizing flows with importance sampling to obtain uncorrelated samples under the target distribution. In this paper, we extend the Boltzmann generator framework with two key contributions, denoting our framework Sequential Boltzmann Generators (SBG). The first is a highly efficient Transformer-based normalizing flow operating directly on all-atom Cartesian coordinates. In contrast to the equivariant continuous flows of prior methods, we leverage exactly invertible non-equivariant architectures which are highly efficient during both sample generation and likelihood evaluation. This efficiency unlocks more sophisticated inference strategies beyond standard importance sampling. In particular, we perform inference-time scaling of flow samples using a continuous-time variant of sequential Monte Carlo, in which flow samples are transported towards the target distribution with annealed Langevin dynamics. SBG achieves state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. all metrics on peptide systems, demonstrating the first equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of tri-, tetra- and hexa-peptides that were thus far intractable for prior Boltzmann generators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instance selection (IS) addresses the critical challenge of reducing dataset size while keeping informative characteristics, becoming increasingly important as datasets grow to millions of instances. Current IS methods often struggle with capturing complex relationships in high-dimensional spaces and scale with large datasets. This paper introduces a graph attention-based instance selection (GAIS) method that uses attention mechanisms to identify informative instances through their structural relationships in graph representations. We present two approaches for scalable graph construction: a distance-based mini-batch sampling technique that achieves dataset-size-independent complexity through strategic batch processing, and a hierarchical hashing approach that enables efficient similarity computation through random projections. The mini-batch approach keeps class distributions through stratified sampling, while the hierarchical hashing method captures relationships at multiple granularities through single-level, multi-level, and multi-view variants. Experiments across 39 datasets show that GAIS achieves reduction rates above 96\% while maintaining or improving model performance relative to state-of-the-art IS methods. The findings show that the distance-based mini-batch approach offers an optimal efficiency for large-scale datasets, while multi-view variants excel on complex, high-dimensional data, demonstrating that attention-based importance scoring can effectively identify instances important for maintaining decision boundaries while avoiding computationally prohibitive pairwise comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Burrage, Pamela M. Burrage, Justin N. Kreikemeyer, Adelinde M. Uhrmacher, Hasitha N. Weerasinghe</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we adapt a two-species agent-based cancer model that describes the interaction between cancer cells and healthy cells on a uniform grid to include the interaction with a third species -- namely immune cells. We run six different scenarios to explore the competition between cancer and immune cells and the initial concentration of the immune cells on cancer dynamics. We then use coupled equation learning to construct a population-based reaction model for each scenario. We show how they can be unified into a single surrogate population-based reaction model, whose underlying three coupled ordinary differential equations are much easier to analyse than the original agent-based model. As an example, by finding the single steady state of the cancer concentration, we are able to find a linear relationship between this concentration and the initial concentration of the immune cells. This then enables us to estimate suitable values for the competition and initial concentration to reduce the cancer substantially without performing additional complex and expensive simulations from an agent-based stochastic model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Ding, Mingxi Lei, Shaowei Wang, Tianhang Zheng, Di Wang, Jinhui Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate one of the most fundamental nonconvex learning problems, ReLU regression, in the Differential Privacy (DP) model. Previous studies on private ReLU regression heavily rely on stringent assumptions, such as constant bounded norms for feature vectors and labels. We relax these assumptions to a more standard setting, where data can be i.i.d. sampled from $O(1)$-sub-Gaussian distributions. We first show that when $\varepsilon = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}})$ and there is some public data, it is possible to achieve an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{N^2 \varepsilon^2})$ for the excess population risk in $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, where $d$ is the dimension and $N$ is the number of data samples. Moreover, we relax the requirement of $\epsilon$ and public data by proposing and analyzing a one-pass mini-batch Generalized Linear Model Perceptron algorithm (DP-MBGLMtron). Additionally, using the tracing attack argument technique, we demonstrate that the minimax rate of the estimation error for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms is lower bounded by $\Omega(\frac{d^2}{N^2 \varepsilon^2})$. This shows that DP-MBGLMtron achieves the optimal utility bound up to logarithmic factors. Experiments further support our theoretical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meghna Roy Chowdhury, Wei Xuan, Shreyas Sen, Yixue Zhao, Yi Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental health issues among college students have reached critical levels, significantly impacting academic performance and overall wellbeing. Predicting and understanding mental health status among college students is challenging due to three main factors: the necessity for large-scale longitudinal datasets, the prevalence of black-box machine learning models lacking transparency, and the tendency of existing approaches to provide aggregated insights at the population level rather than individualized understanding.
  To tackle these challenges, this paper presents I-HOPE, the first Interpretable Hierarchical mOdel for Personalized mEntal health prediction. I-HOPE is a two-stage hierarchical model that connects raw behavioral features to mental health status through five defined behavioral categories as interaction labels. We evaluate I-HOPE on the College Experience Study, the longest longitudinal mobile sensing dataset. This dataset spans five years and captures data from both pre-pandemic periods and the COVID-19 pandemic. I-HOPE achieves a prediction accuracy of 91%, significantly surpassing the 60-70% accuracy of baseline methods. In addition, I-HOPE distills complex patterns into interpretable and individualized insights, enabling the future development of tailored interventions and improving mental health support.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Egor Zverev, Evgenii Kortukov, Alexander Panfilov, Alexandra Volkova, Soroush Tabesh, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Christoph H. Lampert</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, large language models lack elementary safety features, making them susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause of the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a new architectural element, ASIDE, that allows language models to clearly separate instructions and data at the level of embeddings. ASIDE applies an orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating clearly distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. As we demonstrate experimentally across a range of models, instruction-tuning LLMs with ASIDE (1) leads to highly increased instruction-data separation without a loss in model utility and (2) makes the models more robust to prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we provide insights into the mechanism underlying our method through an analysis of the model representations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Oh, Minchan Jeong, Jongwoo Ko, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: How well can one expect transfer learning to work in a new setting where the domain is shifted, the task is different, and the architecture changes? Many transfer learning metrics have been proposed to answer this question. But how accurate are their predictions in a realistic new setting? We conducted an extensive evaluation involving over 42,000 experiments comparing 23 transferability metrics across 16 different datasets to assess their ability to predict transfer performance. Our findings reveal that none of the existing metrics perform well across the board. However, we find that a simple k-nearest neighbor evaluation -- as is commonly used to evaluate feature quality for self-supervision -- not only surpasses existing metrics, but also offers better computational efficiency and ease of implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianren Wang, Yifan Su, Abhinav Gupta, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for their strong asymptotic performance and training stability, but they struggle to scale with larger batch sizes, as additional parallel environments yield redundant data due to limited policy-induced diversity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) scale naturally and encourage exploration via randomized population-based search, but are often sample-inefficient. We propose Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that combines the scalability and diversity of EAs with the performance and stability of policy gradients. EPO maintains a population of agents conditioned on latent variables, shares actor-critic network parameters for coherence and memory efficiency, and aggregates diverse experiences into a master agent. Across tasks in dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and classic control, EPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung-Yueh Chiang, Chi-Chih Chang, Natalia Frumkin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Diana Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms two state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00395">A Theory of Machine Understanding via the Minimum Description Length Principle</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Canlin Zhang, Xiuwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks trained through end-to-end learning have achieved remarkable success across various domains in the past decade. However, the end-to-end learning strategy, originally designed to minimize predictive loss in a black-box manner, faces two fundamental limitations: the struggle to form explainable representations in a self-supervised manner, and the inability to compress information rigorously following the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. These two limitations point to a deeper issue: an end-to-end learning model is not able to "understand" what it learns. In this paper, we establish a novel theory connecting these two limitations. We design the Spectrum VAE, a novel deep learning architecture whose minimum description length (MDL) can be rigorously evaluated. Then, we introduce the concept of latent dimension combinations, or what we term spiking patterns, and demonstrate that the observed spiking patterns should be as few as possible based on the training data in order for the Spectrum VAE to achieve the MDL. Finally, our theory demonstrates that when the MDL is achieved with respect to the given data distribution, the Spectrum VAE will naturally produce explainable latent representations of the data. In other words, explainable representations--or "understanding"--can emerge in a self-supervised manner simply by making the deep network obey the MDL principle. In our opinion, this also implies a deeper insight: To understand is to compress. At its core, our theory advocates for a shift in the training objective of deep networks: not only to minimize predictive loss, but also to minimize the description length regarding the given data. That is, a deep network should not only learn, but also understand what it learns. This work is entirely theoretical and aims to inspire future research toward self-supervised, explainable AI grounded in the MDL principle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Caradot, R\'emi Emonet, Amaury Habrard, Abdel-Rahim Mezidi, Marc Sebban</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite considerable scientific advances in numerical simulation, efficiently solving PDEs remains a complex and often expensive problem. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN) have emerged as an efficient way to learn surrogate solvers by embedding the PDE in the loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling refinements for PINNs. In this paper, leveraging a new quadrature method for approximating definite integrals, we introduce a provably accurate sampling method for collocation points based on the Hessian of the PDE residuals. Comparative experiments conducted on a set of 1D and 2D PDEs demonstrate the benefits of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Kochnev, Arash Torabi Goodarzi, Zofia Antonina Bentyn, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi, Farahnaz Akrami, Chengkai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are extensively studied for knowledge graph completion, yet their evaluation remains constrained by unrealistic benchmarks. Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world assumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples, contradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often compress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol, link prediction, operates under the unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be predicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property prediction, entity-pair ranking, and triple classification address some of these limitations, they remain underutilized. Moreover, commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect real-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are essential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance variation across domains. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of four representative KGE models on large-scale datasets FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. Our analysis reveals critical insights, including substantial performance variations between small and large datasets, both in relative rankings and absolute metrics, systematic overestimation of model capabilities when n-ary relations are binarized, and fundamental limitations in current evaluation protocols and metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

<p>Abstract: Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongding Tian, Zaid Al-Ars, Maksim Kitsak, Peter Hofstee</p>
<p>Abstract: Visualizations of the loss landscape in neural networks suggest that minima are isolated points. However, both theoretical and empirical studies indicate that it is possible to connect two different minima with a path consisting of intermediate points that also have low loss. In this study, we propose a new algorithm which investigates low-loss paths in the full parameter space, not only between two minima. Our experiments on LeNet5, ResNet18, and Compact Convolutional Transformer architectures consistently demonstrate the existence of such continuous paths in the parameter space. These results suggest that the low-loss region is a fully connected and continuous space in the parameter space. Our findings provide theoretical insight into neural network over-parameterization, highlighting that parameters collectively define a high-dimensional low-loss space, implying parameter redundancy exists only within individual models and not throughout the entire low-loss space. Additionally, our work also provides new visualization methods and opportunities to improve model generalization by exploring the low-loss space that is closer to the origin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhai Zhou, Shijie Han, Shiyang Zhang, Yuhua Zhou, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Adnan, Rohan Jain, Ekansh Sharma, Rahul Krishnan, Yani Ioannou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and ResNet50).</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Gong, Rui Xing, Zhenzhe Zheng, Fan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for machine learning (ML) model training on edge devices is escalating due to data privacy and personalized service needs. However, we observe that current on-device model training is hampered by the under-utilization of on-device data, due to low training throughput, limited storage and diverse data importance. To improve data resource utilization, we propose a two-stage data selection framework {\sf Titan} to select the most important data batch from streaming data for model training with guaranteed efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in the first stage, {\sf Titan} filters out a candidate dataset with potentially high importance in a coarse-grained manner.In the second stage of fine-grained selection, we propose a theoretically optimal data selection strategy to identify the data batch with the highest model performance improvement to current training round. To further enhance time-and-resource efficiency, {\sf Titan} leverages a pipeline to co-execute data selection and model training, and avoids resource conflicts by exploiting idle computing resources. We evaluate {\sf Titan} on real-world edge devices and three representative edge computing tasks with diverse models and data modalities. Empirical results demonstrate that {\sf Titan} achieves up to $43\%$ reduction in training time and $6.2\%$ increase in final accuracy with minor system overhead, such as data processing delay, memory footprint and energy consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harish G. Ramaswamy, L. A. Prashanth</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating and optimizing utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR) of a loss, say $(Y - \hat Y)^2$, in the context of a regression problem. Empirical risk minimization with a UBSR objective is challenging since UBSR is a non-linear function of the underlying distribution. We first derive a concentration bound for UBSR estimation using independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We then frame the UBSR optimization problem as minimization of a pseudo-linear function in the space of achievable distributions $\mathcal D$ of the loss $(Y- \hat Y)^2$. We construct a gradient oracle for the UBSR objective and a linear minimization oracle (LMO) for the set $\mathcal D$. Using these oracles, we devise a bisection-type algorithm, and establish convergence to the UBSR-optimal solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: This book offers a hands-on introduction to building and understanding federated learning (FL) systems. FL enables multiple devices -- such as smartphones, sensors, or local computers -- to collaboratively train machine learning (ML) models, while keeping their data private and local. It is a powerful solution when data cannot or should not be centralized due to privacy, regulatory, or technical reasons. The book is designed for students, engineers, and researchers who want to learn how to design scalable, privacy preserving FL systems. Our main focus is on personalization: enabling each device to train its own model while still benefiting from collaboration with relevant devices. This is achieved by leveraging similarities between (the learning tasks associated with) devices that are encoded by the weighted edges (or links) of a federated learning network (FL network). The key idea is to represent real-world FL systems as networks of devices, where nodes correspond to device and edges represent communication links and data similarities between them. The training of personalized models for these devices can be naturally framed as a distributed optimization problem. This optimization problem is referred to as generalized total variation minimization (GTVMin) and ensures that devices with similar learning tasks learn similar model parameters. Our approach is both mathematically principled and practically motivated. While we introduce some advanced ideas from optimization theory and graph-based learning, we aim to keep the book accessible. Readers are guided through the core ideas step by step, with intuitive explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Fumero, Luca Moschella, Emanuele Rodol\`a, Francesco Locatello</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space. In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold, derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i) analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii) identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emo Todorov</p>
<p>Abstract: Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients, natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state value functions rather than state-control value functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anda Tang, Yiming Dong, Yutao Zeng, zhou Xun, Zhouchen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The expanding computational costs and limited resources underscore the critical need for budgeted-iteration training, which aims to achieve optimal learning within predetermined iteration budgets. While learning rate schedules fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks, particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations. In addition, the optimal learning rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training process inefficient. In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA) schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under different constrained training budgets. First, we bridge the gap by constructing a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts for the robustness to landscape curvature variations. From this framework, we derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter \varphi that provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical connection between \varphi and the condition number, adding interpretation and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for different values of \varphi. We offer practical guidelines for its selection via theoretical analysis and empirical results. Extensive experimental results show that UBA consistently surpasses the commonly-used schedules across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g., ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wang, Mingyue Cheng, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ni Mu, Hao Hu, Xiao Hu, Yiqin Yang, Bo Xu, Qing-Shan Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses explicit reward engineering by inferring reward functions from human preference comparisons, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, humans often struggle to label a clear preference between similar segments, reducing label efficiency and limiting PbRL's real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an offline PbRL method: Contrastive LeArning for ResolvIng Ambiguous Feedback (CLARIFY), which learns a trajectory embedding space that incorporates preference information, ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced apart, thus facilitating the selection of more unambiguous queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLARIFY outperforms baselines in both non-ideal teachers and real human feedback settings. Our approach not only selects more distinguished queries but also learns meaningful trajectory embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzaneh Mahdisoltani, Saeed Mahdisoltani, Roger B. Grosse, David J. Fleet</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the internal representations and decision mechanisms of deep neural networks remains a critical open challenge. While existing interpretability methods often identify influential input regions, they may not elucidate how a model distinguishes between classes or what specific changes would transition an input from one category to another. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that visualizes the implicit path between classes by treating the network gradient as a form of infinitesimal motion. Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first decompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable Pyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space. Rather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we amplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation to expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the steerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically meaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most sensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision boundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically meaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural classifiers' internal representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gil I. Shamir, Manfred K. Warmuth</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain. Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties, however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking. Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

<p>Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but, for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a 1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet. Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions -- a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman, Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down) labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy, latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjun Yao, Haoxuan Li, Yongqiang Chen, Tongliang Liu, Le Song, Eric Xing, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyuan Shi, Canbin Huang, Fanqi Wan, Longguang Zhong, Ziyi Yang, Weizhou Shen, Xiaojun Quan, Ming Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs), distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model (PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update. This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanye Zhou, Zhaokun Wang, Kai Zhou, Hui Tang, Xiaofan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs), including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2) LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining the complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of optimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of dense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current methods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while maximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards the Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps to converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse gradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for SVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing schedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and multi-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI (Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths. Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cencheng Shen, Yuexiao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the utilization of maximum and average distance correlations for multivariate independence testing. We characterize their consistency properties in high-dimensional settings with respect to the number of marginally dependent dimensions, compare the advantages of each test statistic, examine their respective null distributions, and present a fast chi-square-based testing procedure. The resulting tests are non-parametric and applicable to both Euclidean distance and the Gaussian kernel as the underlying metric. To better understand the practical use cases of the proposed tests, we evaluate the empirical performance of the maximum distance correlation, average distance correlation, and the original distance correlation across various multivariate dependence scenarios, as well as conduct a real data experiment to test the presence of various cancer types and peptide levels in human plasma.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Yang, Hongyang R. Zhang, Sen Wu, Christopher R\'e, Weijie J. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of learning one task using samples from another task is central to transfer learning. In this paper, we focus on answering the following question: when does combining the samples from two related tasks perform better than learning with one target task alone? This question is motivated by an empirical phenomenon known as negative transfer, which has been observed in practice. While the transfer effect from one task to another depends on factors such as their sample sizes and the spectrum of their covariance matrices, precisely quantifying this dependence has remained a challenging problem. In order to compare a transfer learning estimator to single-task learning, one needs to compare the risks between the two estimators precisely. Further, the comparison depends on the distribution shifts between the two tasks. This paper applies recent developments of random matrix theory to tackle this challenge in a high-dimensional linear regression setting with two tasks. We show precise high-dimensional asymptotics for the bias and variance of a classical hard parameter sharing (HPS) estimator in the proportional limit, where the sample sizes of both tasks increase proportionally with dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics apply to various types of distribution shifts, including covariate shifts, model shifts, and combinations of both. We illustrate these results in a random-effects model to mathematically prove a phase transition from positive to negative transfer as the number of source task samples increases. One insight from the analysis is that a rebalanced HPS estimator, which downsizes the source task when the model shift is high, achieves the minimax optimal rate. The finding regarding phase transition also applies to multiple tasks when covariates are shared across tasks. Simulations validate the accuracy of the high-dimensional asymptotics for finite dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuo-Wei Lai, Vidya Muthukumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide a unified framework that applies to a general family of convex losses across binary and multiclass settings in the overparameterized regime to approximately characterize the implicit bias of gradient descent in closed form. Specifically, we show that the implicit bias is approximated (but not exactly equal to) the minimum-norm interpolation in high dimensions, which arises from training on the squared loss. In contrast to prior work, which was tailored to exponentially-tailed losses and used the intermediate support-vector-machine formulation, our framework directly builds on the primal-dual analysis of Ji and Telgarsky (2021), allowing us to provide new approximate equivalences for general convex losses through a novel sensitivity analysis. Our framework also recovers existing exact equivalence results for exponentially-tailed losses across binary and multiclass settings. Finally, we provide evidence for the tightness of our techniques and use our results to demonstrate the effect of certain loss functions designed for out-of-distribution problems on the closed-form solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Major, Aleksandar Toma\v{s}evi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Populist rhetoric employed on online media is characterized as deeply impassioned and often imbued with strong emotions. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the differences in affective nonverbal communication of political leaders. We use a deep-learning approach to process a sample of 220 YouTube videos of political leaders from 15 different countries, analyze their facial expressions of emotion and then examine differences in average emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the YouTube video. Based on a sample of manually coded images, we find that this deep-learning approach has 53-60\% agreement with human labels. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, edge computing has served as a paradigm that enables many future technologies like AI, Robotics, IoT, and high-speed wireless sensor networks (like 5G) by connecting cloud computing facilities and services to the end users. Especially in medical and healthcare applications, it provides remote patient monitoring and increases voluminous multimedia. From the robotics angle, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) is an active-assistive robotic technology in rehabilitation robotics, attracting researchers to study and benefit people with disability like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children. However, the main challenge of RAT is that the model capable of detecting the affective states of ASD people exists and can recall individual preferences. Moreover, involving expert diagnosis and recommendations to guide robots in updating the therapy approach to adapt to different statuses and scenarios is a crucial part of the ASD therapy process. This paper proposes the architecture of edge cognitive computing by combining human experts and assisted robots collaborating in the same framework to achieve a seamless remote diagnosis, round-the-clock symptom monitoring, emergency warning, therapy alteration, and advanced assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yize Sun, Zixin Wu, Yunpu Ma, Volker Tresp</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning presents new opportunities for advancing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Sadr, Tony Tohme, Kamal Youcef-Toumi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present an adjoint-based method for discovering the underlying governing partial differential equations (PDEs) given data. The idea is to consider a parameterized PDE in a general form and formulate a PDE-constrained optimization problem aimed at minimizing the error of the PDE solution from data. Using variational calculus, we obtain an evolution equation for the Lagrange multipliers (adjoint equations) allowing us to compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters of PDEs given data in a straightforward manner. In particular, we consider a family of parameterized PDEs encompassing linear, nonlinear, and spatial derivative candidate terms, and elegantly derive the corresponding adjoint equations. We show the efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying the form of the PDE up to machine accuracy, enabling the accurate discovery of PDEs from data. We also compare its performance with the famous PDE Functional Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics method known as PDE-FIND (Rudy et al., 2017), on both smooth and noisy data sets. Even though the proposed adjoint method relies on forward/backward solvers, it outperforms PDE-FIND for large data sets thanks to the analytic expressions for gradients of the cost function with respect to each PDE parameter.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04416">Multimodal Unsupervised Domain Generalization by Retrieving Across the Modality Gap</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Liao, Christian So, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Brian Kulis</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is an important problem that learns a model which generalizes to unseen test domains leveraging one or more source domains, under the assumption of shared label spaces. However, most DG methods assume access to abundant source data in the target label space, a requirement that proves overly stringent for numerous real-world applications, where acquiring the same label space as the target task is prohibitively expensive. For this setting, we tackle the multimodal version of the unsupervised domain generalization (MUDG) problem, which uses a large task-agnostic unlabeled source dataset during finetuning. Our framework does not explicitly assume any relationship between the source dataset and target task. Instead, it relies only on the premise that the source dataset can be accurately and efficiently searched in a joint vision-language space. We make three contributions in the MUDG setting. Firstly, we show theoretically that cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search suffers from low recall due to the large distance between text queries and the image centroids used for coarse quantization. Accordingly, we propose paired k-means, a simple clustering algorithm that improves nearest neighbor recall by storing centroids in query space instead of image space. Secondly, we propose an adaptive text augmentation scheme for target labels designed to improve zero-shot accuracy and diversify retrieved image data. Lastly, we present two simple but effective components to further improve downstream target accuracy. We compare against state-of-the-art name-only transfer, source-free DG and zero-shot (ZS) methods on their respective benchmarks and show consistent improvement in accuracy on 20 diverse datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Holzer, Ivica Turkalj</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a popular approach in Quantum Machine Learning.
  We analyze this frequency spectrum using the Minkowski sum for sets and the set of differences, which makes it particularly easy to express and calculate the frequency spectrum algebraically, and prove different maximality results for a large class of models.
  Furthermore, we prove that under some mild conditions there exists a bijection between classes of models with the same area $A:=R\cdot L$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A=RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we collect and extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with arbitrarily many layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, where our two introduces notions of maximality differ, we extend existing results based on the so-called Golomb ruler and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07143">Harnessing the Continuous Structure: Utilizing the First-order Approach in Online Contract Design</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiliang Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: This work studies the online contract design problem. The principal's goal is to learn the optimal contract that maximizes her utility through repeated interactions, without prior knowledge of the agent's type (i.e., the agent's cost and production functions). We leverage the structure provided by continuous action spaces, which allows the application of first-order conditions (FOC) to characterize the agent's behavior. In some cases, we utilize conditions from the first-order approach (FOA) in economics, but in certain settings, we are able to apply FOC without additional assumptions, leading to simpler and more principled algorithms.
  We illustrate this approach in three problem settings. Firstly, we study the problem of learning the optimal contract when there can be many outcomes. In contrast to prior works that design highly specialized algorithms, we show that the problem can be directly reduced to Lipschitz bandits. Secondly, we study the problem of learning linear contracts. While the contracting problem involves hidden action (moral hazard) and the pricing problem involves hidden value (adverse selection), the two problems share a similar optimization structure, which enables direct reduction between the problem of learning linear contracts and dynamic pricing. Thirdly, we study the problem of learning contracts with many outcomes when agents are identical and provide an algorithm with polynomial sample complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Du, Zhibo Wang, Jie Zhang, Xiaoyi Pang, Jiahui Hu, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to ''memorizing'' training data, including substantial sensitive user information. To mitigate privacy risks and safeguard the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising approach for enabling LMs to efficiently ''forget'' specific texts. However, despite the good intentions, is textual unlearning really as effective and reliable as expected? To address the concern, we first propose Unlearning Likelihood Ratio Attack+ (U-LiRA+), a rigorous textual unlearning auditing method, and find that unlearned texts can still be detected with very high confidence after unlearning. Further, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the privacy risks of textual unlearning mechanisms in deployment and present the Textual Unlearning Leakage Attack (TULA), along with its variants in both black- and white-box scenarios. We show that textual unlearning mechanisms could instead reveal more about the unlearned texts, exposing them to significant membership inference and data reconstruction risks. Our findings highlight that existing textual unlearning actually gives a false sense of unlearning, underscoring the need for more robust and secure unlearning mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how humans conceptualize and categorize natural objects offers critical insights into perception and cognition. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object representations from linguistic and multimodal data? In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analyses to explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable, suggesting that LLMs and MLLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA. This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to human ones, share fundamental similarities that reflect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our findings advance the understanding of machine intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aras Selvi, Eleonora Kreacic, Mohsen Ghassemi, Vamsi Potluru, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarially robust optimization (ARO) has emerged as the *de facto* standard for training models that hedge against adversarial attacks in the test stage. While these models are robust against adversarial attacks, they tend to suffer severely from overfitting. To address this issue, some successful methods replace the empirical distribution in the training stage with alternatives including *(i)* a worst-case distribution residing in an ambiguity set, resulting in a distributionally robust (DR) counterpart of ARO; *(ii)* a mixture of the empirical distribution with a distribution induced by an auxiliary (*e.g.*, synthetic, external, out-of-domain) dataset. Inspired by the former, we study the Wasserstein DR counterpart of ARO for logistic regression and show it admits a tractable convex optimization reformulation. Adopting the latter setting, we revise the DR approach by intersecting its ambiguity set with another ambiguity set built using the auxiliary dataset, which offers a significant improvement whenever the Wasserstein distance between the data generating and auxiliary distributions can be estimated. We study the underlying optimization problem, develop efficient solution algorithms, and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark approaches on standard datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aswini Kumar Patra, Ankit Varshney, Lingaraj Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung L Nguyen, Toby Dylan Hocking</p>
<p>Abstract: Changepoint detection is a technique used to identify significant shifts in sequences and is widely used in fields such as finance, genomics, and medicine. To identify the changepoints, dynamic programming (DP) algorithms, particularly Optimal Partitioning (OP) family, are widely used. To control the changepoints count, these algorithms use a fixed penalty to penalize the changepoints presence. To predict the optimal value of that penalty, existing methods used simple models such as linear or tree-based, which may limit predictive performance. To address this issue, this study proposes using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a ReLU activation function to predict the penalty. The proposed model generates continuous predictions -- as opposed to the stepwise ones in tree-based models -- and handles non-linearity better than linear models. Experiments on large benchmark genomic datasets demonstrate that the proposed model improves accuracy and F1 score compared to existing models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their parameter-intensive nature and reliance on large amounts of data for effective performance have shifted the focus from traditional human-annotated labels to unsupervised learning and pretraining strategies that uncover hidden structures within the data. In response to this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm. SSL leverages inherent relationships within the data itself as a form of supervision, eliminating the need for manual labeling and offering a more scalable and resource-efficient alternative for model training. Given these advantages, it is imperative to explore the integration of SSL techniques with ViTs, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Inspired by this evolving trend, this survey aims to systematically review SSL mechanisms tailored for ViTs. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy to classify SSL techniques based on their representations and pre-training tasks. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review prominent pre-training tasks, and highlight advancements and challenges in this field. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSL methods designed for ViTs, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neutrino telescopes detect rare interactions of particles produced in some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. This is accomplished by instrumenting a cubic-kilometer volume of naturally occurring transparent medium with light sensors. Given their substantial size and the high frequency of background interactions, these telescopes amass an enormous quantity of large variance, high-dimensional data. These attributes create substantial challenges for analyzing and reconstructing interactions, particularly when utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called om2vec, that employs transformer-based variational autoencoders to efficiently represent neutrino telescope events by learning compact and descriptive latent representations. We demonstrate that these latent representations offer enhanced flexibility and improved computational efficiency, thereby facilitating downstream tasks in data analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): a multimodal language model for videos, particularly designed to efficiently capture temporal information over multiple frames. BLIP-3-Video takes advantage of the 'temporal encoder' in addition to the conventional visual tokenizer, which maps a sequence of tokens over multiple frames into a compact set of visual tokens. This enables BLIP3-Video to use much fewer visual tokens than its competing models (e.g., 32 vs. 4608 tokens). We explore different types of temporal encoders, including learnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like Token Turing Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains video question-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models (e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by using fewer visual tokens.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xien Chen, Rit Gangopadhyay, Michael Chu, Patrick Rim, Hyoungseob Park, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose UnCLe, the first standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal 3D reconstruction task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. While unsupervised learning of depth boasts the possibility continual learning of novel data distributions over time, existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel nonstationary distributions, they ``catastrophically forget'' previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models across indoor and outdoor environments, and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Halimi Razlighi, Maximilian H. V. Tillmann, Edgar Beck, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a multi-task semantic communication (SemCom) system for distributed sources, extending the existing focus on collaborative single-task execution. We build on the cooperative multi-task processing introduced in [1], which divides the encoder into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs). While earlier studies in multi-task SemCom focused on full observation settings, our research explores a more realistic case where only distributed partial observations are available, such as in a production line monitored by multiple sensing nodes. To address this, we propose an SemCom system that supports multi-task processing through cooperation on the transmitter side via split structure and collaboration on the receiver side. We have used an information-theoretic perspective with variational approximations for our end-to-end data-driven approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative and collaborative multi-task (CCMT) SemCom system significantly improves task execution accuracy, particularly in complex datasets, if the noise introduced from the communication channel is not limiting the task performance too much. Our findings contribute to a more general SemCom framework capable of handling distributed sources and multiple tasks simultaneously, advancing the applicability of SemCom systems in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongzhen Zhao, Vivienne Wang, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aims to discover objects in images or videos by reconstructing the input. Representative methods achieve this by reconstructing the input as its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) discrete representations, which suppress (super-)pixel noise and enhance object separability. However, these methods treat features as indivisible units, overlooking their compositional attributes, and discretize features via scalar code indexes, losing attribute-level similarities and differences. We propose Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR) for OCL. For better generalization, features are decomposed into combinatorial attributes by organized channel grouping. For better convergence, features are quantized into discrete representations via tuple code indexes. Experiments demonstrate that GDR consistently improves both mainstream and state-of-the-art OCL methods across various datasets. Visualizations further highlight GDR's superior object separability and interpretability. The source code is available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/GroupedDiscreteRepresentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Innate values describe agents' intrinsic motivations, which reflect their inherent interests and preferences for pursuing goals and drive them to develop diverse skills that satisfy their various needs. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) is learning from interaction based on the feedback rewards of the environment. However, in real scenarios, the rewards are generated by agents' innate value systems, which differ vastly from individuals based on their needs and requirements. In other words, considering the AI agent as a self-organizing system, developing its awareness through balancing internal and external utilities based on its needs in different tasks is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support others and integrate community with safety and harmony in the long term. To address this gap, we propose a new RL model termed innate-values-driven RL (IVRL) based on combined motivations' models and expected utility theory to mimic its complex behaviors in the evolution through decision-making and learning. Then, we introduce two IVRL-based models: IV-DQN and IV-A2C. By comparing them with benchmark algorithms such as DQN, DDQN, A2C, and PPO in the Role-Playing Game (RPG) reinforcement learning test platform VIZDoom, we demonstrated that the IVRL-based models can help the agent rationally organize various needs, achieve better performance effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Coalson, Jeonghyun Woo, Yu Sun, Shiyang Chen, Lishan Yang, Prashant Nair, Bo Fang, Sanghyun Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new class of attacks on commercial-scale (human-aligned) language models that induce jailbreaking through targeted bitwise corruptions in model parameters. Our adversary can jailbreak billion-parameter language models with fewer than 25 bit-flips in all cases$-$and as few as 5 in some$-$using up to 40$\times$ less bit-flips than existing attacks on computer vision models at least 100$\times$ smaller. Unlike prompt-based jailbreaks, our attack renders these models in memory 'uncensored' at runtime, allowing them to generate harmful responses without any input modifications. Our attack algorithm efficiently identifies target bits to flip, offering up to 20$\times$ more computational efficiency than previous methods. This makes it practical for language models with billions of parameters. We show an end-to-end exploitation of our attack using software-induced fault injection, Rowhammer (RH). Our work examines 56 DRAM RH profiles from DDR4 and LPDDR4X devices with different RH vulnerabilities. We show that our attack can reliably induce jailbreaking in systems similar to those affected by prior bit-flip attacks. Moreover, our approach remains effective even against highly RH-secure systems (e.g., 46$\times$ more secure than previously tested systems). Our analyses further reveal that: (1) models with less post-training alignment require fewer bit flips to jailbreak; (2) certain model components, such as value projection layers, are substantially more vulnerable than others; and (3) our method is mechanistically different than existing jailbreaks. Our findings highlight a pressing, practical threat to the language model ecosystem and underscore the need for research to protect these models from bit-flip attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariel Gera, Odellia Boni, Yotam Perlitz, Roy Bar-Haim, Lilach Eden, Asaf Yehudai</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashay Athalye, Nishanth Kumar, Tom Silver, Yichao Liang, Jiuguang Wang, Tom\'as Lozano-P\'erez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling</p>
<p>Abstract: Our aim is to learn to solve long-horizon decision-making problems in complex robotics domains given low-level skills and a handful of short-horizon demonstrations containing sequences of images. To this end, we focus on learning abstract symbolic world models that facilitate zero-shot generalization to novel goals via planning. A critical component of such models is the set of symbolic predicates that define properties of and relationships between objects. In this work, we leverage pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to propose a large set of visual predicates potentially relevant for decision-making, and to evaluate those predicates directly from camera images. At training time, we pass the proposed predicates and demonstrations into an optimization-based model-learning algorithm to obtain an abstract symbolic world model that is defined in terms of a compact subset of the proposed predicates. At test time, given a novel goal in a novel setting, we use the VLM to construct a symbolic description of the current world state, and then use a search-based planning algorithm to find a sequence of low-level skills that achieves the goal. We demonstrate empirically across experiments in both simulation and the real world that our method can generalize aggressively, applying its learned world model to solve problems with a wide variety of object types, arrangements, numbers of objects, and visual backgrounds, as well as novel goals and much longer horizons than those seen at training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Refoyo, David Luengo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning systems excel in complex tasks but often lack transparency, limiting their use in critical applications. Counterfactual explanations, a core tool within eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), offer insights into model decisions by identifying minimal changes to an input to alter its predicted outcome. However, existing methods for time series data are limited by univariate assumptions, rigid constraints on modifications, or lack of validity guarantees. This paper introduces Multi-SpaCE, a multi-objective counterfactual explanation method for multivariate time series. Using non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-SpaCE balances proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and contiguity. Unlike most methods, it ensures perfect validity, supports multivariate data and provides a Pareto front of solutions, enabling flexibility to different end-user needs. Comprehensive experiments in diverse datasets demonstrate the ability of Multi-SpaCE to consistently achieve perfect validity and deliver superior performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananth Raman, Vinod Raman</p>
<p>Abstract: We continue to study the learning-theoretic foundations of generation by extending the results from Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] and Li et al. [2024] to account for noisy example streams. In the noiseless setting of Kleinberg and Mullainathan [2024] and Li et al. [2024], an adversary picks a hypothesis from a binary hypothesis class and provides a generator with a sequence of its positive examples. The goal of the generator is to eventually output new, unseen positive examples. In the noisy setting, an adversary still picks a hypothesis and a sequence of its positive examples. But, before presenting the stream to the generator, the adversary inserts a finite number of negative examples. Unaware of which examples are noisy, the goal of the generator is to still eventually output new, unseen positive examples. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when a binary hypothesis class can be noisily generatable. We provide such conditions with respect to various constraints on the number of distinct examples that need to be seen before perfect generation of positive examples. Interestingly, for finite and countable classes we show that generatability is largely unaffected by the presence of a finite number of noisy examples.</p>

However, in the smart manufacturing domain, there is still not too much research involved in dynamic adaptive control mechanisms optimizing complex processes. This research advances the integration of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with digital twins for industrial robotics applications, providing a framework for enhanced adaptive real-time control for smart additive manufacturing processing. The system architecture combines Unity's simulation environment with ROS2 for seamless digital twin synchronization, while leveraging transfer learning to efficiently adapt trained models across tasks. We demonstrate our methodology using a Viper X300s robot arm with the proposed hierarchical reward structure to address the common reinforcement learning challenges in two distinct control scenarios. The results show rapid policy convergence and robust task execution in both simulated and physical environments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Kova\v{c}evi\'c, Yihan Zhang, Marco Mondelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-index models provide a popular framework to investigate the learnability of functions with low-dimensional structure and, also due to their connections with neural networks, they have been object of recent intensive study. In this paper, we focus on recovering the subspace spanned by the signals via spectral estimators -- a family of methods routinely used in practice, often as a warm-start for iterative algorithms. Our main technical contribution is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral methods, when sample size and input dimension grow proportionally and the dimension $p$ of the space to recover is fixed. Specifically, we locate the top-$p$ eigenvalues of the spectral matrix and establish the overlaps between the corresponding eigenvectors (which give the spectral estimators) and a basis of the signal subspace. Our analysis unveils a phase transition phenomenon in which, as the sample complexity grows, eigenvalues escape from the bulk of the spectrum and, when that happens, eigenvectors recover directions of the desired subspace. The precise characterization we put forward enables the optimization of the data preprocessing, thus allowing to identify the spectral estimator that requires the minimal sample size for weak recovery.</p>

Recent approaches align the representation spaces of images and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper, we introduce the use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals to images. We hypothesize that these models more effectively capture perceptual attributes associated with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly used in visual brain data recording experiments. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating that this simple modification improves image retrieval accuracy by up to 21% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Clemente, Zied Ben Houidi, Alexis Huet, Dario Rossi, Giulio Franzese, Pietro Michiardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Through systematic empirical investigation, we uncover a fundamental and concerning property of Large Language Models: while they can safely learn facts that don't contradict their knowledge, attempting to update facts with contradictory information triggers catastrophic corruption of unrelated knowledge. Unlike humans, who naturally resist contradictory information, these models indiscriminately accept contradictions, leading to devastating interference, destroying up to 80% of unrelated knowledge even when learning as few as 10-100 contradicting facts. To understand whether this interference could be mitigated through selective plasticity, we experiment with targeted network updates, distinguishing between previously used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. We uncover another asymmetry: while sparing frequently-used neurons significantly improves retention of existing knowledge for non-contradictory updates (98% vs 93% with standard updates), contradictory updates trigger catastrophic interference regardless of targeting strategy. This effect which persists across tested model scales (GPT-2 to GPT-J-6B), suggests a fundamental limitation in how neural networks handle contradictions. Finally, we demonstrate that contradictory information can be reliably detected (95%+ accuracy) using simple model features, offering a potential protective mechanism. These findings motivate new architectures that can, like humans, naturally resist contradictions rather than allowing destructive overwrites.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johnny Xi, Hugh Dance, Peter Orbanz, Benjamin Bloem-Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Bivariate structural causal models (SCM) are often used to infer causal direction by examining their goodness-of-fit under restricted model classes. In this paper, we describe a parametrization of bivariate SCMs in terms of a causal velocity by viewing the cause variable as time in a dynamical system. The velocity implicitly defines counterfactual curves via the solution of initial value problems where the observation specifies the initial condition. Using tools from measure transport, we obtain a unique correspondence between SCMs and the score function of the generated distribution via its causal velocity. Based on this, we derive an objective function that directly regresses the velocity against the score function, the latter of which can be estimated non-parametrically from observational data. We use this to develop a method for bivariate causal discovery that extends beyond known model classes such as additive or location scale noise, and that requires no assumptions on the noise distributions. When the score is estimated well, the objective is also useful for detecting model non-identifiability and misspecification. We present positive results in simulation and benchmark experiments where many existing methods fail, and perform ablation studies to examine the method's sensitivity to accurate score estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Timor, Jonathan Mamou, Daniel Korat, Moshe Berchansky, Gaurav Jain, Oren Pereg, Moshe Wasserblat, David Harel</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) methods offer substantial efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens using a single target forward pass. However, existing SD approaches require the drafter and target models to share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the pool of possible drafters, often necessitating the training of a drafter from scratch. We present three new SD methods that remove this shared-vocabulary constraint. All three methods preserve the target distribution (i.e., they are lossless) and work with off-the-shelf models without requiring additional training or modifications. Empirically, on summarization, programming, and long-context tasks, our algorithms demonstrate significant speedups of up to 2.8x over standard autoregressive decoding. By enabling any off-the-shelf model to serve as a drafter and requiring no retraining, this work substantially broadens the applicability of the SD framework in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luben M. C. Cabezas, Vagner S. Santos, Thiago R. Ramos, Rafael Izbicki</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction methods create prediction bands with distribution-free guarantees but do not explicitly capture epistemic uncertainty, which can lead to overconfident predictions in data-sparse regions. Although recent conformal scores have been developed to address this limitation, they are typically designed for specific tasks, such as regression or quantile regression. Moreover, they rely on particular modeling choices for epistemic uncertainty, restricting their applicability. We introduce $\texttt{EPICSCORE}$, a model-agnostic approach that enhances any conformal score by explicitly integrating epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging Bayesian techniques such as Gaussian Processes, Monte Carlo Dropout, or Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, $\texttt{EPICSCORE}$ adaptively expands predictive intervals in regions with limited data while maintaining compact intervals where data is abundant. As with any conformal method, it preserves finite-sample marginal coverage. Additionally, it also achieves asymptotic conditional coverage. Experiments demonstrate its good performance compared to existing methods. Designed for compatibility with any Bayesian model, but equipped with distribution-free guarantees, $\texttt{EPICSCORE}$ provides a general-purpose framework for uncertainty quantification in prediction problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaesik Yoon, Hyeonseo Cho, Doojin Baek, Yoshua Bengio, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navid Rajabi, Jana Kosecka</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps on the complex R2R-Habitat instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime Maldonado, Jonas Krumme, Christoph Zetzsche, Vanessa Didelez, Kerstin Schill</p>
<p>Abstract: In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yatin Dandi, Luca Pesce, Lenka Zdeborov\'a, Florent Krzakala</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the advantages of deep neural networks trained by gradient descent (GD) compared to shallow models remains an open theoretical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a class of target functions (single and multi-index Gaussian hierarchical targets) that incorporate a hierarchy of latent subspace dimensionalities. This framework enables us to analytically study the learning dynamics and generalization performance of deep networks compared to shallow ones in the high-dimensional limit. Specifically, our main theorem shows that feature learning with GD successively reduces the effective dimensionality, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a sequence of lower-dimensional ones. This enables learning the target function with drastically less samples than with shallow networks. While the results are proven in a controlled training setting, we also discuss more common training procedures and argue that they learn through the same mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Zhai, Connor Lawless, Ellen Vitercik, Liu Leqi</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization is identifying equivalent formulations. Despite the growing need for automated equivalence checks -- driven, for example, by optimization copilots, which generate problem formulations from natural language descriptions -- current approaches rely on simple heuristics that fail to reliably check formulation equivalence. Inspired by Karp reductions, in this work we introduce Quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal criterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent based on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We propose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to automatically discover such mappings for scalable, reliable equivalence checking, with a verification stage that ensures mapped solutions preserve feasibility and optimality without additional solver calls. To evaluate our approach, we construct EquivaFormulation, the first open-source dataset of equivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations such as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations. Empirically, EquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial improvements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tergel Munkhbat, Namgyu Ho, Seo Hyun Kim, Yongjin Yang, Yujin Kim, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to utilize additional computation through intermediate tokens to solve complex tasks. However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niccol\`o Turcato, Matteo Iovino, Aris Synodinos, Alberto Dalla Libera, Ruggero Carli, Pietro Falco</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex Human-Informed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate CCR evaluation for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Qiu, Yi-Chen Li, Xuqin Zhang, Tianyi Zhang, Yihang Zhang, Zongzhang Zhang, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning reward models from human preference datasets and subsequently optimizing language models via reinforcement learning has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for aligning LLMs with human preferences. The performance of the reward model plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of alignment. Previous reward models operate at a coarse-grained level, requiring the generation of a complete response to obtain a reward value. The sparse reward may present challenges for downstream reinforcement learning. While recent efforts have attempted to learn token-level reward models, the lack of explicit semantic information makes it difficult to model the credit of every individual token. In this paper, we propose assigning scores to every sentence, introducing an intermediate-grained reward model. By segmenting the complete response into sentences and applying differential operations to reward output at the start and end positions of each sentence, we can effectively model the rewards of sentences. Moreover, a novel attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate the scores of all sentences into a response-level score, which allows it to be trained using the Bradley-Terry model. On common benchmarks, our method outperforms the response-level reward model by 2.7% on RewardBench (for reward modeling evaluation) and surpasses all baselines on AlpacaEval (for alignment evaluation).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ewan R. S. Wallace, Nathan C. Frey, Joshua A. Rackers</p>
<p>Abstract: Ligand strain energy, the energy difference between the bound and unbound conformations of a ligand, is an important component of structure-based small molecule drug design. A large majority of observed ligands in protein-small molecule co-crystal structures bind in low-strain conformations, making strain energy a useful filter for structure-based drug design. In this work we present a tool for calculating ligand strain with a high accuracy. StrainRelief uses a MACE Neural Network Potential (NNP), trained on a large database of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to estimate ligand strain of neutral molecules with quantum accuracy. We show that this tool estimates strain energy differences relative to DFT to within 1.4 kcal/mol, more accurately than alternative NNPs. These results highlight the utility of NNPs in drug discovery, and provide a useful tool for drug discovery teams.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlang Huang, Hao Chen, Li Luo, Yong Cai, Lexin Zhang, Tianhao Ma, Yitian Zhang, Zhong Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model combining Transformer and CNN for predicting the current waveform in signal lines. Unlike traditional approaches such as current source models, driver linear representations, waveform functional fitting, or equivalent load capacitance methods, our model does not rely on fixed simplified models of standard-cell drivers or RC loads. Instead, it replaces the complex Newton iteration process used in traditional SPICE simulations, leveraging the powerful sequence modeling capabilities of the Transformer framework to directly predict current responses without iterative solving steps. The hybrid architecture effectively integrates the global feature-capturing ability of Transformers with the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs, significantly improving the accuracy of current waveform predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional SPICE simulations, the proposed algorithm achieves an error of only 0.0098. These results highlight the algorithm's superior capabilities in predicting signal line current waveforms, timing analysis, and power evaluation, making it suitable for a wide range of technology nodes, from 40nm to 3nm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Jain, Rampi Ramprasad</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect conformational diversity. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with three evaluation metrics as optimization targets. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing model selection first is preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing according to RAG pipeline order.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hybrid precoding is a key ingredient of cost-effective massive multiple-input multiple-output transceivers. However, setting jointly digital and analog precoders to optimally serve multiple users is a difficult optimization problem. Moreover, it relies heavily on precise knowledge of the channels, which is difficult to obtain, especially when considering realistic systems comprising hardware impairments. In this paper, a joint channel estimation and hybrid precoding method is proposed, which consists in an end-to-end architecture taking received pilots as inputs and outputting pre-coders. The resulting neural network is fully model-based, making it lightweight and interpretable with very few learnable parameters. The channel estimation step is performed using the unfolded matching pursuit algorithm, accounting for imperfect knowledge of the antenna system, while the precoding step is done via unfolded projected gradient ascent. The great potential of the proposed method is empirically demonstrated on realistic synthetic channels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of probability distributions from time-dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases like diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a non-parametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. Simulation studies show that our method matches or surpasses the estimation accuracy of state-of-the-art, less interpretable techniques such as normalizing flows and non-parametric kernel density estimators. We further demonstrate its utility using data from a digital clinical trial, revealing how interventions affect the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels. The proposed method enables rigorous comparisons between control and treatment groups from both mathematical and clinical perspectives, offering novel longitudinal characterizations that existing approaches cannot achieve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhou, Jing Zhu, Shengyi Qian, Zhuokai Zhao, Xiyao Wang, Xiaoyu Liu, Ming Li, Paiheng Xu, Wei Ai, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subrata Biswas, Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan, Bashima Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Van Elst, Igor Colin, Stephan Cl\'emen\c{c}on</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized, relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank estimation and an $\mathcal{O}((\log t)/\sqrt{t})$ rate for trimmed mean estimation, where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data distributions and contamination schemes.</p>

Recently, a few studies have sought to overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images, leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kidist Amde Mekonnen, Yosef Worku Alemneh, Maarten de Rijke</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhai Zhang, Zeng You, Yaofo Chen, Zhiquan Wen, Qianyue Wang, Zhijie Qiu, Yuanqing Li, Mingkui Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is available at https://github.com/bolixinyu/DynamicGroupAttention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Wenwu Li, Chuyun Shen, Junjie Sheng, Zixiao Huang, Di Wu, Yun Hua, Wei Yin, Xiangfeng Wang, Hongyuan Zha, Bo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elmira Mirzabeigi, Rezvan Salehi, Kourosh Parand</p>
<p>Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keinichi Fujita, Shota Horiguchi, Yusuke Ijima</p>
<p>Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization. Audio examples are available on our demo page (https://ntt-hilab-gensp.github.io/is2025voiceimpression/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Zhou, Weiran Liao, Xi Huang, Yucheng Tang, Fabian Otto, Xiaogang Jia, Xinkai Jiang, Simon Hilber, Ge Li, Qian Wang, \"Omer Erdin\c{c} Ya\u{g}murlu, Nils Blank, Moritz Reuss, Rudolf Lioutikov</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Shen, Ruihai Wu, Yubin Ke, Xinyuan Song, Zeyi Li, Xiaoqi Li, Hongwei Fan, Haoran Lu, Hao dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping, assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/biassembly/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations. While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses -- always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side "AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking; and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyi Li, Matvey Skripkin, Alexander Zubrey, Andrey Kuznetsov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC), which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 16 samples per question and 10 or 20 training steps, RLSC improves accuracy by +13.4% on AIME2024, +21.2% on MATH500, +21.7% on Minerva Math, +20.8% on Olympiadbench, and +9.7% on AMC23. RLSC provides a simple, scalable post-training method for inference models, requiring only a small number of samples and unlabelled supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Wen Soi, Chaoyi Zhu, Fouad Abiad, Aditya Shankar, Jeroen M. Galjaard, Huijuan Wang, Lydia Y. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5 datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanjun Chen, I-Ming Lin, Lin Zhang, Haibin Wu, Hung-yi Lee, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech (CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network (SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dane Williamson, Yangfeng Ji, Matthew Dwyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets, suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prarabdh Shukla, Wei Yin Chong, Yash Patel, Brennan Schaffner, Danish Pruthi, Arjun Bhagoji</p>
<p>Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence, relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool ($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over $107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism, ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$. Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal, revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$ blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such systems to understand context effectively.</p>
