<p><b>Authors:</b> Tinghao Xie, Xiangyu Qi, Yi Zeng, Yangsibo Huang, Udari Madhushani Sehwag, Kaixuan Huang, Luxi He, Boyi Wei, Dacheng Li, Ying Sheng, Ruoxi Jia, Bo Li, Kai Li, Danqi Chen, Peter Henderson, Prateek Mittal</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating aligned large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize and reject unsafe user requests is crucial for safe, policy-compliant deployments. Existing evaluation efforts, however, face three limitations that we address with SORRY-Bench, our proposed benchmark. First, existing methods often use coarse-grained taxonomies of unsafe topics, and are over-representing some fine-grained topics. For example, among the ten existing datasets that we evaluated, tests for refusals of self-harm instructions are over 3x less represented than tests for fraudulent activities. SORRY-Bench improves on this by using a fine-grained taxonomy of 45 potentially unsafe topics, and 450 class-balanced unsafe instructions, compiled through human-in-the-loop methods. Second, linguistic characteristics and formatting of prompts are often overlooked, like different languages, dialects, and more -- which are only implicitly considered in many evaluations. We supplement SORRY-Bench with 20 diverse linguistic augmentations to systematically examine these effects. Third, existing evaluations rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for evaluation, which can be computationally expensive. We investigate design choices for creating a fast, accurate automated safety evaluator. By collecting 7K+ human annotations and conducting a meta-evaluation of diverse LLM-as-a-judge designs, we show that fine-tuned 7B LLMs can achieve accuracy comparable to GPT-4 scale LLMs, with lower computational cost. Putting these together, we evaluate over 40 proprietary and open-source LLMs on SORRY-Bench, analyzing their distinctive refusal behaviors. We hope our effort provides a building block for systematic evaluations of LLMs' safety refusal capabilities, in a balanced, granular, and efficient manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yile Liang, Jiuxia Zhao, Donghui Li, Jie Feng, Chen Zhang, Xuetao Ding, Jinghua Hao, Renqing He</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent past has witnessed a notable surge in on-demand food delivery (OFD) services, offering delivery fulfillment within dozens of minutes after an order is placed. In OFD, pooling multiple orders for simultaneous delivery in real-time order assignment is a pivotal efficiency source, which may in turn extend delivery time. Constructing high-quality order pooling to harmonize platform efficiency with the experiences of consumers and couriers, is crucial to OFD platforms. However, the complexity and real-time nature of order assignment, making extensive calculations impractical, significantly limit the potential for order consolidation. Moreover, offline environment is frequently riddled with unknown factors, posing challenges for the platform's perceptibility and pooling decisions. Nevertheless, delivery behaviors of skilled couriers (SCs) who know the environment well, can improve system awareness and effectively inform decisions. Hence a SC delivery network (SCDN) is constructed, based on an enhanced attributed heterogeneous network embedding approach tailored for OFD. It aims to extract features from rich temporal and spatial information, and uncover the latent potential for order combinations embedded within SC trajectories. Accordingly, the vast search space of order assignment can be effectively pruned through scalable similarity calculations of low-dimensional vectors, making comprehensive and high-quality pooling outcomes more easily identified in real time. SCDN has now been deployed in Meituan dispatch system. Online tests reveal that with SCDN, the pooling quality and extent have been greatly improved. And our system can boost couriers'efficiency by 45-55% during noon peak hours, while upholding the timely delivery commitment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murali Karthick Baskar, Andrew Rosenberg, Bhuvana Ramabhadran, Neeraj Gaur, Zhong Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on addressing the constraints faced when applying LLMs to ASR. Recent works utilize prefixLM-type models, which directly apply speech as a prefix to LLMs for ASR. We have found that optimizing speech prefixes leads to better ASR performance and propose applying RNNT loss to perform speech prefix-tuning. This is a simple approach and does not increase the model complexity or alter the inference pipeline. We also propose language-based soft prompting to further improve with frozen LLMs. Empirical analysis on realtime testset from 10 Indic languages demonstrate that our proposed speech prefix-tuning yields improvements with both frozen and fine-tuned LLMs. Our recognition results on an average of 10 Indics show that the proposed prefix-tuning with RNNT loss results in a 12\% relative improvement in WER over the baseline with a fine-tuned LLM. Our proposed approches with the frozen LLM leads to a 31\% relative improvement over basic soft-prompting prefixLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirabel Reid, Santosh S. Vempala</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) perform (and sometimes excel at) more and more complex cognitive tasks, a natural question is whether AI really understands. The study of understanding in LLMs is in its infancy, and the community has yet to incorporate well-trodden research in philosophy, psychology, and education. We initiate this, specifically focusing on understanding algorithms, and propose a hierarchy of levels of understanding. We use the hierarchy to design and conduct a study with human subjects (undergraduate and graduate students) as well as large language models (generations of GPT), revealing interesting similarities and differences. We expect that our rigorous criteria will be useful to keep track of AI's progress in such cognitive domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huitong Pan, Qi Zhang, Cornelia Caragea, Eduard Dragut, Longin Jan Latecki</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SciDMT, an enhanced and expanded corpus for scientific mention detection, offering a significant advancement over existing related resources. SciDMT contains annotated scientific documents for datasets (D), methods (M), and tasks (T). The corpus consists of two components: 1) the SciDMT main corpus, which includes 48 thousand scientific articles with over 1.8 million weakly annotated mention annotations in the format of in-text span, and 2) an evaluation set, which comprises 100 scientific articles manually annotated for evaluation purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SciDMT is the largest corpus for scientific entity mention detection. The corpus's scale and diversity are instrumental in developing and refining models for tasks such as indexing scientific papers, enhancing information retrieval, and improving the accessibility of scientific knowledge. We demonstrate the corpus's utility through experiments with advanced deep learning architectures like SciBERT and GPT-3.5. Our findings establish performance baselines and highlight unresolved challenges in scientific mention detection. SciDMT serves as a robust benchmark for the research community, encouraging the development of innovative models to further the field of scientific information extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed I. Munzir, Daniel B. Hier, Chelsea Oommen, Michael D. Carrithers</p>
<p>Abstract: High-throughput phenotyping, the automated mapping of patient signs and symptoms to standardized ontology concepts, is essential to gaining value from electronic health records (EHR) in the support of precision medicine. Despite technological advances, high-throughput phenotyping remains a challenge. This study compares three computational approaches to high-throughput phenotyping: a Large Language Model (LLM) incorporating generative AI, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach utilizing deep learning for span categorization, and a hybrid approach combining word vectors with machine learning. The approach that implemented GPT-4 (a Large Language Model) demonstrated superior performance, suggesting that Large Language Models are poised to be the preferred method for high-throughput phenotyping of physician notes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bill Marino, Preslav Aleksandrov, Carwyn Rahman, Yulu Pi, Bill Shen, Rui-jie Yew, Nicholas D. Lane</p>
<p>Abstract: As the artificial intelligence (AI) supply chain grows more complex, AI systems and models are increasingly likely to incorporate externally-sourced ingredients such as datasets and other models. In such cases, determining whether or not an AI system or model complies with the EU AI Act will require gathering compliance-related metadata about both the AI system or model at-large as well as those externally-supplied ingredients. There must then be an analysis that looks across all of this metadata to render a prediction about the compliance of the overall AI system or model. Up until now, this process has not been automated. Thus, it has not been possible to make real-time compliance determinations in scenarios where doing so would be advantageous, such as the iterative workflows of today's AI developers, search and acquisition of AI ingredients on communities like Hugging Face, federated and continuous learning, and more. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a highly automated system for AI Act compliance analysis. This system has two key elements. First is an interlocking set of computational artifacts that capture compliance-related metadata about both: (1) the AI system or model at-large; (2) any constituent ingredients such as datasets and models. Second is an automated analysis algorithm that operates across those computational artifacts to render a run-time prediction about whether or not the overall AI system or model complies with the AI Act. Working together, these elements promise to enhance and accelerate AI Act compliance assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven A. Lehr, Aylin Caliskan, Suneragiri Liyanage, Mahzarin R. Banaji</p>
<p>Abstract: How good a research scientist is ChatGPT? We systematically probed the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across four central components of the scientific process: as a Research Librarian, Research Ethicist, Data Generator, and Novel Data Predictor, using psychological science as a testing field. In Study 1 (Research Librarian), unlike human researchers, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 hallucinated, authoritatively generating fictional references 36.0% and 5.4% of the time, respectively, although GPT-4 exhibited an evolving capacity to acknowledge its fictions. In Study 2 (Research Ethicist), GPT-4 (though not GPT-3.5) proved capable of detecting violations like p-hacking in fictional research protocols, correcting 88.6% of blatantly presented issues, and 72.6% of subtly presented issues. In Study 3 (Data Generator), both models consistently replicated patterns of cultural bias previously discovered in large language corpora, indicating that ChatGPT can simulate known results, an antecedent to usefulness for both data generation and skills like hypothesis generation. Contrastingly, in Study 4 (Novel Data Predictor), neither model was successful at predicting new results absent in their training data, and neither appeared to leverage substantially new information when predicting more versus less novel outcomes. Together, these results suggest that GPT is a flawed but rapidly improving librarian, a decent research ethicist already, capable of data generation in simple domains with known characteristics but poor at predicting novel patterns of empirical data to aid future experimentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Zaphir, Jason M. Lodge, Jacinta Lisec, Dom McGrath, Hassan Khosravi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI such as those with large language models have created opportunities for innovative assessment design practices. Due to recent technological developments, there is a need to know the limits and capabilities of generative AI in terms of simulating cognitive skills. Assessing student critical thinking skills has been a feature of assessment for time immemorial, but the demands of digital assessment create unique challenges for equity, academic integrity and assessment authorship. Educators need a framework for determining their assessments vulnerability to generative AI to inform assessment design practices. This paper presents a framework that explores the capabilities of the LLM ChatGPT4 application, which is the current industry benchmark. This paper presents the Mapping of questions, AI vulnerability testing, Grading, Evaluation (MAGE) framework to methodically critique their assessments within their own disciplinary contexts. This critique will provide specific and targeted indications of their questions vulnerabilities in terms of the critical thinking skills. This can go on to form the basis of assessment design for their tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos N\'u\~nez-Molina, Juan Fern\'andez-Olivares, Ra\'ul P\'erez</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we propose a planning and acting architecture endowed with a module which learns to select subgoals with Deep Q-Learning. This allows us to decrease the load of a planner when faced with scenarios with real-time restrictions. We have trained this architecture on a video game environment used as a standard test-bed for intelligent systems applications, testing it on different levels of the same game to evaluate its generalization abilities. We have measured the performance of our approach as more training data is made available, as well as compared it with both a state-of-the-art, classical planner and the standard Deep Q-Learning algorithm. The results obtained show our model performs better than the alternative methods considered, when both plan quality (plan length) and time requirements are taken into account. On the one hand, it is more sample-efficient than standard Deep Q-Learning, and it is able to generalize better across levels. On the other hand, it reduces problem-solving time when compared with a state-of-the-art automated planner, at the expense of obtaining plans with only 9% more actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dung Ngoc Thai, Victor Ardulov, Jose Ulises Mena, Simran Tiwari, Gleb Erofeev, Ramy Eskander, Karim Tarabishy, Ravi B Parikh, Wael Salloum</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying patient cohorts is fundamental to numerous healthcare tasks, including clinical trial recruitment and retrospective studies. Current cohort retrieval methods in healthcare organizations rely on automated queries of structured data combined with manual curation, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often yield low-quality results. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and information retrieval (IR) offer promising avenues to revolutionize these systems. Major challenges include managing extensive eligibility criteria and handling the longitudinal nature of unstructured Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) while ensuring that the solution remains cost-effective for real-world application. This paper introduces a new task, Automatic Cohort Retrieval (ACR), and evaluates the performance of LLMs and commercial, domain-specific neuro-symbolic approaches. We provide a benchmark task, a query dataset, an EMR dataset, and an evaluation framework. Our findings underscore the necessity for efficient, high-quality ACR systems capable of longitudinal reasoning across extensive patient databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Li, Sichao Li, Geoff Hinchcliffe, Noam Maitless, Nick Birbilis</p>
<p>Abstract: The determination of space layout is one of the primary activities in the schematic design stage of an architectural project. The initial layout planning defines the shape, dimension, and circulation pattern of internal spaces; which can also affect performance and cost of the construction. When carried out manually, space layout planning can be complicated, repetitive and time consuming. In this work, a generative design framework for the automatic generation of spatial architectural layout has been developed. The proposed approach integrates a novel physics-inspired parametric model for space layout planning and an evolutionary optimisation metaheuristic. Results revealed that such a generative design framework can generate a wide variety of design suggestions at the schematic design stage, applicable to complex design problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: While previous studies have demonstrated the potential of AI to diagnose diseases in imaging data, clinical implementation is still lagging behind. This is partly because AI models require training with large numbers of examples only available for common diseases. In clinical reality, however, only few diseases are common, whereas the majority of diseases are less frequent (long-tail distribution). Current AI models overlook or misclassify these diseases. We propose a deep anomaly detection approach that only requires training data from common diseases to detect also all less frequent diseases. We collected two large real-world datasets of gastrointestinal biopsies, which are prototypical of the problem. Herein, the ten most common findings account for approximately 90% of cases, whereas the remaining 10% contained 56 disease entities, including many cancers. 17 million histological images from 5,423 cases were used for training and evaluation. Without any specific training for the diseases, our best-performing model reliably detected a broad spectrum of infrequent ("anomalous") pathologies with 95.0% (stomach) and 91.0% (colon) AUROC and generalized across scanners and hospitals. By design, the proposed anomaly detection can be expected to detect any pathological alteration in the diagnostic tail of gastrointestinal biopsies, including rare primary or metastatic cancers. This study establishes the first effective clinical application of AI-based anomaly detection in histopathology that can flag anomalous cases, facilitate case prioritization, reduce missed diagnoses and enhance the general safety of AI models, thereby driving AI adoption and automation in routine diagnostics and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to develop and gain widespread application, the ability of LLMs to exhibit empathy towards diverse group identities and understand their perspectives is increasingly recognized as critical. Most existing benchmarks for empathy evaluation of LLMs focus primarily on universal human emotions, such as sadness and pain, often overlooking the context of individuals' group identities. To address this gap, we introduce GIEBench, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 11 identity dimensions, covering 97 group identities with a total of 999 single-choice questions related to specific group identities. GIEBench is designed to evaluate the empathy of LLMs when presented with specific group identities such as gender, age, occupation, and race, emphasizing their ability to respond from the standpoint of the identified group. This supports the ongoing development of empathetic LLM applications tailored to users with different identities. Our evaluation of 23 LLMs revealed that while these LLMs understand different identity standpoints, they fail to consistently exhibit equal empathy across these identities without explicit instructions to adopt those perspectives. This highlights the need for improved alignment of LLMs with diverse values to better accommodate the multifaceted nature of human identities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melvin Wong, Jiao Liu, Thiago Rios, Stefan Menzel, Yew Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid research and development of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the generation of high-quality images, text, and 3D models from text prompts. This advancement impels an inquiry into whether these models can be leveraged to create digital artifacts for both creative and engineering applications. Drawing on innovative designs from other domains may be one answer to this question, much like the historical practice of ``bionics", where humans have sought inspiration from nature's exemplary designs. This raises the intriguing possibility of using generative models to simultaneously tackle design tasks across multiple domains, facilitating cross-domain learning and resulting in a series of innovative design solutions. In this paper, we propose LLM2FEA as the first attempt to discover novel designs in generative models by transferring knowledge across multiple domains. By utilizing a multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) to drive a large language model, LLM2FEA integrates knowledge from various fields to generate prompts that guide the generative model in discovering novel and practical objects. Experimental results in the context of 3D aerodynamic design verify the discovery capabilities of the proposed LLM2FEA. The designs generated by LLM2FEA not only satisfy practicality requirements to a certain degree but also feature novel and aesthetically pleasing shapes, demonstrating the potential applications of LLM2FEA in discovery tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Chenxi Wang, Yifei Wang, Zihao Xie, Rennai Qiu, Yufan Dang, Zhuoyun Du, Weize Chen, Cheng Yang, Chen Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have achieved great progress in solving complex tasks. It performs communication among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' communication is leveraged to enhance human cooperation, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication towards effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shan Cong, Zhoujie Fan, Hongwei Liu, Yinghan Zhang, Xin Wang, Haoran Luo, Xiaohui Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain transcriptomics provides insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the brain coordinates its functions and processes. However, existing multimodal methods for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily rely on imaging and sometimes genetic data, often neglecting the transcriptomic basis of brain. Furthermore, while striving to integrate complementary information between modalities, most studies overlook the informativeness disparities between modalities. Here, we propose TMM, a trusted multiview multimodal graph attention framework for AD diagnosis, using extensive brain-wide transcriptomics and imaging data. First, we construct view-specific brain regional co-function networks (RRIs) from transcriptomics and multimodal radiomics data to incorporate interaction information from both biomolecular and imaging perspectives. Next, we apply graph attention (GAT) processing to each RRI network to produce graph embeddings and employ cross-modal attention to fuse transcriptomics-derived embedding with each imagingderived embedding. Finally, a novel true-false-harmonized class probability (TFCP) strategy is designed to assess and adaptively adjust the prediction confidence of each modality for AD diagnosis. We evaluate TMM using the AHBA database with brain-wide transcriptomics data and the ADNI database with three imaging modalities (AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM-MRI). The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in identifying AD, EMCI, and LMCI compared to state-of-the-arts. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yaolab-fantastic/TMM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being employed in high-stakes decisions that impact both individuals and society at large, often without adequate safeguards to ensure safety, quality, and equity. Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are biased - shortcomings that may reflect LLMs' inherent limitations and thus may not be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human feedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is therefore problematic. Here we present a hybrid collective intelligence system that mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human experience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to open-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by physicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133 medical cases. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs outperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single LLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties and professional experience, and can be attributed to humans' and LLMs' complementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors. Our approach highlights the potential for collective human and machine intelligence to improve accuracy in complex, open-ended domains like medical diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Mondal, Ljiljana Dolamic, G\'er\^ome Bovet, Philippe Cudr\'e-Mauroux</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting and Multiple Choices Questions (MCQ) have become the preferred approach to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), due to their ease of manipulation and evaluation. Such experimental appraisals have pointed toward the LLMs' apparent ability to perform causal reasoning or to grasp uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate whether these abilities are measurable outside of tailored prompting and MCQ by reformulating these issues as direct text completion - the foundation of LLMs. To achieve this goal, we define scenarios with multiple possible outcomes and we compare the prediction made by the LLM through prompting (their Stated Answer) to the probability distributions they compute over these outcomes during next token prediction (their Revealed Belief). Our findings suggest that the Revealed Belief of LLMs significantly differs from their Stated Answer and hint at multiple biases and misrepresentations that their beliefs may yield in many scenarios and outcomes. As text completion is at the core of LLMs, these results suggest that common evaluation methods may only provide a partial picture and that more research is needed to assess the extent and nature of their capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Berto, Chuanbo Hua, Nayeli Gast Zepeda, Andr\'e Hottung, Niels Wouda, Leon Lan, Kevin Tierney, Jinkyoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are optimization problems with significant real-world implications in logistics, transportation, and supply chain management. Despite the recent progress made in learning to solve individual VRP variants, there is a lack of a unified approach that can effectively tackle a wide range of tasks, which is crucial for real-world impact. This paper introduces RouteFinder, a framework for developing foundation models for VRPs. Our key idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to model variants by treating each variant as a subset of a larger VRP problem, equipped with different attributes. We introduce a parallelized environment that can handle any combination of attributes at the same time in a batched manner, and an efficient sampling procedure to train on a mix of problems at each optimization step that can greatly improve convergence robustness. We also introduce novel Global Feature Embeddings that project instance-wise attributes efficiently onto the latent space and help the model understand different VRP variants. Finally, we introduce Efficient Adapter Layers, a simple yet effective technique to finetune pre-trained RouteFinder models to solve novel variants with previously unseen attributes outside of the original feature space. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 24 VRP variants, demonstrating competitive results over recent multi-task learning models. We make our code openly available at https://github.com/ai4co/routefinder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carmel Baharav, Bailey Flanigan</p>
<p>Abstract: Sortition, the random selection of political representatives, is increasingly being used around the world to choose participants of deliberative processes like Citizens' Assemblies. Motivated by sortition's practical importance, there has been a recent flurry of research on sortition algorithms, whose task it is to select a panel from among a pool of volunteers. This panel must satisfy quotas enforcing representation of key population subgroups. Past work has contributed an algorithmic approach for fulfilling this task while ensuring that volunteers' chances of selection are maximally equal, as measured by any convex equality objective. The question, then, is: which equality objective is the right one? Past work has mainly studied the objectives Minimax and Leximin, which respectively minimize the maximum and maximize the minimum chance of selection given to any volunteer. Recent work showed that both of these objectives have key weaknesses: Minimax is highly robust to manipulation but is arbitrarily unfair; oppositely, Leximin is highly fair but arbitrarily manipulable.
  In light of this gap, we propose a new equality objective, Goldilocks, that aims to achieve these ideals simultaneously by ensuring that no volunteer receives too little or too much chance of selection. We theoretically bound the extent to which Goldilocks achieves these ideals, finding that in an important sense, Goldilocks recovers among the best available solutions in a given instance. We then extend our bounds to the case where the output of Goldilocks is transformed to achieve a third goal, Transparency. Our empirical analysis of Goldilocks in real data is even more promising: we find that this objective achieves nearly instance-optimal minimum and maximum selection probabilities simultaneously in most real instances -- an outcome not even guaranteed to be possible for any algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahan Chen, Shuhan Qi, Yifan Li, Zeyu Dong, Mingfeng Ding, Yulin Wu, Xuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Databases are fundamental to contemporary information systems, yet traditional rule-based configuration methods struggle to manage the complexity of real-world applications with hundreds of tunable parameters. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which combines perception and decision-making, presents a potential solution for intelligent database configuration tuning. However, due to black-box property of RL-based method, the generated database tuning strategies still face the urgent problem of lack explainability. Besides, the redundant parameters in large scale database always make the strategy learning become unstable. This paper proposes KnobTree, an interpertable framework designed for the optimization of database parameter configuration. In this framework, an interpertable database tuning algorithm based on RL-based differentatial tree is proposed, which building a transparent tree-based model to generate explainable database tuning strategies. To address the problem of large-scale parameters, We also introduce a explainable method for parameter importance assessment, by utilizing Shapley Values to identify parameters that have significant impacts on database performance. Experiments conducted on MySQL and Gbase8s databases have verified exceptional transparency and interpretability of the KnobTree model. The good property makes generated strategies can offer practical guidance to algorithm designers and database administrators. Moreover, our approach also slightly outperforms the existing RL-based tuning algorithms in aspects such as throughput, latency, and processing time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teo Guichoux, Laure Soulier, Nicolas Obin, Catherine Pelachaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-speech gestures play a crucial role in the interactions between humans and embodied conversational agents (ECA). Recent deep learning methods enable the generation of realistic, natural co-speech gestures synchronized with speech, but such approaches require large amounts of training data. "In-the-wild" datasets, which compile videos from sources such as YouTube through human pose detection models, offer a solution by providing 2D skeleton sequences that are paired with speech. Concurrently, innovative lifting models have emerged, capable of transforming these 2D pose sequences into their 3D counterparts, leading to large and diverse datasets of 3D gestures. However, the derived 3D pose estimation is essentially a pseudo-ground truth, with the actual ground truth being the 2D motion data. This distinction raises questions about the impact of gesture representation dimensionality on the quality of generated motions, a topic that, to our knowledge, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the dimensionality of the training data, 2D or 3D joint coordinates, on the performance of a multimodal speech-to-gesture deep generative model. We use a lifting model to convert 2D-generated sequences of body pose to 3D. Then, we compare the sequence of gestures generated directly in 3D to the gestures generated in 2D and lifted to 3D as post-processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interpretability is a key requirement for the use of machine learning models in high-stakes applications, including medical diagnosis. Explaining black-box models mostly relies on post-hoc methods that do not faithfully reflect the model's behavior. As a remedy, prototype-based networks have been proposed, but their interpretability is limited as they have been shown to provide coarse, unreliable, and imprecise explanations. In this work, we introduce Proto-BagNets, an interpretable-by-design prototype-based model that combines the advantages of bag-of-local feature models and prototype learning to provide meaningful, coherent, and relevant prototypical parts needed for accurate and interpretable image classification tasks. We evaluated the Proto-BagNet for drusen detection on publicly available retinal OCT data. The Proto-BagNet performed comparably to the state-of-the-art interpretable and non-interpretable models while providing faithful, accurate, and clinically meaningful local and global explanations.

<p>Abstract: The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has improved Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaborating with external data, yet significant challenges exist in real-world scenarios. In areas such as academic literature and finance question answering, data are often found in raw text and tables in HTML or PDF formats, which can be lengthy and highly unstructured. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark suite, namely Unstructured Document Analysis (UDA), that involves 2,965 real-world documents and 29,590 expert-annotated Q&A pairs. We revisit popular LLM- and RAG-based solutions for document analysis and evaluate the design choices and answer qualities across multiple document domains and diverse query types. Our evaluation yields interesting findings and highlights the importance of data parsing and retrieval. We hope our benchmark can shed light and better serve real-world document analysis applications. The benchmark suite and code can be found at https://github.com/qinchuanhui/UDA-Benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning and quality of life. Occupational therapy plays a crucial role in managing ADHD by fostering the development of skills needed for daily living and enhancing an individual's ability to participate fully in school, home, and social situations. Recent studies highlight the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) to improve psychological treatments. This integration aims to overcome existing limitations in mental health therapy by providing tailored support and adapting to the unique needs of this sensitive group. However, there remains a significant gap in research exploring the combined use of these advanced technologies in ADHD therapy, suggesting an opportunity for novel therapeutic approaches.
  Thus, we integrated two advanced language models, ChatGPT-4 Turbo and Claude-3 Opus, into a robotic assistant to explore how well each model performs in robot-assisted interactions. Additionally, we have compared their performance in a simulated therapy scenario to gauge their effectiveness against a clinically validated customized model. The results of this study show that ChatGPT-4 Turbo excelled in performance and responsiveness, making it suitable for time-sensitive applications. Claude-3 Opus, on the other hand, showed strengths in understanding, coherence, and ethical considerations, prioritizing safe and engaging interactions. Both models demonstrated innovation and adaptability, but ChatGPT-4 Turbo offered greater ease of integration and broader language support. The selection between them hinges on the specific demands of ADHD therapy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) services with 5G connectivity is an emerging field with numerous applications. Operator-controlled UAV flights and manual static flight configurations are major limitations for the wide adoption of scalability of UAV services. Several services depend on excellent UAV connectivity with a cellular network and maintaining it is challenging in predetermined flight paths. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for UAV path planning with assured connectivity (DUPAC). During UAV flight, DUPAC determines the best route from a defined source to the destination in terms of distance and signal quality. The viability and performance of DUPAC are evaluated under simulated real-world urban scenarios using the Unity framework. The results confirm that DUPAC achieves an autonomous UAV flight path similar to base method with only 2% increment while maintaining an average 9% better connection quality throughout the flight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lynn Vonderhaar, Timothy Elvira, Tyler Procko, Omar Ochoa</p>
<p>Abstract: Countless domains rely on Machine Learning (ML) models, including safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving, which this paper focuses on. While the black box nature of ML is simply a nuisance in some domains, in safety-critical domains, this makes ML models difficult to trust. To fully utilize ML models in safety-critical domains, it would be beneficial to have a method to improve trust in model robustness and accuracy without human experts checking each decision. This research proposes a method to increase trust in ML models used in safety-critical domains by ensuring the robustness and completeness of the model's training dataset. Because ML models embody what they are trained with, ensuring the completeness of training datasets can help to increase the trust in the training of ML models. To this end, this paper proposes the use of a domain ontology and an image quality characteristic ontology to validate the domain completeness and image quality robustness of a training dataset. This research also presents an experiment as a proof of concept for this method, where ontologies are built for the emergency road vehicle domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) becomes increasingly integrated into various facets of human life, ensuring the safety and ethical alignment of such systems is paramount. Previous studies primarily focus on single-modality threats, which may not suffice given the integrated and complex nature of cross-modality interactions. We introduce a novel safety alignment challenge called Safe Inputs but Unsafe Output (SIUO) to evaluate cross-modality safety alignment. Specifically, it considers cases where single modalities are safe independently but could potentially lead to unsafe or unethical outputs when combined. To empirically investigate this problem, we developed the SIUO, a cross-modality benchmark encompassing 9 critical safety domains, such as self-harm, illegal activities, and privacy violations. Our findings reveal substantial safety vulnerabilities in both closed- and open-source LVLMs, such as GPT-4V and LLaVA, underscoring the inadequacy of current models to reliably interpret and respond to complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research in Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmarks has explored the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in retrieving contextual information from large text documents. However, as LLMs become increasingly integrated into software development processes, it is crucial to evaluate their performance in code-based environments. As LLMs are further developed for program synthesis, we need to ensure that LLMs can understand syntax and write syntactically correct code. As a step in ensuring LLMs understand syntax, LLMs can be evaluated in their ability to find and detect syntax bugs. Our benchmark, Bug In The Code Stack (BICS), is designed to assess the ability of LLMs to identify simple syntax bugs within large source code. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) code-based environments pose significantly more challenge compared to text-based environments for retrieval tasks, (2) there is a substantial performance disparity among different models, and (3) there is a notable correlation between longer context lengths and performance degradation, though the extent of this degradation varies between models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoling Li, Xin Zhang, Xiao Liu, Yeyun Gong, Yifan Wang, Yujiu Yang, Qi Chen, Peng Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized lots of fields of research. Although it is well-known that fine-tuning is essential for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs, existing research suggests that there is potential redundancy in the fine-tuning process and therefore proposes to update only a subset of parameters. However, these methods fail to leverage the task-specific information to identify important parameters during training. Based on the insight that gradients inherently contain information on task-specific data, we propose Gradient-Mask Tuning (GMT), a method that selectively updates parameters during training based on their gradient information. Specifically, we compute the absolute values of the gradients and apply masking to those with relatively smaller magnitudes. Our empirical results across various tasks demonstrate that GMT not only outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods but also elevates the upper limits of LLM performance. Further analysis indicates that GMT exhibits insensitivity to mask ratio and possesses computational efficiency comparable to vanilla SFT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroaki Chiba-Okabe, Weijie J. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While some studies explore methods to mitigate copyright risks by steering the outputs of generative models away from those resembling copyrighted data, little attention has been paid to the question of how much of a resemblance is undesirable; more original or unique data are afforded stronger protection, and the threshold level of resemblance for constituting infringement correspondingly lower. Here, leveraging this principle, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be practically estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular data have been extensively used in different knowledge domains. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many applications where important information about data is embedded in the order of features (images), outperforming predictive results of traditional models. Recently, several researchers have proposed transforming tabular data into images to leverage the potential of CNNs and obtain high results in predictive tasks such as classification and regression. In this paper, we present a novel and effective approach for transforming tabular data into images, addressing the inherent limitations associated with low-dimensional and mixed-type datasets. Our method, named Low Mixed-Image Generator for Tabular Data (LM-IGTD), integrates a stochastic feature generation process and a modified version of the IGTD. We introduce an automatic and interpretable end-to-end pipeline, enabling the creation of images from tabular data. A mapping between original features and the generated images is established, and post hoc interpretability methods are employed to identify crucial areas of these images, enhancing interpretability for predictive tasks. An extensive evaluation of the tabular-to-image generation approach proposed on 12 low-dimensional and mixed-type datasets, including binary and multi-class classification scenarios. In particular, our method outperformed all traditional ML models trained on tabular data in five out of twelve datasets when using images generated with LM-IGTD and CNN. In the remaining datasets, LM-IGTD images and CNN consistently surpassed three out of four traditional ML models, achieving similar results to the fourth model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Luis Ponton, Eduard Pujol, Andreas Aristidou, Carlos Andujar, Nuria Pelechano</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality motion reconstruction that follows the user's movements can be achieved by high-end mocap systems with many sensors. However, obtaining such animation quality with fewer input devices is gaining popularity as it brings mocap closer to the general public. The main challenges include the loss of end-effector accuracy in learning-based approaches, or the lack of naturalness and smoothness in IK-based solutions. In addition, such systems are often finely tuned to a specific number of trackers and are highly sensitive to missing data e.g., in scenarios where a sensor is occluded or malfunctions. In response to these challenges, we introduce DragPoser, a novel deep-learning-based motion reconstruction system that accurately represents hard and dynamic on-the-fly constraints, attaining real-time high end-effectors position accuracy. This is achieved through a pose optimization process within a structured latent space. Our system requires only one-time training on a large human motion dataset, and then constraints can be dynamically defined as losses, while the pose is iteratively refined by computing the gradients of these losses within the latent space. To further enhance our approach, we incorporate a Temporal Predictor network, which employs a Transformer architecture to directly encode temporality within the latent space. This network ensures the pose optimization is confined to the manifold of valid poses and also leverages past pose data to predict temporally coherent poses. Results demonstrate that DragPoser surpasses both IK-based and the latest data-driven methods in achieving precise end-effector positioning, while it produces natural poses and temporally coherent motion. In addition, our system showcases robustness against on-the-fly constraint modifications, and exhibits exceptional adaptability to various input configurations and changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Seppi, Philippe C. Cattin</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's mechanical tools for bone cutting (osteotomy) cause mechanical trauma that prolongs the healing process. Medical device manufacturers aim to minimize this trauma, with minimally invasive surgery using laser cutting as one innovation. This method ablates tissue using laser light instead of mechanical tools, reducing post-surgery healing time. A reliable feedback system is crucial during laser surgery to prevent damage to surrounding tissues. We propose a tissue classification method analyzing acoustic waves generated during laser ablation, demonstrating its applicability in an ex-vivo experiment. The ablation process with a microsecond pulsed Er:YAG laser produces acoustic waves, acquired with an air-coupled transducer. These waves were used to classify five porcine tissue types: hard bone, soft bone, muscle, fat, and skin. For automated tissue classification, we compared five Neural Network (NN) approaches: a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with time-dependent input, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FcNN) with either the frequency spectrum or principal components of the frequency spectrum as input, and a combination of a CNN and an FcNN with time-dependent data and its frequency spectrum as input. Consecutive acoustic waves were used to improve classification accuracy. Grad-Cam identified the activation map of the frequencies, showing low frequencies as the most important for this task. Our results indicated that combining time-dependent data with its frequency spectrum achieved the highest classification accuracy (65.5%-75.5%). We also found that using the frequency spectrum alone was sufficient, with no additional benefit from applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjae Lee, Hyeseong Kim, Minsoo Rhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training recommendation systems (RecSys) faces several challenges as it requires the "data preprocessing" stage to preprocess an ample amount of raw data and feed them to the GPU for training in a seamless manner. To sustain high training throughput, state-of-the-art solutions reserve a large fleet of CPU servers for preprocessing which incurs substantial deployment cost and power consumption. Our characterization reveals that prior CPU-centric preprocessing is bottlenecked on feature generation and feature normalization operations as it fails to reap out the abundant inter-/intra-feature parallelism in RecSys preprocessing. PreSto is a storage-centric preprocessing system leveraging In-Storage Processing (ISP), which offloads the bottlenecked preprocessing operations to our ISP units. We show that PreSto outperforms the baseline CPU-centric system with a $9.6\times$ speedup in end-to-end preprocessing time, $4.3\times$ enhancement in cost-efficiency, and $11.3\times$ improvement in energyefficiency on average for production-scale RecSys preprocessing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent successes in virtual screening have been made possible by large models and extensive chemical libraries. However, combining these elements is challenging: the larger the model, the more expensive it is to run, making ultra-large libraries unfeasible. To address this, we developed a target-agnostic, efficacy-based molecule search model, which allows us to find structurally dissimilar molecules with similar biological activities. We used the best practices to design fast retrieval system, based on processor-optimized SIMD instructions, enabling us to screen the ultra-large 40B Enamine REAL library with 100\% recall rate. We extensively benchmarked our model and several state-of-the-art models for both speed performance and retrieval quality of novel molecules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anas El Fathi, Elliott Pryor, Marc D. Breton</p>
<p>Abstract: Calculating mealtime insulin doses poses a significant challenge for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Doses should perfectly compensate for expected post-meal glucose excursions, requiring a profound understanding of the individual's insulin sensitivity and the meal macronutrients'. Usually, people rely on intuition and experience to develop this understanding. In this work, we demonstrate how a reinforcement learning agent, employing a self-attention encoder network, can effectively mimic and enhance this intuitive process. Trained on 80 virtual subjects from the FDA-approved UVA/Padova T1D adult cohort and tested on twenty, self-attention demonstrates superior performance compared to other network architectures. Results reveal a significant reduction in glycemic risk, from 16.5 to 9.6 in scenarios using sensor-augmented pump and from 9.1 to 6.7 in scenarios using automated insulin delivery. This new paradigm bypasses conventional therapy parameters, offering the potential to simplify treatment and promising improved quality of life and glycemic outcomes for people with T1D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Jones, Anca Dragan, Jacob Steinhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Developers try to evaluate whether an AI system can be misused by adversaries before releasing it; for example, they might test whether a model enables cyberoffense, user manipulation, or bioterrorism. In this work, we show that individually testing models for misuse is inadequate; adversaries can misuse combinations of models even when each individual model is safe. The adversary accomplishes this by first decomposing tasks into subtasks, then solving each subtask with the best-suited model. For example, an adversary might solve challenging-but-benign subtasks with an aligned frontier model, and easy-but-malicious subtasks with a weaker misaligned model. We study two decomposition methods: manual decomposition where a human identifies a natural decomposition of a task, and automated decomposition where a weak model generates benign tasks for a frontier model to solve, then uses the solutions in-context to solve the original task. Using these decompositions, we empirically show that adversaries can create vulnerable code, explicit images, python scripts for hacking, and manipulative tweets at much higher rates with combinations of models than either individual model. Our work suggests that even perfectly-aligned frontier systems can enable misuse without ever producing malicious outputs, and that red-teaming efforts should extend beyond single models in isolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Sarch, Lawrence Jang, Michael J. Tarr, William W. Cohen, Kenneth Marino, Katerina Fragkiadaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefei Ning, Zifu Wang, Shiyao Li, Zinan Lin, Peiran Yao, Tianyu Fu, Matthew B. Blaschko, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching to improve student models (e.g., knowledge distillation) is an extensively studied methodology in LLMs. However, for humans, teaching not only improves students but also improves teachers. We ask: Can LLMs also learn by teaching (LbT)? If yes, we can potentially unlock the possibility of continuously advancing the models without solely relying on human-produced data or stronger models. In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration of this ambitious agenda. We show that LbT ideas can be incorporated into existing LLM training/prompting pipelines and provide noticeable improvements. Specifically, we design three methods, each mimicking one of the three levels of LbT in humans: observing students' feedback, learning from the feedback, and learning iteratively, with the goals of improving answer accuracy without training and improving models' inherent capability with fine-tuning. The findings are encouraging. For example, similar to LbT in human, we see that: (1) LbT can induce weak-to-strong generalization: strong models can improve themselves by teaching other weak models; (2) Diversity in students might help: teaching multiple students could be better than teaching one student or the teacher itself. We hope that this early promise can inspire future research on LbT and more broadly adopting the advanced techniques in education to improve LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/imagination-research/lbt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacques Cloete, Wolfgang Merkt, Ioannis Havoutis</p>
<p>Abstract: Many manipulation tasks use instances of a set of common motions, such as a twisting motion for tightening or loosening a valve. However, different instances of the same motion often require different environmental parameters (e.g. force/torque level), and thus different manipulation strategies to successfully complete; for example, grasping a valve handle from the side rather than head-on to increase applied torque. Humans can intuitively adapt their manipulation strategy to best suit such problems, but representing and implementing such behaviors for robots remains an open question. We present a behavior tree-based approach for adaptive manipulation, wherein the robot can reactively select from and switch between a discrete set of manipulation strategies during task execution. Furthermore, our approach allows the robot to learn from past attempts to optimize performance, for example learning the optimal strategy for different task instances. Our approach also allows the robot to preempt task failure and either change to a more feasible strategy or safely exit the task before catastrophic failure occurs. We propose a simple behavior tree design for general adaptive robot behavior and apply it in the context of industrial manipulation. The adaptive behavior outperformed all baseline behaviors that only used a single manipulation strategy, markedly reducing the number of attempts and overall time taken to complete the example tasks. Our results demonstrate potential for improved robustness and efficiency in task completion, reducing dependency on human supervision and intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minqian Liu, Zhiyang Xu, Zihao Lin, Trevor Ashby, Joy Rimchala, Jiaxin Zhang, Lifu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interleaved text-and-image generation has been an intriguing research direction, where the models are required to generate both images and text pieces in an arbitrary order. Despite the emerging advancements in interleaved generation, the progress in its evaluation still significantly lags behind. Existing evaluation benchmarks do not support arbitrarily interleaved images and text for both inputs and outputs, and they only cover a limited number of domains and use cases. Also, current works predominantly use similarity-based metrics which fall short in assessing the quality in open-ended scenarios. To this end, we introduce InterleavedBench, the first benchmark carefully curated for the evaluation of interleaved text-and-image generation. InterleavedBench features a rich array of tasks to cover diverse real-world use cases. In addition, we present InterleavedEval, a strong reference-free metric powered by GPT-4o to deliver accurate and explainable evaluation. We carefully define five essential evaluation aspects for InterleavedEval, including text quality, perceptual quality, image coherence, text-image coherence, and helpfulness, to ensure a comprehensive and fine-grained assessment. Through extensive experiments and rigorous human evaluation, we show that our benchmark and metric can effectively evaluate the existing models with a strong correlation with human judgments surpassing previous reference-based metrics. We also provide substantial findings and insights to foster future research in interleaved generation and its evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assistive robots have attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance the quality of life for vulnerable individuals like the elderly. The convergence of computer vision, large language models, and robotics has introduced the `visuolinguomotor' mode for assistive robots, where visuals and linguistics are incorporated into assistive robots to enable proactive and interactive assistance. This raises the question: \textit{In circumstances where visuals become unreliable or unavailable, can we rely solely on language to control robots, i.e., the viability of the `linguomotor` mode for assistive robots?} This work takes the initial steps to answer this question by: 1) evaluating the responses of assistive robots to language prompts of varying granularities; and 2) exploring the necessity and feasibility of controlling the robot on-the-fly. We have designed and conducted experiments on a Sawyer cobot to support our arguments. A Turtlebot robot case is designed to demonstrate the adaptation of the solution to scenarios where assistive robots need to maneuver to assist. Codes will be released on GitHub soon to benefit the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: The limited generalization of coreference resolution (CR) models has been a major bottleneck in the task's broad application. Prior work has identified annotation differences, especially for mention detection, as one of the main reasons for the generalization gap and proposed using additional annotated target domain data. Rather than relying on this additional annotation, we propose an alternative formulation of the CR task, Major Entity Identification (MEI), where we: (a) assume the target entities to be specified in the input, and (b) limit the task to only the frequent entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MEI models generalize well across domains on multiple datasets with supervised models and LLM-based few-shot prompting. Additionally, the MEI task fits the classification framework, which enables the use of classification-based metrics that are more robust than the current CR metrics. Finally, MEI is also of practical use as it allows a user to search for all mentions of a particular entity or a group of entities of interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enabling robots to autonomously perform hybrid motions in diverse environments can be beneficial for long-horizon tasks such as material handling, household chores, and work assistance. This requires extensive exploitation of intrinsic motion capabilities, extraction of affordances from rich environmental information, and planning of physical interaction behaviors. Despite recent progress has demonstrated impressive humanoid whole-body control abilities, they struggle to achieve versatility and adaptability for new tasks. In this work, we propose HYPERmotion, a framework that learns, selects and plans behaviors based on tasks in different scenarios. We combine reinforcement learning with whole-body optimization to generate motion for 38 actuated joints and create a motion library to store the learned skills. We apply the planning and reasoning features of the large language models (LLMs) to complex loco-manipulation tasks, constructing a hierarchical task graph that comprises a series of primitive behaviors to bridge lower-level execution with higher-level planning. By leveraging the interaction of distilled spatial geometry and 2D observation with a visual language model (VLM) to ground knowledge into a robotic morphology selector to choose appropriate actions in single- or dual-arm, legged or wheeled locomotion. Experiments in simulation and real-world show that learned motions can efficiently adapt to new tasks, demonstrating high autonomy from free-text commands in unstructured scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atula Tejaswi, Nilesh Gupta, Eunsol Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), their performance on a vast majority of languages remain unsatisfactory. In this paper, we study building language-specific LLMs by adapting monolingual and multilingual LLMs. We conduct systematic experiments on how design choices (base model selection, vocabulary extension, and continued fine-tuning) impact the adapted LLM, both in terms of efficiency (how many tokens are needed to encode the same amount of information) and end task performance. We find that (1) the initial performance before the adaptation is not always indicative of the final performance. (2) Efficiency can easily improved with simple vocabulary extension and continued fine-tuning in most LLMs we study, and (3) The optimal adaptation method is highly language-dependent, and the simplest approach works well across various experimental settings. Adapting English-centric models can yield better results than adapting multilingual models despite their worse initial performance on low-resource languages. Together, our work lays foundations on efficiently building language-specific LLMs by adapting existing LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prototypical-part models are a popular interpretable alternative to black-box deep learning models for computer vision. However, they are difficult to train, with high sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, inhibiting their application to new datasets and our understanding of which methods truly improve their performance. To facilitate the careful study of prototypical-part networks (ProtoPNets), we create a new framework for integrating components of prototypical-part models -- ProtoPNeXt. Using ProtoPNeXt, we show that applying Bayesian hyperparameter tuning and an angular prototype similarity metric to the original ProtoPNet is sufficient to produce new state-of-the-art accuracy for prototypical-part models on CUB-200 across multiple backbones. We further deploy this framework to jointly optimize for accuracy and prototype interpretability as measured by metrics included in ProtoPNeXt. Using the same resources, this produces models with substantially superior semantics and changes in accuracy between +1.3% and -1.5%. The code and trained models will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent evaluations of cross-domain text classification models aim to measure the ability of a model to obtain domain-invariant performance in a target domain given labeled samples in a source domain. The primary strategy for this evaluation relies on assumed differences between source domain samples and target domain samples in benchmark datasets. This evaluation strategy fails to account for the similarity between source and target domains, and may mask when models fail to transfer learning to specific target samples which are highly dissimilar from the source domain. We introduce Depth $F_1$, a novel cross-domain text classification performance metric. Designed to be complementary to existing classification metrics such as $F_1$, Depth $F_1$ measures how well a model performs on target samples which are dissimilar from the source domain. We motivate this metric using standard cross-domain text classification datasets and benchmark several recent cross-domain text classification models, with the goal of enabling in-depth evaluation of the semantic generalizability of cross-domain text classification models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kexin Tian, Haotian Shi, Yang Zhou, Sixu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in traffic dynamics within vehicular platoons, there exists a critical need for a modeling methodology with high accuracy while concurrently achieving physical analyzability. Currently, there are two predominant approaches: the physics model-based approach and the Artificial Intelligence (AI)--based approach. Knowing the facts that the physical-based model usually lacks sufficient modeling accuracy and potential function mismatches and the pure-AI-based method lacks analyzability, this paper innovatively proposes an AI-based Koopman approach to model the unknown nonlinear platoon dynamics harnessing the power of AI and simultaneously maintain physical analyzability, with a particular focus on periods of traffic oscillation. Specifically, this research first employs a deep learning framework to generate the embedding function that lifts the original space into the embedding space. Given the embedding space descriptiveness, the platoon dynamics can be expressed as a linear dynamical system founded by the Koopman theory. Based on that, the routine of linear dynamical system analysis can be conducted on the learned traffic linear dynamics in the embedding space. By that, the physical interpretability and analyzability of model-based methods with the heightened precision inherent in data-driven approaches can be synergized. Comparative experiments have been conducted with existing modeling approaches, which suggests our method's superiority in accuracy. Additionally, a phase plane analysis is performed, further evidencing our approach's effectiveness in replicating the complex dynamic patterns. Moreover, the proposed methodology is proven to feature the capability of analyzing the stability, attesting to the physical analyzability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The idea of personality in descriptive psychology, traditionally defined through observable behavior, has now been extended to Large Language Models (LLMs) to better understand their behavior. This raises a question: do LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality traits, similar to humans? Existing self-assessment personality tests, while applicable, lack the necessary validity and reliability for precise personality measurements. To address this, we introduce TRAIT, a new tool consisting of 8K multi-choice questions designed to assess the personality of LLMs with validity and reliability. TRAIT is built on the psychometrically validated human questionnaire, Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Short Dark Triad (SD-3), enhanced with the ATOMIC10X knowledge graph for testing personality in a variety of real scenarios. TRAIT overcomes the reliability and validity issues when measuring personality of LLM with self-assessment, showing the highest scores across three metrics: refusal rate, prompt sensitivity, and option order sensitivity. It reveals notable insights into personality of LLM: 1) LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality, which is highly influenced by their training data (i.e., data used for alignment tuning), and 2) current prompting techniques have limited effectiveness in eliciting certain traits, such as high psychopathy or low conscientiousness, suggesting the need for further research in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfonso Amayuelas, Xianjun Yang, Antonis Antoniades, Wenyue Hua, Liangming Pan, William Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional results on current benchmarks when working individually. The advancement in their capabilities, along with a reduction in parameter size and inference times, has facilitated the use of these models as agents, enabling interactions among multiple models to execute complex tasks. Such collaborations offer several advantages, including the use of specialized models (e.g. coding), improved confidence through multiple computations, and enhanced divergent thinking, leading to more diverse outputs. Thus, the collaborative use of language models is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. In this work, we evaluate the behavior of a network of models collaborating through debate under the influence of an adversary. We introduce pertinent metrics to assess the adversary's effectiveness, focusing on system accuracy and model agreement. Our findings highlight the importance of a model's persuasive ability in influencing others. Additionally, we explore inference-time methods to generate more compelling arguments and evaluate the potential of prompt-based mitigation as a defensive strategy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum programs are typically developed using quantum Software Development Kits (SDKs). The rapid advancement of quantum computing necessitates new tools to streamline this development process, and one such tool could be Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI). In this study, we introduce and use the Qiskit HumanEval dataset, a hand-curated collection of tasks designed to benchmark the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce quantum code using Qiskit - a quantum SDK. This dataset consists of more than 100 quantum computing tasks, each accompanied by a prompt, a canonical solution, a comprehensive test case, and a difficulty scale to evaluate the correctness of the generated solutions. We systematically assess the performance of a set of LLMs against the Qiskit HumanEval dataset's tasks and focus on the models ability in producing executable quantum code. Our findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs for generating quantum code but also establish a new benchmark for ongoing advancements in the field and encourage further exploration and development of GenAI-driven tools for quantum code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Elahi, Mahdis Nazari</p>
<p>Abstract: Current imaging methods for diagnosing BC are associated with limited sensitivity and specificity and modest positive predictive power. The recent progress in image analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) has created great promise to improve breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and subtype differentiation. In this case, novel quantitative computational methods, such as radiomics, have been developed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of early BC diagnosis and classification. The potential of radiomics in improving the diagnostic efficacy of imaging studies has been shown in several studies. In this review article, we discuss the radiomics workflow and current hand-crafted radiomics methods in the diagnosis and classification of BC based on most recent studies on different imaging modalities, e.g. MRI, mammography, contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), ultrasound imaging, and digital breast tumosynthesis (DBT). We also discuss current challenges and potential strategies to improve the specificity and sensitivity of radiomics in breast cancer to help achieve a higher level of BC classification and diagnosis in the clinical setting. The growing field of AI incorporation with imaging information has opened a great opportunity to provide a higher level of care for BC patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sefika Efeoglu, Adrian Paschke</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) is crucial for converting unstructured data into structured formats like Knowledge Graphs (KGs). A key task within IE is Relation Extraction (RE), which identifies relationships between entities in text. Various RE methods exist, including supervised, unsupervised, weakly supervised, and rule-based approaches. Recent studies leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown significant success in this area. In the current era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning these models can overcome limitations associated with zero-shot LLM prompting-based RE methods, especially regarding domain adaptation challenges and identifying implicit relations between entities in sentences. These implicit relations, which cannot be easily extracted from a sentence's dependency tree, require logical inference for accurate identification. This work explores the performance of fine-tuned LLMs and their integration into the Retrieval Augmented-based (RAG) RE approach to address the challenges of identifying implicit relations at the sentence level, particularly when LLMs act as generators within the RAG framework. Empirical evaluations on the TACRED, TACRED-Revisited (TACREV), Re-TACRED, and SemEVAL datasets show significant performance improvements with fine-tuned LLMs, including Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and T5 (Large). Notably, our approach achieves substantial gains on SemEVAL, where implicit relations are common, surpassing previous results on this dataset. Additionally, our method outperforms previous works on TACRED, TACREV, and Re-TACRED, demonstrating exceptional performance across diverse evaluation scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning models have revolutionized the field of speech processing. However, the process of fine-tuning these models on downstream tasks requires substantial computational resources, particularly when dealing with multiple speech-processing tasks. In this paper, we explore the potential of adapter-based fine-tuning in developing a unified model capable of effectively handling multiple spoken language processing tasks. The tasks we investigate are Automatic Speech Recognition, Phoneme Recognition, Intent Classification, Slot Filling, and Spoken Emotion Recognition. We validate our approach through a series of experiments on the SUPERB benchmark, and our results indicate that adapter-based fine-tuning enables a single encoder-decoder model to perform multiple speech processing tasks with an average improvement of 18.4% across the five target tasks while staying efficient in terms of parameter updates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lexin Zhou, Youmna Farag, Andreas Vlachos</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on dialogue constructiveness assessment focuses on (i) analysing conversational factors that influence individuals to take specific actions, win debates, change their perspectives or broaden their open-mindedness and (ii) predicting constructive outcomes following dialogues for such use cases. These objectives can be achieved by training either interpretable feature-based models (which often involve costly human annotations) or neural models such as pre-trained language models (which have empirically shown higher task accuracy but lack interpretability). We propose a novel LLM feature-based framework that combines the strengths of feature-based and neural approaches while mitigating their downsides, in assessing dialogue constructiveness. The framework first defines a set of dataset-independent and interpretable linguistic features, which can be extracted by both prompting an LLM and simple heuristics. Such features are then used to train LLM feature-based models. We apply this framework to three datasets of dialogue constructiveness and find that our LLM feature-based models significantly outperform standard feature-based models and neural models, and tend to learn more robust prediction rules instead of relying on superficial shortcuts (as seen with neural models). Further, we demonstrate that interpreting these LLM feature-based models can yield valuable insights into what makes a dialogue constructive.</p>

<p>Abstract: Validating safety-critical autonomous systems in high-dimensional domains such as robotics presents a significant challenge. Existing black-box approaches based on Markov chain Monte Carlo may require an enormous number of samples, while methods based on importance sampling often rely on simple parametric families that may struggle to represent the distribution over failures. We propose to sample the distribution over failures using a conditional denoising diffusion model, which has shown success in complex high-dimensional problems such as robotic task planning. We iteratively train a diffusion model to produce state trajectories closer to failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on high-dimensional robotic validation tasks, improving sample efficiency and mode coverage compared to existing black-box techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxi Zhang, Jing Zhang, Yanling Wang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale knowledge bases (KBs) like Freebase and Wikidata house millions of structured knowledge. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) provides a user-friendly way to access these valuable KBs via asking natural language questions. In order to improve the generalization capabilities of KBQA models, extensive research has embraced a retrieve-then-reason framework to retrieve relevant evidence for logical expression generation. These multi-stage efforts prioritize acquiring external sources but overlook the incorporation of new knowledge into their model parameters. In effect, even advanced language models and retrievers have knowledge boundaries, thereby limiting the generalization capabilities of previous KBQA models. Therefore, this paper develops KBLLaMA, which follows a learn-then-reason framework to inject new KB knowledge into a large language model for flexible end-to-end KBQA. At the core of KBLLaMA, we study (1) how to organize new knowledge about KBQA and (2) how to facilitate the learning of the organized knowledge. Extensive experiments on various KBQA generalization tasks showcase the state-of-the-art performance of KBLLaMA. Especially on the general benchmark GrailQA and domain-specific benchmark Bio-chemical, KBLLaMA respectively derives a performance gain of up to 3.8% and 9.8% compared to the baselines.</p>

We demonstrate improved performance both in training domains as well as zero-shot in domains where the models have seen no queries. We analyze performance changes in various fine-tuning scenarios and offer findings of immediate use to practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiali Cheng, Hadi Amiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Unlearning (MU) have introduced solutions to selectively remove certain training samples, such as those with outdated or sensitive information, from trained models. Despite these advancements, evaluation of MU methods have been inconsistent, employing different trained models and architectures, and sample removal strategies, which hampers accurate comparison. In addition, prior MU approaches have mainly focused on singular tasks or modalities, which is not comprehensive. To address these limitations, we develop MU-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for MU that (i) unifies the sets of deleted samples and trained models, and (ii) provides broad coverage of tasks and data modalities, including previously unexplored domains such as speech and video classification. Our evaluation show that RandLabel and SalUn are the most effective general MU approaches on MU-Bench, and BadT and SCRUB are capable of achieving random performance on the deletion set. We analyze several under-investigated aspects of unlearning, including scalability, the impacts of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and curriculum learning, and susceptibility to dataset biases. MU-Bench provides an easy-to-use package that includes dataset splits, models, and implementations, together with a leader board to enable unified and scalable MU research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangbo Pei, Zhuqing Jiang, Aidong Men, Haiying Wang, Haiyong Luo, Shiping Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-camera-training person re-identification (SCT re-ID) aims to train a re-ID model using SCT datasets where each person appears in only one camera. The main challenge of SCT re-ID is to learn camera-invariant feature representations without cross-camera same-person (CCSP) data as supervision. Previous methods address it by assuming that the most similar person should be found in another camera. However, this assumption is not guaranteed to be correct. In this paper, we propose a Camera-Invariant Meta-Learning Network (CIMN) for SCT re-ID. CIMN assumes that the camera-invariant feature representations should be robust to camera changes. To this end, we split the training data into meta-train set and meta-test set based on camera IDs and perform a cross-camera simulation via meta-learning strategy, aiming to enforce the representations learned from the meta-train set to be robust to the meta-test set. With the cross-camera simulation, CIMN can learn camera-invariant and identity-discriminative representations even there are no CCSP data. However, this simulation also causes the separation of the meta-train set and the meta-test set, which ignores some beneficial relations between them. Thus, we introduce three losses: meta triplet loss, meta classification loss, and meta camera alignment loss, to leverage the ignored relations. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance with and without CCSP data, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on SCT re-ID benchmarks. In addition, it is also effective in improving the domain generalization ability of the model.</p>

Our model runs at 6-hourly time steps and is shown to be stable for 10-year-long simulations. Our approach beats relevant baselines and nearly reaches a gold standard for successful climate model emulation. We discuss the key design choices behind our dynamics-informed diffusion model-based approach which enables this significant step towards efficient, data-driven climate simulations that can help us better understand the Earth and adapt to a changing climate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeid Ghasemshirazi, Ghazaleh Shirvani</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of the IoT, the security of connected devices has become a paramount concern. This paper explores the concept of proactive threat hunting as a pivotal strategy for enhancing the security and sustainability of IoT systems. Proactive threat hunting is an alternative to traditional reactive security measures that analyses IoT networks continuously and in advance to find and eliminate threats before they occure. By improving the security posture of IoT devices this approach significantly contributes to extending IoT operational lifespan and reduces environmental impact. By integrating security metrics similar to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) into consumer platforms, this paper argues that proactive threat hunting can elevate user awareness about the security of IoT devices. This has the potential to impact consumer choices and encourage a security-conscious mindset in both the manufacturing and user communities. Through a comprehensive analysis, this study demonstrates how proactive threat hunting can contribute to the development of a more secure, sustainable, and user-aware IoT ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guido Di Federico, Louis J. Durlofsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to "denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic "true" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate brain lesion delineation is important for planning neurosurgical treatment. Automatic brain lesion segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, neural network performance is constrained by the lack of large-scale well-annotated training datasets. In this manuscript, we propose a comprehensive framework to efficiently generate new, realistic samples for training a brain lesion segmentation model. We first train a lesion generator, based on an adversarial autoencoder, in a self-supervised manner. Next, we utilize a novel image composition algorithm, Soft Poisson Blending, to seamlessly combine synthetic lesions and brain images to obtain training samples. Finally, to effectively train the brain lesion segmentation model with augmented images we introduce a new prototype consistence regularization to align real and synthetic features. Our framework is validated by extensive experiments on two public brain lesion segmentation datasets: ATLAS v2.0 and Shift MS. Our method outperforms existing brain image data augmentation schemes. For instance, our method improves the Dice from 50.36% to 60.23% compared to the U-Net with conventional data augmentation techniques for the ATLAS v2.0 dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Noise ubiquitously exists in signals due to numerous factors including physical, electronic, and environmental effects. Traditional methods of symbolic regression, such as genetic programming or deep learning models, aim to find the most fitting expressions for these signals. However, these methods often overlook the noise present in real-world data, leading to reduced fitting accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose \textit{\textbf{D}eep Symbolic Regression against \textbf{N}oise via \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning (DN-CL)}. DN-CL employs two parameter-sharing encoders to embed data points from various data transformations into feature shields against noise. This model treats noisy data and clean data as different views of the ground-truth mathematical expressions. Distances between these features are minimized, utilizing contrastive learning to distinguish between 'positive' noise-corrected pairs and 'negative' contrasting pairs. Our experiments indicate that DN-CL demonstrates superior performance in handling both noisy and clean data, presenting a promising method of symbolic regression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning -- a fundamental component of human cognition -- remains under-explored. We develop novel benchmarks that cover diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Erfan Sadeghi, Arash Fayyazi, Seyedarmin Azizi, Massoud Pedram</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on hardware platforms, specially Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), presents many challenges, which are mainly due to the substantial computational and power requirements of their non-linear functions, notably layer normalization, softmax, and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). These critical functions pose significant obstacles to efficient hardware implementation due to their complex mathematical operations and the inherent resource count and architectural limitations of FPGAs. PEANO-ViT offers a novel approach to streamlining the implementation of the layer normalization layer by introducing a division-free technique that simultaneously approximates the division and square root function. Additionally, PEANO-ViT provides a multi-scale division strategy to eliminate division operations in the softmax layer, aided by a Pade-based approximation for the exponential function. Finally, PEANO-ViT introduces a piece-wise linear approximation for the GELU function, carefully designed to bypass the computationally intensive operations associated with GELU. In our comprehensive evaluations, PEANO-ViT exhibits minimal accuracy degradation (<= 0.5% for DeiT-B) while significantly enhancing power efficiency, achieving improvements of 1.91x, 1.39x, 8.01x for layer normalization, softmax, and GELU, respectively. This improvement is achieved through substantial reductions in DSP, LUT, and register counts for these non-linear operations. Consequently, PEANO-ViT enables efficient deployment of Vision Transformers on resource- and power-constrained FPGA platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Wong, Alfonso Amayuelas, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on code generation tasks. A recent application of LLMs for code generation is iterative code repair, where a model fixes an incorrect program by rationalizing about errors and generating a new program. However, code repair is primarily studied on high-resource languages like Python, and the framework's efficacy is under-explored on low-resource languages. To apply code repair for low-resource languages, we propose Distilling Low-Resource Repairs (DistiLRR), an approach that transfers the reasoning and code generation ability from a teacher model to a student model. Our results show that DistiLRR consistently outperforms baselines on low-resource languages, but has similar performance on high-resource languages. To investigate this behavior, we perform a further analysis and find that the correlation between rationale quality and code correctness is weaker than previously perceived. We hypothesize this weakness is magnified in low-resource settings where base models lack deep knowledge of a programming language, leading to wavering benefits of code repair between high-resource and low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Kloker, Matthew Bazanya, Twaha Kateete</p>
<p>Abstract: Trust plays a pivotal role in Lecturer-Student-Collaboration, encompassing teaching and research aspects. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in platforms like Open AI's ChatGPT, coupled with their cost-effectiveness and high-quality results, has led to their rapid adoption among university students. However, discerning genuine student input from LLM-generated output poses a challenge for lecturers. This dilemma jeopardizes the trust relationship between lecturers and students, potentially impacting university downstream activities, particularly collaborative research initiatives. Despite attempts to establish guidelines for student LLM use, a clear framework mutually beneficial for lecturers and students in higher education remains elusive. This study addresses the research question: How does the use of LLMs by students impact Informational and Procedural Justice, influencing Team Trust and Expected Team Performance? Methodically, we applied a quantitative construct-based survey, evaluated using techniques of Structural Equation Modelling (PLS- SEM) to examine potential relationships among these constructs. Our findings based on 23 valid respondents from Ndejje University indicate that lecturers are less concerned about the fairness of LLM use per se but are more focused on the transparency of student utilization, which significantly influences Team Trust positively. This research contributes to the global discourse on integrating and regulating LLMs and subsequent models in education. We propose that guidelines should support LLM use while enforcing transparency in Lecturer-Student- Collaboration to foster Team Trust and Performance. The study contributes valuable insights for shaping policies enabling ethical and transparent LLMs usage in education to ensure effectiveness of collaborative learning environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deokjae Lee, Hyun Oh Song, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning is increasingly adopted for expensive multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems, but it involves a challenging subset selection problem, optimizing the batch acquisition score that quantifies the goodness of a batch for evaluation. Due to the excessively large search space of the subset selection problem, prior methods optimize the batch acquisition on the latent space, which has discrepancies with the actual space, or optimize individual acquisition scores without considering the dependencies among candidates in a batch instead of directly optimizing the batch acquisition. To manage the vast search space, a simple and effective approach is the greedy method, which decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems, yet it has difficulty in parallelization since each subproblem depends on the outcome from the previous ones. To this end, we introduce a novel greedy-style subset selection algorithm that optimizes batch acquisition directly on the combinatorial space by sequential greedy sampling from the greedy policy, specifically trained to address all greedy subproblems concurrently. Notably, our experiments on the red fluorescent proteins design task show that our proposed method achieves the baseline performance in 1.69x fewer queries, demonstrating its efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Candida M. Greco, Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Verbs form the backbone of language, providing the structure and meaning to sentences. Yet, their intricate semantic nuances pose a longstanding challenge. Understanding verb relations through the concept of lexical entailment is crucial for comprehending sentence meanings and grasping verb dynamics. This work investigates the capabilities of eight Large Language Models in recognizing lexical entailment relations among verbs through differently devised prompting strategies and zero-/few-shot settings over verb pairs from two lexical databases, namely WordNet and HyperLex. Our findings unveil that the models can tackle the lexical entailment recognition task with moderately good performance, although at varying degree of effectiveness and under different conditions. Also, utilizing few-shot prompting can enhance the models' performance. However, perfectly solving the task arises as an unmet challenge for all examined LLMs, which raises an emergence for further research developments on this topic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\%-36\%$ to within $5\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjong Cheon</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of deep learning, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has emerged as a potential alternative to multilayer projections (MLPs). However, its applicability to vision tasks has not been extensively validated. In our study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of KAN for vision tasks through multiple trials on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, using a training batch size of 32. Our results showed that while KAN outperformed the original MLP-Mixer on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, it performed slightly worse than the state-of-the-art ResNet-18. These findings suggest that KAN holds significant promise for vision tasks, and further modifications could enhance its performance in future evaluations.Our contributions are threefold: first, we showcase the efficiency of KAN-based algorithms for visual tasks; second, we provide extensive empirical assessments across various vision benchmarks, comparing KAN's performance with MLP-Mixer, CNNs, and Vision Transformers (ViT); and third, we pioneer the use of natural KAN layers in visual tasks, addressing a gap in previous research. This paper lays the foundation for future studies on KANs, highlighting their potential as a reliable alternative for image classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computing the trajectories of mandibular condyles directly from MRI could provide a comprehensive examination, allowing for the extraction of both anatomical and kinematic details. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of extracting 3D condylar trajectories from 2D real-time MRI and to assess their precision.Twenty healthy subjects underwent real-time MRI while opening and closing their jaws. One axial and two sagittal slices were segmented using a U-Net-based algorithm. The centers of mass of the resulting masks were projected onto the coordinate system based on anatomical markers and temporally adjusted using a common projection. The quality of the computed trajectories was evaluated using metrics designed to estimate movement reproducibility, head motion, and slice placement symmetry.The segmentation of the axial slices demonstrated good-to-excellent quality; however, the segmentation of the sagittal slices required some fine-tuning. The movement reproducibility was acceptable for most cases; nevertheless, head motion displaced the trajectories by 1 mm on average. The difference in the superior-inferior coordinate of the condyles in the closed jaw position was 1.7 mm on average.Despite limitations in precision, real-time MRI enables the extraction of condylar trajectories with sufficient accuracy for evaluating clinically relevant parameters such as condyle displacement, trajectories aspect, and symmetry.</p>

Crafting a new video from large video libraries remains a challenge. In this paper we introduce the task of Video Library Question Answering (VLQA) through an interoperable architecture that applies Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to video libraries. We propose a system that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate search queries, retrieving relevant video moments indexed by speech and visual metadata. An answer generation module then integrates user queries with this metadata to produce responses with specific video timestamps. This approach shows promise in multimedia content retrieval, and AI-assisted video content creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kris De Asis, Richard S. Sutton</p>
<p>Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms are built on an assumption that an agent interacts with an environment over fixed-duration, discrete time steps. However, physical systems are continuous in time, requiring a choice of time-discretization granularity when digitally controlling them. Furthermore, such systems do not wait for decisions to be made before advancing the environment state, necessitating the study of how the choice of discretization may affect a reinforcement learning algorithm. In this work, we consider the relationship between the definitions of the continuous-time and discrete-time returns. Specifically, we acknowledge an idiosyncrasy with naively applying a discrete-time algorithm to a discretized continuous-time environment, and note how a simple modification can better align the return definitions. This observation is of practical consideration when dealing with environments where time-discretization granularity is a choice, or situations where such granularity is inherently stochastic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangkun Nie, Qinghao Zhao, Gongzheng Tang, Jun Li, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is emerging as a crucial tool for monitoring human hemodynamics, with recent studies highlighting its potential in assessing vascular aging through deep learning. However, real-world age distributions are often imbalanced, posing significant challenges for deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce a novel, simple, and effective loss function named the Dist Loss to address deep imbalanced regression tasks. We trained a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Net1D) incorporating the Dist Loss on the extensive UK Biobank dataset (n=502,389) to estimate vascular age from PPG signals and validate its efficacy in characterizing cardiovascular health. The model's performance was validated on a 40% held-out test set, achieving state-of-the-art results, especially in regions with small sample sizes. Furthermore, we divided the population into three subgroups based on the difference between predicted vascular age and chronological age: less than -10 years, between -10 and 10 years, and greater than 10 years. We analyzed the relationship between predicted vascular age and several cardiovascular events over a follow-up period of up to 10 years, including death, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. Our results indicate that the predicted vascular age has significant potential to reflect an individual's cardiovascular health status.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohong Ji, Wang Zhen, Zhifeng Gao, Hang Zheng, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Weinan E</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, pretraining models have made significant advancements in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and life sciences. The significant advancements in NLP and CV are predominantly driven by the expansion of model parameters and data size, a phenomenon now recognized as the scaling laws. However, research exploring scaling law in molecular pretraining models remains unexplored. In this work, we present Uni-Mol2 , an innovative molecular pretraining model that leverages a two-track transformer to effectively integrate features at the atomic level, graph level, and geometry structure level. Along with this, we systematically investigate the scaling law within molecular pretraining models, characterizing the power-law correlations between validation loss and model size, dataset size, and computational resources. Consequently, we successfully scale Uni-Mol2 to 1.1 billion parameters through pretraining on 800 million conformations, making it the largest molecular pretraining model to date. Extensive experiments show consistent improvement in the downstream tasks as the model size grows. The Uni-Mol2 with 1.1B parameters also outperforms existing methods, achieving an average 27% improvement on the QM9 and 14% on COMPAS-1D dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objective. (1) To assess whether neural tissue structure and biomechanics could predict functional loss in glaucoma; (2) To evaluate the importance of biomechanics in making such predictions. Design, Setting and Participants. We recruited 238 glaucoma subjects. For one eye of each subject, we imaged the optic nerve head (ONH) using spectral-domain OCT under the following conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with acute IOP elevation. Main Outcomes: We utilized automatic segmentation of optic nerve head (ONH) tissues and digital volume correlation (DVC) analysis to compute intraocular pressure (IOP)-induced neural tissue strains. A robust geometric deep learning approach, known as Point-Net, was employed to predict the full Humphrey 24-2 pattern standard deviation (PSD) maps from ONH structural and biomechanical information. For each point in each PSD map, we predicted whether it exhibited no defect or a PSD value of less than 5%. Predictive performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and the F1-score. We compared the model's performance with and without the inclusion of IOP-induced strains to assess the impact of biomechanics on prediction accuracy. Results: Integrating biomechanical (IOP-induced neural tissue strains) and structural (tissue morphology and neural tissues thickness) information yielded a significantly better predictive model (F1-score: 0.76+-0.02) across validation subjects, as opposed to relying only on structural information, which resulted in a significantly lower F1-score of 0.71+-0.02 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study has shown that the integration of biomechanical data can significantly improve the accuracy of visual field loss predictions. This highlights the importance of the biomechanics-function relationship in glaucoma, and suggests that biomechanics may serve as a crucial indicator for the development and progression of glaucoma.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatsuya Kamijo, Cristian C. Beltran-Hernandez, Masashi Hamaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating dexterous, contact-rich manipulation tasks using rigid robots is a significant challenge in robotics. Rigid robots, defined by their actuation through position commands, face issues of excessive contact forces due to their inability to adapt to contact with the environment, potentially causing damage. While compliance control schemes have been introduced to mitigate these issues by controlling forces via external sensors, they are hampered by the need for fine-tuning task-specific controller parameters. Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) offers an intuitive alternative, allowing robots to learn manipulations through observed actions. In this work, we introduce a novel system to enhance the teaching of dexterous, contact-rich manipulations to rigid robots. Our system is twofold: firstly, it incorporates a teleoperation interface utilizing Virtual Reality (VR) controllers, designed to provide an intuitive and cost-effective method for task demonstration with haptic feedback. Secondly, we present Comp-ACT (Compliance Control via Action Chunking with Transformers), a method that leverages the demonstrations to learn variable compliance control from a few demonstrations. Our methods have been validated across various complex contact-rich manipulation tasks using single-arm and bimanual robot setups in simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our system in teaching robots dexterous manipulations with enhanced adaptability and safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced user-bot interactions, enabling more complex and coherent dialogues. However, the prevalent text-only modality might not fully exploit the potential for effective user engagement. This paper explores the impact of multi-modal interactions, which incorporate images and audio alongside text, on user engagement in chatbot conversations. We conduct a comprehensive analysis using a diverse set of chatbots and real-user interaction data, employing metrics such as retention rate and conversation length to evaluate user engagement. Our findings reveal a significant enhancement in user engagement with multi-modal interactions compared to text-only dialogues. Notably, the incorporation of a third modality significantly amplifies engagement beyond the benefits observed with just two modalities. These results suggest that multi-modal interactions optimize cognitive processing and facilitate richer information comprehension. This study underscores the importance of multi-modality in chatbot design, offering valuable insights for creating more engaging and immersive AI communication experiences and informing the broader AI community about the benefits of multi-modal interactions in enhancing user engagement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando De Meer Pardo, Claude Lehmann, Dennis Gehrig, Andrea Nagy, Stefano Nicoli, Branka Hadji Misheva, Martin Braschler, Kurt Stockinger</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-source Entity Matching problem, which we call entity group matching, where the goal is to assign to the same group, records originating from multiple data sources but representing the same real-world entity. We focus on the effects of transitively matched records, i.e. the records connected by paths in the graph G = (V,E) whose nodes and edges represent the records and whether they are a match or not. We present a real-world instance of this problem, where the challenge is to match records of companies and financial securities originating from different data providers. We also introduce two new multi-source benchmark datasets that present similar matching challenges as real-world records. A distinctive characteristic of these records is that they are regularly updated following real-world events, but updates are not applied uniformly across data sources. This phenomenon makes the matching of certain groups of records only possible through the use of transitive information.
  In our experiments, we illustrate how considering transitively matched records is challenging since a limited amount of false positive pairwise match predictions can throw off the group assignment of large quantities of records. Thus, we propose GraLMatch, a method that can partially detect and remove false positive pairwise predictions through graph-based properties. Finally, we showcase how fine-tuning a Transformer-based model (DistilBERT) on a reduced number of labeled samples yields a better final entity group matching than training on more samples and/or incorporating fine-tuning optimizations, illustrating how precision becomes the deciding factor in the entity group matching of large volumes of records.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Kanagawa, Kenji Doya</p>
<p>Abstract: The reward system is one of the fundamental drivers of animal behaviors and is critical for survival and reproduction. Despite its importance, the problem of how the reward system has evolved is underexplored. In this paper, we try to replicate the evolution of biologically plausible reward functions and investigate how environmental conditions affect evolved rewards' shape. For this purpose, we developed a population-based decentralized evolutionary simulation framework, where agents maintain their energy level to live longer and produce more children. Each agent inherits its reward function from its parent subject to mutation and learns to get rewards via reinforcement learning throughout its lifetime. Our results show that biologically reasonable positive rewards for food acquisition and negative rewards for motor action can evolve from randomly initialized ones. However, we also find that the rewards for motor action diverge into two modes: largely positive and slightly negative. The emergence of positive motor action rewards is surprising because it can make agents too active and inefficient in foraging. In environments with poor and poisonous foods, the evolution of rewards for less important foods tends to be unstable, while rewards for normal foods are still stable. These results demonstrate the usefulness of our simulation environment and energy-dependent birth and death model for further studies of the origin of reward systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Lupu, Chris Lu, Jarek Liesen, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to condense large datasets into a small number of synthetic examples that can be used as drop-in replacements when training new models. It has applications to interpretability, neural architecture search, privacy, and continual learning. Despite strong successes in supervised domains, such methods have not yet been extended to reinforcement learning, where the lack of a fixed dataset renders most distillation methods unusable. Filling the gap, we formalize behaviour distillation, a setting that aims to discover and then condense the information required for training an expert policy into a synthetic dataset of state-action pairs, without access to expert data. We then introduce Hallucinating Datasets with Evolution Strategies (HaDES), a method for behaviour distillation that can discover datasets of just four state-action pairs which, under supervised learning, train agents to competitive performance levels in continuous control tasks. We show that these datasets generalize out of distribution to training policies with a wide range of architectures and hyperparameters. We also demonstrate application to a downstream task, namely training multi-task agents in a zero-shot fashion. Beyond behaviour distillation, HaDES provides significant improvements in neuroevolution for RL over previous approaches and achieves SoTA results on one standard supervised dataset distillation task. Finally, we show that visualizing the synthetic datasets can provide human-interpretable task insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adnan Ali, Jinlong Li, Huanhuan Chen, Ali Kashif Bashir</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to contrast positive-negative counterparts to learn the node embeddings, whereas graph data augmentation methods are employed to generate these positive-negative samples. The variation, quantity, and quality of negative samples compared to positive samples play crucial roles in learning meaningful embeddings for node classification downstream tasks. Less variation, excessive quantity, and low-quality negative samples cause the model to be overfitted for particular nodes, resulting in less robust models. To solve the overfitting problem in the GCL paradigm, this study proposes a novel Cumulative Sample Selection (CSS) algorithm by comprehensively considering negative samples' quality, variations, and quantity. Initially, three negative sample pools are constructed: easy, medium, and hard negative samples, which contain 25%, 50%, and 25% of the total available negative samples, respectively. Then, 10% negative samples are selected from each of these three negative sample pools for training the model. After that, a decision agent module evaluates model training results and decides whether to explore more negative samples from three negative sample pools by increasing the ratio or keep exploiting the current sampling ratio. The proposed algorithm is integrated into a proposed graph contrastive learning framework named NegAmplify. NegAmplify is compared with the SOTA methods on nine graph node classification datasets, with seven achieving better node classification accuracy with up to 2.86% improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Fan, Xun Gong, Cenyang Zheng, Yafei Ou</p>
<p>Abstract: The intersection of medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging research topic with advantages including patient engagement and clinical expert involvement for second opinions. However, existing Med-VQA methods based on joint embedding fail to explain whether their provided results are based on correct reasoning or coincidental answers, which undermines the credibility of VQA answers. In this paper, we investigate the construction of a more cohesive and stable Med-VQA structure. Motivated by causal effect, we propose a novel Triangular Reasoning VQA (Tri-VQA) framework, which constructs reverse causal questions from the perspective of "Why this answer?" to elucidate the source of the answer and stimulate more reasonable forward reasoning processes. We evaluate our method on the Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) multi-attribute annotated dataset from five centers, and test it on medical VQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Tri_VQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Dietz, Thomas Altstidl, Dario Zanca, Bj\"orn Eskofier, An Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed-type time series (MTTS) is a bimodal data type that is common in many domains, such as healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and social media. It consists of regularly sampled continuous time series and irregularly sampled categorical event sequences. The integration of both modalities through multimodal fusion is a promising approach for processing MTTS. However, the question of how to effectively fuse both modalities remains open. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of several deep multimodal fusion approaches for MTTS forecasting. Our comparison includes three fusion types (early, intermediate, and late) and five fusion methods (concatenation, weighted mean, weighted mean with correlation, gating, and feature sharing). We evaluate these fusion approaches on three distinct datasets, one of which was generated using a novel framework. This framework allows for the control of key data properties, such as the strength and direction of intermodal interactions, modality imbalance, and the degree of randomness in each modality, providing a more controlled environment for testing fusion approaches. Our findings show that the performance of different fusion approaches can be substantially influenced by the direction and strength of intermodal interactions. The study reveals that early and intermediate fusion approaches excel at capturing fine-grained and coarse-grained cross-modal features, respectively. These findings underscore the crucial role of intermodal interactions in determining the most effective fusion strategy for MTTS forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Roy, Anurag Bhattacharjee, Diego Oliva, Oscar Ramos-Soto, Francisco J. Alvarez-Padilla, Ram Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Pneumonia is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. It affects many people, particularly those in developing or underdeveloped nations with high pollution levels, unhygienic living conditions, overcrowding, and insufficient medical infrastructure. Pneumonia can cause pleural effusion, where fluids fill the lungs, leading to respiratory difficulty. Early diagnosis is crucial to ensure effective treatment and increase survival rates. Chest X-ray imaging is the most commonly used method for diagnosing pneumonia. However, visual examination of chest X-rays can be difficult and subjective. In this study, we have developed a computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. We have used DenseNet-121 and ResNet50 as the backbone for the binary class (pneumonia and normal) and multi-class (bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal) classification tasks, respectively. We have also implemented a channel-specific spatial attention mechanism, called Fuzzy Channel Selective Spatial Attention Module (FCSSAM), to highlight the specific spatial regions of relevant channels while removing the irrelevant channels of the extracted features by the backbone. We evaluated the proposed approach on a publicly available chest X-ray dataset, using binary and multi-class classification setups. Our proposed method achieves accuracy rates of 97.15\% and 79.79\% for the binary and multi-class classification setups, respectively. The results of our proposed method are superior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The code of the proposed model will be available at: https://github.com/AyushRoy2001/FA-Net.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction. The emergence of edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) presents challenges in constructing intricate deep learning models due to constraints in memory and computational resources. Moreover, emotional speech data often contains private information, raising concerns about privacy leakage during the deployment of SER models. To address these challenges, we propose a data distillation framework to facilitate efficient development of SER models in IoT applications using a synthesised, smaller, and distilled dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that the distilled dataset can be effectively utilised to train SER models with fixed initialisation, achieving performances comparable to those developed using the original full emotional speech dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Roy, Sujan Sarkar, Sohom Ghosal, Dmitrii Kaplun, Asya Lyanova, Ram Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Skin cancer is a highly dangerous type of cancer that requires an accurate diagnosis from experienced physicians. To help physicians diagnose skin cancer more efficiently, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system can be very helpful. In this paper, we propose a novel model, which uses a novel attention mechanism to pinpoint the differences in features across the spatial dimensions and symmetry of the lesion, thereby focusing on the dissimilarities of various classes based on symmetry, uniformity in texture and color, etc. Additionally, to take into account the variations in the boundaries of the lesions for different classes, we employ a gradient-based fusion of wavelet and soft attention-aided features to extract boundary information of skin lesions. We have tested our model on the multi-class and highly class-imbalanced dataset, called HAM10000, and achieved promising results, with a 91.17\% F1-score and 90.75\% accuracy.

<p>Abstract: The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked concerns about their potential to spread misinformation. As a result, there is a pressing need for tools to identify ``fake arguments'' generated by such models. To create these tools, examples of texts generated by LLMs are needed. This paper introduces a methodology to obtain good, bad and ugly arguments from argumentative essays produced by ChatGPT, OpenAI's LLM. We then describe a novel dataset containing a set of diverse arguments, ArGPT. We assess the effectiveness of our dataset and establish baselines for several argumentation-related tasks. Finally, we show that the artificially generated data relates well to human argumentation and thus is useful as a tool to train and test systems for the defined tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxin Yang, Wanling Gao, Luzhou Peng, Yunyou Huang, Fei Tang, Jianfeng Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing and optimizing neural network architectures typically requires extensive expertise, starting with handcrafted designs and then manual or automated refinement. This dependency presents a significant barrier to rapid innovation. Recognizing the complexity of automatically generating neural network architecture from scratch, we introduce Younger, a pioneering dataset to advance this ambitious goal. Derived from over 174K real-world models across more than 30 tasks from various public model hubs, Younger includes 7,629 unique architectures, and each is represented as a directed acyclic graph with detailed operator-level information. The dataset facilitates two primary design paradigms: global, for creating complete architectures from scratch, and local, for detailed architecture component refinement. By establishing these capabilities, Younger contributes to a new frontier, Artificial Intelligence-Generated Neural Network Architecture (AIGNNA). Our experiments explore the potential and effectiveness of Younger for automated architecture generation and, as a secondary benefit, demonstrate that Younger can serve as a benchmark dataset, advancing the development of graph neural networks. We release the dataset and code publicly to lower the entry barriers and encourage further research in this challenging area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Quach, Makram Chahine, Alexander Amini, Ramin Hasani, Daniela Rus</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulators are powerful tools for autonomous robot learning as they offer scalable data generation, flexible design, and optimization of trajectories. However, transferring behavior learned from simulation data into the real world proves to be difficult, usually mitigated with compute-heavy domain randomization methods or further model fine-tuning. We present a method to improve generalization and robustness to distribution shifts in sim-to-real visual quadrotor navigation tasks. To this end, we first build a simulator by integrating Gaussian Splatting with quadrotor flight dynamics, and then, train robust navigation policies using Liquid neural networks. In this way, we obtain a full-stack imitation learning protocol that combines advances in 3D Gaussian splatting radiance field rendering, crafty programming of expert demonstration training data, and the task understanding capabilities of Liquid networks. Through a series of quantitative flight tests, we demonstrate the robust transfer of navigation skills learned in a single simulation scene directly to the real world. We further show the ability to maintain performance beyond the training environment under drastic distribution and physical environment changes. Our learned Liquid policies, trained on single target manoeuvres curated from a photorealistic simulated indoor flight only, generalize to multi-step hikes onboard a real hardware platform outdoors.</p>

We introduce Generative Topological Networks (GTNs) -- a new class of generative models that addresses these shortcomings. GTNs are trained deterministically using a simple supervised learning approach grounded in topology theory. GTNs are fast to train, and require only a single forward pass in a standard feedforward neural network to generate samples. We demonstrate the strengths of GTNs in several datasets, including MNIST, celebA and the Hands and Palm Images dataset. Finally, the theory behind GTNs offers insights into how to train generative models for improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Azzolin, Antonio Longa, Stefano Teso, Andrea Passerini</p>
<p>Abstract: As Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become more pervasive, it becomes paramount to build robust tools for computing explanations of their predictions. A key desideratum is that these explanations are faithful, i.e., that they portray an accurate picture of the GNN's reasoning process. A number of different faithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what faithfulness is exactly, and what its properties are. We begin by showing that existing metrics are not interchangeable -- i.e., explanations attaining high faithfulness according to one metric may be unfaithful according to others -- and can be systematically insensitive to important properties of the explanation, and suggest how to address these issues. We proceed to show that, surprisingly, optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal. Specifically, we show that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly faithful explanations are completely uninformative. The situation is different for modular GNNs, such as self-explainable and domain-invariant architectures, where optimizing faithfulness does not compromise informativeness, and is also unexpectedly tied to out-of-distribution generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling idiomatic or non-compositional language has been a longstanding challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This is partly because these expressions do not derive their meanings solely from their constituent words, but also due to the scarcity of relevant data resources, and their impact on the performance of downstream tasks such as machine translation and simplification. In this paper we propose an approach to model idiomaticity effectively using a triplet loss that incorporates the asymmetric contribution of components words to an idiomatic meaning for training language models by using adaptive contrastive learning and resampling miners to build an idiomatic-aware learning objective. Our proposed method is evaluated on a SemEval challenge and outperforms previous alternatives significantly in many metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 Turbo in generating educational questions from NCERT textbooks in zero-shot mode. Our study highlights GPT-4 Turbo's ability to generate questions that require higher-order thinking skills, especially at the "understanding" level according to Bloom's Revised Taxonomy. While we find a notable consistency between questions generated by GPT-4 Turbo and those assessed by humans in terms of complexity, there are occasional differences. Our evaluation also uncovers variations in how humans and machines evaluate question quality, with a trend inversely related to Bloom's Revised Taxonomy levels. These findings suggest that while GPT-4 Turbo is a promising tool for educational question generation, its efficacy varies across different cognitive levels, indicating a need for further refinement to fully meet educational standards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large text-conditional image generative models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E 3 have revolutionized the field of image generation, allowing users to produce high-quality, realistic images from textual prompts. While these developments have enhanced artistic creation and visual communication, they also present an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence society and spread propaganda. In this paper, we demonstrate the possibility of such a bias injection threat by an adversary who backdoors such models with a small number of malicious data samples; the implemented backdoor is activated when special triggers exist in the input prompt of the backdoored models. On the other hand, the model's utility is preserved in the absence of the triggers, making the attack highly undetectable. We present a novel framework that enables efficient generation of poisoning samples with composite (multi-word) triggers for such an attack. Our extensive experiments using over 1 million generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases can bypass conventional detection mechanisms, highlighting the challenges in proving the existence of biases within operational constraints. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in text-to-image generation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chest pain symptoms are highly prevalent in emergency departments (EDs), where acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a catastrophic cardiovascular emergency with a high fatality rate, especially when timely and accurate treatment is not administered. However, current triage practices in the ED can cause up to approximately half of patients with AAS to have an initially missed diagnosis or be misdiagnosed as having other acute chest pain conditions. Subsequently, these AAS patients will undergo clinically inaccurate or suboptimal differential diagnosis. Fortunately, even under these suboptimal protocols, nearly all these patients underwent non-contrast CT covering the aorta anatomy at the early stage of differential diagnosis. In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence model (DeepAAS) using non-contrast CT, which is highly accurate for identifying AAS and provides interpretable results to assist in clinical decision-making. Performance was assessed in two major phases: a multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750) and an exploration in real-world emergency scenarios (n = 137,525). In the multi-center cohort, DeepAAS achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the real-world cohort, DeepAAS detected 109 AAS patients with misguided initial suspicion, achieving 92.6% (95% CI 76.2%-97.5%) in mean sensitivity and 99.2% (95% CI 99.1%-99.3%) in mean specificity. Our AI model performed well on non-contrast CT at all applicable early stages of differential diagnosis workflows, effectively reduced the overall missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis rate from 48.8% to 4.8% and shortened the diagnosis time for patients with misguided initial suspicion from an average of 681.8 (74-11,820) mins to 68.5 (23-195) mins. DeepAAS could effectively fill the gap in the current clinical workflow without requiring additional tests.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, generated content in music has gained significant popularity, with large language models being effectively utilized to produce human-like lyrics in various styles, themes, and linguistic structures. This technological advancement supports artists in their creative processes but also raises issues of authorship infringement, consumer satisfaction and content spamming. To address these challenges, methods for detecting generated lyrics are necessary. However, existing works have not yet focused on this specific modality or on creative text in general regarding machine-generated content detection methods and datasets. In response, we have curated the first dataset of high-quality synthetic lyrics and conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of various few-shot content detection approaches, testing their generalization capabilities and complementing this with a human evaluation. Our best few-shot detector, based on LLM2Vec, surpasses stylistic and statistical methods, which are shown competitive in other domains at distinguishing human-written from machine-generated content. It also shows good generalization capabilities to new artists and models, and effectively detects post-generation paraphrasing. This study emphasizes the need for further research on creative content detection, particularly in terms of generalization and scalability with larger song catalogs. All datasets, pre-processing scripts, and code are available publicly on GitHub and Hugging Face under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) emerges as a central challenge, aiming to convert audio signals into symbolic notations like musical notes or sheet music. This systematic review accentuates the pivotal role of AMT in music signal analysis, emphasizing its importance due to the intricate and overlapping spectral structure of musical harmonies. Through a thorough examination of existing machine learning techniques utilized in AMT, we explore the progress and constraints of current models and methodologies. Despite notable advancements, AMT systems have yet to match the accuracy of human experts, largely due to the complexities of musical harmonies and the need for nuanced interpretation. This review critically evaluates both fully automatic and semi-automatic AMT systems, emphasizing the importance of minimal user intervention and examining various methodologies proposed to date. By addressing the limitations of prior techniques and suggesting avenues for improvement, our objective is to steer future research towards fully automated AMT systems capable of accurately and efficiently translating intricate audio signals into precise symbolic representations.

<p>Abstract: The recent years have witnessed great advances in video generation. However, the development of automatic video metrics is lagging significantly behind. None of the existing metric is able to provide reliable scores over generated videos. The main barrier is the lack of large-scale human-annotated dataset. In this paper, we release VideoFeedback, the first large-scale dataset containing human-provided multi-aspect score over 37.6K synthesized videos from 11 existing video generative models. We train VideoScore (initialized from Mantis) based on VideoFeedback to enable automatic video quality assessment. Experiments show that the Spearman correlation between VideoScore and humans can reach 77.1 on VideoFeedback-test, beating the prior best metrics by about 50 points. Further result on other held-out EvalCrafter, GenAI-Bench, and VBench show that VideoScore has consistently much higher correlation with human judges than other metrics. Due to these results, we believe VideoScore can serve as a great proxy for human raters to (1) rate different video models to track progress (2) simulate fine-grained human feedback in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve current video generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Podo, Marco Angelini, Paola Velardi</p>
<p>Abstract: NL2VIS (natural language to visualization) is a promising and recent research area that involves interpreting natural language queries and translating them into visualizations that accurately represent the underlying data. As we navigate the era of big data, NL2VIS holds considerable application potential since it greatly facilitates data exploration by non-expert users. Following the increasingly widespread usage of generative AI in NL2VIS applications, in this paper we present V-RECS, the first LLM-based Visual Recommender augmented with explanations(E), captioning(C), and suggestions(S) for further data exploration. V-RECS' visualization narratives facilitate both response verification and data exploration by non-expert users. Furthermore, our proposed solution mitigates computational, controllability, and cost issues associated with using powerful LLMs by leveraging a methodology to effectively fine-tune small models. To generate insightful visualization narratives, we use Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT), a prompt engineering technique to help LLM identify and generate the logical steps to produce a correct answer. Since CoT is reported to perform poorly with small LLMs, we adopted a strategy in which a large LLM (GPT-4), acting as a Teacher, generates CoT-based instructions to fine-tune a small model, Llama-2-7B, which plays the role of a Student. Extensive experiments-based on a framework for the quantitative evaluation of AI-based visualizations and on manual assessment by a group of participants-show that V-RECS achieves performance scores comparable to GPT-4, at a much lower cost. The efficacy of the V-RECS teacher-student paradigm is also demonstrated by the fact that the un-tuned Llama fails to perform the task in the vast majority of test cases. We release V-RECS for the visualization community to assist visualization designers throughout the entire visualization generation process.</p>

To evaluate suitability of the grants, formal representations of their conditions are evaluated against properties of the business, taken from the registers of the Austrian public administration. The logical language for the representations of the grant conditions is based on S-expressions. We further describe a Proof of Concept implementation of reasoning over the formalised grant conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Li, Yichuan Mo, Mingjie Li, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The few-shot fine-tuning of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) has enabled them to grasp new concepts from a limited number of images. However, given the vast amount of personal images accessible online, this capability raises critical concerns about civil privacy. While several previous defense methods have been developed to prevent such misuse of LDMs, they typically assume that the textual prompts used by data protectors exactly match those employed by data exploiters. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that breaking this assumption, i.e., in cases where discrepancies exist between the textual conditions used by protectors and exploiters, could substantially reduce the effectiveness of these defenses. Furthermore, considering the visual encoder's independence from textual prompts, we delve into the visual encoder and thoroughly investigate how manipulating the visual encoder affects the few-shot fine-tuning process of LDMs. Drawing on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method called \textbf{Prompt-Independent Defense (PID)} to safeguard privacy against LDMs. We show that PID can act as a strong privacy shield on its own while requiring significantly less computational power. We believe our studies, along with the comprehensive understanding and new defense method, provide a notable advance toward reliable data protection against LDMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional RAG framework, the basic retrieval units are normally short. The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to extract answers from the short retrieved units. Such an imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light' reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. In order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG, consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. LongRAG processes the entire Wikipedia into 4K-token units, which is 30x longer than before. By increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total units from 22M to 700K. This significantly lowers the burden of retriever, which leads to a remarkable retrieval score: answer recall@1=71% on NQ (previously 52%) and answer recall@2=72% (previously 47%) on HotpotQA (full-wiki). Then we feed the top-k retrieved units ($\approx$ 30K tokens) to an existing long-context LLM to perform zero-shot answer extraction. Without requiring any training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ, which is the best known result. LongRAG also achieves 64.3% on HotpotQA (full-wiki), which is on par of the SoTA model. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: An end-to-end, segmentation-free, deep learning model trained from scratch is proposed, leveraging DCNN for feature extraction, alongside Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) for sequence recognition and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function on the KHATT database. The training phase yields remarkable results 84% recognition rate on the test dataset at the character level and 71% on the word level, establishing an image-based sequence recognition framework that operates without segmentation only at the line level. The analysis and preprocessing of the KFUPM Handwritten Arabic TexT (KHATT) database are also presented. Finally, advanced image processing techniques, including filtering, transformation, and line segmentation are implemented. The importance of this work is highlighted by its wide-ranging applications. Including digitizing, documentation, archiving, and text translation in fields such as banking. Moreover, AHR serves as a pivotal tool for making images searchable, enhancing information retrieval capabilities, and enabling effortless editing. This functionality significantly reduces the time and effort required for tasks such as Arabic data organization and manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Huang, Chancharik Mitra, Assaf Arbelle, Leonid Karlinsky, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of interleaved Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in few-shot learning suggests that in-context learning (ICL) with many examples can be promising for learning new tasks. However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV)--compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments suggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots and generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length for inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Filmmaking and animation production often require sophisticated techniques for coordinating camera transitions and object movements, typically involving labor-intensive real-world capturing. Despite advancements in generative AI for video creation, achieving precise control over motion for interactive video asset generation remains challenging. To this end, we propose Image Conductor, a method for precise control of camera transitions and object movements to generate video assets from a single image. An well-cultivated training strategy is proposed to separate distinct camera and object motion by camera LoRA weights and object LoRA weights. To further address cinematographic variations from ill-posed trajectories, we introduce a camera-free guidance technique during inference, enhancing object movements while eliminating camera transitions. Additionally, we develop a trajectory-oriented video motion data curation pipeline for training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate our method's precision and fine-grained control in generating motion-controllable videos from images, advancing the practical application of interactive video synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Liu, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automatic exploration of gene expression data, involving the tasks of dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide range of gene identification problems, in a full analysis pipeline that follows the standard of computational genomics. These annotations are curated by human bioinformaticians who carefully analyze the datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgents, a team of LLM-based agents designed with context-aware planning, iterative correction, and domain expert consultation to collaboratively explore gene datasets. Our experiments with GenoAgents demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches in genomics data analysis, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing AI-driven methods for genomics data analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhe Piao, Taiyu Zhu, Yu Wang, Stephanie E Baldeweg, Paul Taylor, Pantelis Georgiou, Jiahao Sun, Jun Wang, Kezhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients often struggle to obtain effective Blood Glucose (BG) prediction models due to the lack of sufficient BG data from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM), presenting a significant "cold start" problem in patient care. Utilizing population models to address this challenge is a potential solution, but collecting patient data for training population models in a privacy-conscious manner is challenging, especially given that such data is often stored on personal devices. Considering the privacy protection and addressing the "cold start" problem in diabetes care, we propose "GluADFL", blood Glucose prediction by Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning. We compared GluADFL with eight baseline methods using four distinct T1D datasets, comprising 298 participants, which demonstrated its superior performance in accurately predicting BG levels for cross-patient analysis. Furthermore, patients' data might be stored and shared across various communication networks in GluADFL, ranging from highly interconnected (e.g., random, performs the best among others) to more structured topologies (e.g., cluster and ring), suitable for various social networks. The asynchronous training framework supports flexible participation. By adjusting the ratios of inactive participants, we found it remains stable if less than 70% are inactive. Our results confirm that GluADFL offers a practical, privacy-preserving solution for BG prediction in T1D, significantly enhancing the quality of diabetes management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip R. Cohen, Lucian Galescu, Maayan Shvo</p>
<p>Abstract: Eva is a neuro-symbolic domain-independent multimodal collaborative dialogue system that takes seriously that the purpose of task-oriented dialogue is to assist the user. To do this, the system collaborates by inferring their intentions and plans, detects obstacles to success, finds plans to overcome them or to achieve higher-level goals, and plans its actions, including speech acts, to help users accomplish those goals. In doing so, the system maintains and reasons with its own declaratively-specified beliefs, goals and intentions, and explicitly reasons about those of its user. Because Eva can track different users' mental states, it can engage multiple agents in multi-party dialogues. Reasoning is accomplished with a modal Horn-clause meta-interpreter that enables computable inference within the subset of logic implemented. The system employs both hierarchical and backward-chaining planning, operating over a rich modal logic-based knowledge and action representation. The planning and reasoning subsystems obey the principles of persistent goals and intentions including: 1) The formation and decomposition of intentions to perform complex actions, 2) the conditions under which persistent goals and intentions can be given up, and 3) persistent goal and intention revision using the relativizing formulas that are created during the planning process. The system treats its speech acts just like its other actions. This general approach enables Eva to plan a variety of speech acts, including requests, informs, questions, confirmations, offers, acceptances, and emotive expressions. Because the dialogue engine is a planner, as the dialogue proceeds, the system can flexibly generate, execute, and potentially repair its plans using physical, digital, and speech actions. Importantly, Eva can explain its utterances because it has created a plan that caused it to utter them.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the utilization of LLMs for data preprocessing (DP), a crucial step in the data mining pipeline that transforms raw data into a clean format conducive to easy processing. Whereas the use of LLMs has sparked interest in devising universal solutions to DP, recent initiatives in this domain typically rely on GPT APIs, raising inevitable data breach concerns. Unlike these approaches, we consider instruction-tuning local LLMs (7 -- 13B models) as universal DP task solvers that operate on a local, single, and low-priced GPU, ensuring data security and enabling further customization. We select a collection of datasets across four representative DP tasks and construct instruction tuning data using data configuration, knowledge injection, and reasoning data distillation techniques tailored to DP. By tuning Mistral-7B, Llama 3-8B, and OpenOrca-Platypus2-13B, our models, namely, Jellyfish-7B/8B/13B, deliver competitiveness compared to GPT-3.5/4 models and strong generalizability to unseen tasks while barely compromising the base models' abilities in NLP tasks. Meanwhile, Jellyfish offers enhanced reasoning capabilities compared to GPT-3.5.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengxin Hong, Liang Xiao, Xin Zhang, Jianxia Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning. Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes. This leads to user distrust. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction. ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Discussion (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, use symbolic solver to identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision. We construct a formal model of ArgMed-Agents and present conjectures for theoretical guarantees. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach that equips LLM agents with introspection, enhancing consistency and adaptability in solving complex tasks. Our approach prompts LLM agents to decompose a given task into manageable subtasks (i.e., to make a plan), and to continuously introspect upon the suitability and results of their actions. %; and when necessary, to explore ``the road not taken.'' We implement a three-fold introspective intervention: 1) anticipatory reflection on potential failures and alternative remedy before action execution, 2) post-action alignment with subtask objectives and backtracking with remedy to ensure utmost effort in plan execution, and 3) comprehensive review upon plan completion for future strategy refinement. By deploying and experimenting with this methodology -- a zero-shot approach -- within WebArena for practical tasks in web environments, our agent demonstrates superior performance with a success rate of 23.5% over existing zero-shot methods by 3.5%. The experimental results suggest that our introspection-driven approach not only enhances the agent's ability to navigate unanticipated challenges through a robust mechanism of plan execution, but also improves efficiency by reducing the number of trials and plan revisions by 45% needed to achieve a task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqi Yan, Xuehai He, Xiang Yue, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), achieving high accuracy on existing benchmarks. However, their reliability under robust evaluation is questionable. This study reveals that when subjected to simple probing evaluation, state-of-the-art models perform worse than random guessing on medical diagnosis questions. To address this critical evaluation problem, we introduce the Probing Evaluation for Medical Diagnosis (ProbMed) dataset to rigorously assess LMM performance in medical imaging through probing evaluation and procedural diagnosis. Particularly, probing evaluation features pairing original questions with negation questions with hallucinated attributes, while procedural diagnosis requires reasoning across various diagnostic dimensions for each image, including modality recognition, organ identification, clinical findings, abnormalities, and positional grounding. Our evaluation reveals that top-performing models like GPT-4o, GPT-4V, and Gemini Pro perform worse than random guessing on specialized diagnostic questions, indicating significant limitations in handling fine-grained medical inquiries. Besides, models like LLaVA-Med struggle even with more general questions, and results from CheXagent demonstrate the transferability of expertise across different modalities of the same organ, showing that specialized domain knowledge is still crucial for improving performance. This study underscores the urgent need for more robust evaluation to ensure the reliability of LMMs in critical fields like medical diagnosis, and current LMMs are still far from applicable to those fields.</p>

This is because the number of hatched eggs may indicate that the sterile males are not competing with the wild ones. Nowadays, the study of the traps is done manually by microscope and is very time-consuming and prone to human error. This paper presents an automatic trap survey. For this purpose, a device has been designed that automatically scans the slat obtaining different overlapping photos. Subsequently, the images are analyzed by a Mask-RCNN neural network that segments the eggs and classifies them into 2 classes: full or hatch</p>

Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are reduced by 78.12\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\%. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current major methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengjin Xu, Muzhi Li, Cehao Yang, Xuhui Jiang, Lumingyuan Tang, Yiyan Qi, Jian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are foundational structures in many AI applications, representing entities and their interrelations through triples. However, triple-based KGs lack the contextual information of relational knowledge, like temporal dynamics and provenance details, which are crucial for comprehensive knowledge representation and effective reasoning. Instead, \textbf{Contextual Knowledge Graphs} (CKGs) expand upon the conventional structure by incorporating additional information such as time validity, geographic location, and source provenance. This integration provides a more nuanced and accurate understanding of knowledge, enabling KGs to offer richer insights and support more sophisticated reasoning processes. In this work, we first discuss the inherent limitations of triple-based KGs and introduce the concept of contextual KGs, highlighting their advantages in knowledge representation and reasoning. We then present \textbf{KGR$^3$, a context-enriched KG reasoning paradigm} that leverages large language models (LLMs) to retrieve candidate entities and related contexts, rank them based on the retrieved information, and reason whether sufficient information has been obtained to answer a query. Our experimental results demonstrate that KGR$^3$ significantly improves performance on KG completion (KGC) and KG question answering (KGQA) tasks, validating the effectiveness of incorporating contextual information on KG representation and reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Aghzal, Erion Plaku, Ziyu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide variety of tasks. However, they still face challenges with long-horizon planning. To study this, we propose path planning tasks as a platform to evaluate LLMs' ability to navigate long trajectories under geometric constraints. Our proposed benchmark systematically tests path-planning skills in complex settings. Using this, we examined GPT-4's planning abilities using various task representations and prompting approaches. We found that framing prompts as Python code and decomposing long trajectory tasks improve GPT-4's path planning effectiveness. However, while these approaches show some promise toward improving the planning ability of the model, they do not obtain optimal paths and fail at generalizing over extended horizons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitri Iourovitski</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces the "Grade Score", a novel metric designed to evaluate the consistency and fairness of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as multiple-choice judges with respect to order bias and choice consistency. The Grade Score combines Entropy, which measures order bias, and Mode Frequency, which assesses choice stability, offering insights into LLMs' reliability and impartiality. The study explores techniques such as prompt engineering and option sampling strategies to optimize the Grade Score, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' performance. Results showcase varying performances among LLMs with respect to prompts and highlight the positive impact of including irrelevant options. The study also identifies an emergent behavior in instruction-following models, where they adapt to instructions targeting specific biases, demonstrating their adaptability. The Grade Score facilitates comparisons between LLMs and encourages ongoing research towards optimizing their decision-making processes, with potential implications for improving their reliability and fairness in various applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Abdeen Hamed, Tamer E. Fandy</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of this research is to introduce a network specialized in predicting drugs that can be repurposed by investigating real-world evidence sources, such as clinical trials and biomedical literature. Specifically, it aims to generate drug combination therapies for complex diseases (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer's). We present a multilayered network medicine approach, empowered by a highly configured ChatGPT prompt engineering system, which is constructed on the fly to extract drug mentions in clinical trials. Additionally, we introduce a novel algorithm that connects real-world evidence with disease-specific signaling pathways (e.g., KEGG database). This sheds light on the repurposability of drugs if they are found to bind with one or more protein constituents of a signaling pathway. To demonstrate, we instantiated the framework for breast cancer and found that, out of 46 breast cancer signaling pathways, the framework identified 38 pathways that were covered by at least two drugs. This evidence signals the potential for combining those drugs. Specifically, the most covered signaling pathway, ID hsa:2064, was covered by 108 drugs, some of which can be combined. Conversely, the signaling pathway ID hsa:1499 was covered by only two drugs, indicating a significant gap for further research. Our network medicine framework, empowered by GenAI, shows promise in identifying drug combinations with a high degree of specificity, knowing the exact signaling pathways and proteins that serve as targets. It is noteworthy that ChatGPT successfully accelerated the process of identifying drug mentions in clinical trials, though further investigations are required to determine the relationships among the drug mentions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative, multimodal artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers transformative potential across industries, but its misuse poses significant risks. Prior research has shed light on the potential of advanced AI systems to be exploited for malicious purposes. However, we still lack a concrete understanding of how GenAI models are specifically exploited or abused in practice, including the tactics employed to inflict harm. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of GenAI misuse tactics, informed by existing academic literature and a qualitative analysis of approximately 200 observed incidents of misuse reported between January 2023 and March 2024. Through this analysis, we illuminate key and novel patterns in misuse during this time period, including potential motivations, strategies, and how attackers leverage and abuse system capabilities across modalities (e.g. image, text, audio, video) in the wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Jionghao Lin, Ziyi Kuang, Sheng Xu, Mohammed Yeasin, Xiangen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have significantly advanced adaptive and personalized learning by automating sophisticated human tutoring strategies within interactive dialogues. However, replicating the nuanced patterns of expert human communication remains a challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recent advancements in NLP, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4, offer promising solutions by providing human-like and context-aware responses based on extensive pre-trained knowledge. Motivated by the effectiveness of LLMs in various educational tasks (e.g., content creation and summarization, problem-solving, and automated feedback provision), our study introduces the Socratic Playground for Learning (SPL), a dialogue-based ITS powered by the GPT-4 model, which employs the Socratic teaching method to foster critical thinking among learners. Through extensive prompt engineering, SPL can generate specific learning scenarios and facilitates efficient multi-turn tutoring dialogues. The SPL system aims to enhance personalized and adaptive learning experiences tailored to individual needs, specifically focusing on improving critical thinking skills. Our pilot experimental results from essay writing tasks demonstrate SPL has the potential to improve tutoring interactions and further enhance dialogue-based ITS functionalities. Our study, exemplified by SPL, demonstrates how LLMs enhance dialogue-based ITSs and expand the accessibility and efficacy of educational technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compute-efficient training of large language models (LLMs) has become an important research problem. In this work, we consider data pruning as a method of data-efficient training of LLMs, where we take a data compression view on data pruning. We argue that the amount of information of a sample, or the achievable compression on its description length, represents its sample importance. The key idea is that, less informative samples are likely to contain redundant information, and thus should be pruned first. We leverage log-likelihood function of trained models as a surrogate to measure information content of samples. Experiments reveal a surprising insight that information-based pruning can enhance the generalization capability of the model, improves upon language modeling and downstream tasks as compared to the model trained on the entire dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Ao, Simon Khan, Haris Aziz, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the agent's learning process, particularly the factors that contribute to its success or failure post-training, is crucial for comprehending the rationale behind the agent's decision-making process. Prior methods clarify the learning process by creating a structural causal model (SCM) or visually representing the distribution of value functions. Nevertheless, these approaches have constraints as they exclusively function in 2D-environments or with uncomplicated transition dynamics. Understanding the agent's learning process in complicated environments or tasks is more challenging. In this paper, we propose REVEAL-IT, a novel framework for explaining the learning process of an agent in complex environments. Initially, we visualize the policy structure and the agent's learning process for various training tasks. By visualizing these findings, we can understand how much a particular training task or stage affects the agent's performance in test. Then, a GNN-based explainer learns to highlight the most important section of the policy, providing a more clear and robust explanation of the agent's learning process.

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in workplaces stands to change the way humans work, with job satisfaction intrinsically linked to work life. Existing research on human-AI collaboration tends to prioritize performance over the experiential aspects of work. In contrast, this paper explores the impact of AI on job decency and meaningfulness in workplaces. Through interviews in the Information Technology (IT) domain, we not only examined the current work environment, but also explored the perceived evolution of the workplace ecosystem with the introduction of an AI. Findings from the preliminary exploratory study reveal that respondents tend to visualize a workplace where humans continue to play a dominant role, even with the introduction of advanced AIs. In this prospective scenario, AI is seen as serving as a complement rather than replacing the human workforce. Furthermore, respondents believe that the introduction of AI will maintain or potentially increase overall job satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Lin, Qingxing Cao, Yinya Huang, Haiming Wang, Jianqiao Lu, Zhengying Liu, Linqi Song, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal verification (FV) has witnessed growing significance with current emerging program synthesis by the evolving large language models (LLMs). However, current formal verification mainly resorts to symbolic verifiers or hand-craft rules, resulting in limitations for extensive and flexible verification. On the other hand, formal languages for automated theorem proving, such as Isabelle, as another line of rigorous verification, are maintained with comprehensive rules and theorems. In this paper, we propose FVEL, an interactive Formal Verification Environment with LLMs. Specifically, FVEL transforms a given code to be verified into Isabelle, and then conducts verification via neural automated theorem proving with an LLM. The joined paradigm leverages the rigorous yet abundant formulated and organized rules in Isabelle and is also convenient for introducing and adjusting cutting-edge LLMs. To achieve this goal, we extract a large-scale FVELER3. The FVELER dataset includes code dependencies and verification processes that are formulated in Isabelle, containing 758 theories, 29,125 lemmas, and 200,646 proof steps in total with in-depth dependencies. We benchmark FVELER in the FVEL environment by first fine-tuning LLMs with FVELER and then evaluating them on Code2Inv and SV-COMP. The results show that FVEL with FVELER fine-tuned Llama3- 8B solves 17.39% (69 -> 81) more problems, and Mistral-7B 12% (75 -> 84) more problems in SV-COMP. And the proportion of proof errors is reduced. Project page: https://fveler.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akira Taniguchi, Shuya Ito, Tadahiro Taniguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Assisting individuals in their daily activities through autonomous mobile robots, especially for users without specialized knowledge, is crucial. Specifically, the capability of robots to navigate to destinations based on human speech instructions is essential. While robots can take different paths to the same goal, the shortest path is not always the best. A preferred approach is to accommodate waypoint specifications flexibly, planning an improved alternative path, even with detours. Additionally, robots require real-time inference capabilities. This study aimed to realize a hierarchical spatial representation using a topometric semantic map and path planning with speech instructions, including waypoints. This paper presents Spatial Concept-based Topometric Semantic Mapping for Hierarchical Path Planning (SpCoTMHP), integrating place connectivity. This approach offers a novel integrated probabilistic generative model and fast approximate inference across hierarchy levels. A formulation based on control as probabilistic inference theoretically supports the proposed path planning algorithm. We conducted experiments in home environments using the Toyota Human Support Robot on the SIGVerse simulator and in a lab-office environment with the real robot, Albert. Users issued speech commands specifying the waypoint and goal, such as "Go to the bedroom via the corridor." Navigation experiments using speech instructions with a waypoint demonstrated a performance improvement of SpCoTMHP over the baseline hierarchical path planning method with heuristic path costs (HPP-I), in terms of the weighted success rate at which the robot reaches the closest target and passes the correct waypoints, by 0.590. The computation time was significantly accelerated by 7.14 seconds with SpCoTMHP compared to baseline HPP-I in advanced tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaros{\l}aw Paw{\l}owski, Mateusz Krawczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property commonly used in various quantum information protocols and algorithms. Nonetheless, the problem of identifying entanglement has still not reached a general solution for systems larger than $2\times3$. In this study, we use deep convolutional NNs, a type of supervised machine learning, to identify quantum entanglement for any bipartition in a 3-qubit system. We demonstrate that training the model on synthetically generated datasets of random density matrices excluding challenging positive-under-partial-transposition entangled states (PPTES), which cannot be identified (and correctly labeled) in general, leads to good model accuracy even for PPTES states, that were outside the training data. Our aim is to enhance the model's generalization on PPTES. By applying entanglement-preserving symmetry operations through a triple Siamese network trained in a semi-supervised manner, we improve the model's accuracy and ability to recognize PPTES. Moreover, by constructing an ensemble of Siamese models, even better generalization is observed, in analogy with the idea of finding separate types of entanglement witnesses for different classes of states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Li, Xiuxing Li, Sunqi Fan, Jianyong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured tabular data is a fundamental data type in numerous fields, and the capacity to reason over tables is crucial for answering questions and validating hypotheses. However, constructing labeled data for complex reasoning tasks is labor intensive, and the quantity of annotated data remains insufficient to support the intricate demands of real-world applications. To address the insufficient annotation challenge, we present a self-training framework for unsupervised complex tabular reasoning (UCTR-ST) by generating diverse synthetic data with complex logic. Specifically, UCTR-ST incorporates several essential techniques: we aggregate diverse programs and execute them on tables based on a "Program-Management" component, and we bridge the gap between programs and text with a powerful "Program-Transformation" module that generates natural language sentences with complex logic. Furthermore, we optimize the procedure using a "Table-Text Manipulator" to handle joint table-text reasoning scenarios. The entire framework utilizes self-training techniques to leverage the unlabeled training data, which results in significant performance improvements when tested on real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that UCTRST achieves above 90% of the supervised model performance on different tasks and domains, reducing the dependence on manual annotation. Additionally, our approach can serve as a data augmentation technique, significantly boosting the performance of supervised models in low-resourced domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: The {\it straight-through estimator} (STE) is commonly used to optimize quantized neural networks, yet its contexts of effective performance are still unclear despite empirical successes.To make a step forward in this comprehension, we apply STE to a well-understood problem: {\it sparse support recovery}. We introduce the {\it Support Exploration Algorithm} (SEA), a novel algorithm promoting sparsity, and we analyze its performance in support recovery (a.k.a. model selection) problems. SEA explores more supports than the state-of-the-art, leading to superior performance in experiments, especially when the columns of $A$ are strongly coherent.The theoretical analysis considers recovery guarantees when the linear measurements matrix $A$ satisfies the {\it Restricted Isometry Property} (RIP).The sufficient conditions of recovery are comparable but more stringent than those of the state-of-the-art in sparse support recovery. Their significance lies mainly in their applicability to an instance of the STE.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of understanding their knowledge and uncertainty over questions. Specifically, we focus on addressing known-unknown questions, characterized by high uncertainty due to the absence of definitive answers. To facilitate our study, we collect a new dataset with Known-Unknown Questions (KUQ) and establish a categorization framework to clarify the origins of uncertainty in such queries. Subsequently, we examine the performance of open-source LLMs, fine-tuned using this dataset, in distinguishing between known and unknown queries within open-ended question-answering scenarios. The fine-tuned models demonstrated a significant improvement, achieving a considerable increase in F1-score relative to their pre-fine-tuning state. Through a comprehensive analysis, we reveal insights into the models' improved uncertainty articulation and their consequent efficacy in multi-agent debates. These findings help us understand how LLMs can be trained to identify and express uncertainty, improving our knowledge of how they understand and express complex or unclear information.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces FedSecurity, an end-to-end benchmark that serves as a supplementary component of the FedML library for simulating adversarial attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms in Federated Learning (FL). FedSecurity eliminates the need for implementing the fundamental FL procedures, e.g., FL training and data loading, from scratch, thus enables users to focus on developing their own attack and defense strategies. It contains two key components, including FedAttacker that conducts a variety of attacks during FL training, and FedDefender that implements defensive mechanisms to counteract these attacks. FedSecurity has the following features: i) It offers extensive customization options to accommodate a broad range of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ResNet, and GAN) and FL optimizers (e.g., FedAVG, FedOPT, and FedNOVA); ii) it enables exploring the effectiveness of attacks and defenses across different datasets and models; and iii) it supports flexible configuration and customization through a configuration file and some APIs. We further demonstrate FedSecurity's utility and adaptability through federated training of Large Language Models (LLMs) to showcase its potential on a wide range of complex applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiping Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: A good theory of mathematical beauty is more practical than any current observation, as new predictions of physical reality can be verified self-consistently. This belief applies to the current status of understanding deep neural networks including large language models and even the biological intelligence. Toy models provide a metaphor of physical reality, allowing mathematically formulating that reality (i.e., the so-called theory), which can be updated as more conjectures are justified or refuted. One does not need to pack all details into a model, but rather, more abstract models are constructed, as complex systems like brains or deep networks have many sloppy dimensions but much less stiff dimensions that strongly impact macroscopic observables. This kind of bottom-up mechanistic modeling is still promising in the modern era of understanding the natural or artificial intelligence. Here, we shed light on eight challenges in developing theory of intelligence following this theoretical paradigm. Theses challenges are representation learning, generalization, adversarial robustness, continual learning, causal learning, internal model of the brain, next-token prediction, and finally the mechanics of subjective experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuming Huang, Bin Ren, Ziming Xu, Lianghong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse rewards pose a significant challenge to achieving high sample efficiency in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, in sequential manipulation tasks, the agent receives failure rewards until it successfully completes the entire manipulation task, which leads to low sample efficiency. To tackle this issue and improve sample efficiency, we propose a novel model-based RL framework called Model-based Relay Hindsight Experience Replay (MRHER). MRHER breaks down a continuous task into subtasks with increasing complexity and utilizes the previous subtask to guide the learning of the subsequent one. Instead of using Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) in every subtask, we design a new robust model-based relabeling method called Foresight relabeling (FR). FR predicts the future trajectory of the hindsight state and relabels the expected goal as a goal achieved on the virtual future trajectory. By incorporating FR, MRHER effectively captures more information from historical experiences, leading to improved sample efficiency, particularly in object-manipulation environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MRHER exhibits state-of-the-art sample efficiency in benchmark tasks, outperforming RHER by 13.79% and 14.29% in the FetchPush-v1 environment and FetchPickandPlace-v1 environment, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ever-growing complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks demands a distributed system to efficiently generate and process a massive amount of data. However, existing open-source libraries suffer from various limitations, which impede their practical use in challenging scenarios where large-scale training is necessary. In this paper, we present a novel abstraction on the dataflows of RL training, which unifies diverse RL training applications into a general framework. Following this abstraction, we develop a scalable, efficient, and extensible distributed RL system called ReaLlyScalableRL, which allows efficient and massively parallelized training and easy development of customized algorithms. Our evaluation shows that SRL outperforms existing academic libraries, reaching at most 21x higher training throughput in a distributed setting. On learning performance, beyond performing and scaling well on common RL benchmarks with different RL algorithms, SRL can reproduce the same solution in the challenging hide-and-seek environment as reported by OpenAI with up to 5x speedup in wall-clock time. Notably, SRL is the first in the academic community to perform RL experiments at a large scale with over 15k CPU cores. SRL source code is available at: https://github.com/openpsi-project/srl .</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown significant benefits in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, reducing reliance on domain expertise, and improving computational efficiency. However, the field lacks a unified benchmark for easy development and standardized comparison of algorithms across diverse CO problems. To fill this gap, we introduce RL4CO, a unified and extensive benchmark with in-depth library coverage of 23 state-of-the-art methods and more than 20 CO problems. Built on efficient software libraries and best practices in implementation, RL4CO features modularized implementation and flexible configuration of diverse RL algorithms, neural network architectures, inference techniques, and environments. RL4CO allows researchers to seamlessly navigate existing successes and develop their unique designs, facilitating the entire research process by decoupling science from heavy engineering. We also provide extensive benchmark studies to inspire new insights and future work. RL4CO has attracted numerous researchers in the community and is open-sourced at https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marin Vlastelica, Jin Cheng, Georg Martius, Pavel Kolev</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in the area of unsupervised skill discovery, utilizing various information-theoretic objectives as measures of diversity. Despite these advances, challenges remain: current methods require significant online interaction, fail to leverage vast amounts of available task-agnostic data and typically lack a quantitative measure of skill utility. We address these challenges by proposing a principled offline algorithm for unsupervised skill discovery that, in addition to maximizing diversity, ensures that each learned skill imitates state-only expert demonstrations to a certain degree. Our main analytical contribution is to connect Fenchel duality, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised skill discovery to maximize a mutual information objective subject to KL-divergence state occupancy constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the standard offline benchmark D4RL and on a custom offline dataset collected from a 12-DoF quadruped robot for which the policies trained in simulation transfer well to the real robotic system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowei Gao, Xinke Jiang, Dingyi Zhuang, Huanfa Chen, Shenhao Wang, Stephen Law, James Haworth</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic accidents present substantial challenges to human safety and socioeconomic development in urban areas. Developing a reliable and responsible traffic accident prediction model is crucial to addressing growing public safety concerns and enhancing the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of highrisk accidents and the predominance of nonaccident characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of accidents, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of accident risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal ZeroInflated Tweedie Graph Neural Network ,STZITDGNN, the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in roadlevel traffic accident prediction for multi-steps. This model integrates the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family model and the expressive power of graph neural networks. Its decoder innovatively employs a compound Tweedie model, a Poisson distribution to model the frequency of accident occurrences and a Gamma distribution to assess injury severity, supplemented by a zeroinflated component to effectively identify exessive non-incident instances. Empirical tests using realworld traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITDGNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks and metrics, including accident risk value prediction, uncertainty minimisation, nonaccident road identification and accident occurrence accuracy. Our study demonstrates that STZTIDGNN can effectively inform targeted road monitoring, thereby improving urban road safety strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timm Hess, Tinne Tuytelaars, Gido M. van de Ven</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen considerable progress in the continual training of deep neural networks, predominantly thanks to approaches that add replay or regularization terms to the loss function to approximate the joint loss over all tasks so far. However, we show that even with a perfect approximation to the joint loss, these approaches still suffer from temporary but substantial forgetting when starting to train on a new task. Motivated by this 'stability gap', we propose that continual learning strategies should focus not only on the optimization objective, but also on the way this objective is optimized. While there is some continual learning work that alters the optimization trajectory (e.g., using gradient projection techniques), this line of research is positioned as alternative to improving the optimization objective, while we argue it should be complementary. In search of empirical support for our proposition, we perform a series of pre-registered experiments combining replay-approximated joint objectives with gradient projection-based optimization routines. However, this first experimental attempt fails to show clear and consistent benefits. Nevertheless, our conceptual arguments, as well as some of our empirical results, demonstrate the distinctive importance of the optimization trajectory in continual learning, thereby opening up a new direction for continual learning research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexej Brauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, there is a lot of research in the field of neural networks for non-life insurance pricing. The usual goal is to improve the predictive power via neural networks while building upon the generalized linear model, which is the current industry standard. Our paper contributes to this current journey via novel methods to enhance actuarial non-life models with transformer models for tabular data. We build here upon the foundation laid out by the combined actuarial neural network as well as the localGLMnet and enhance those models via the feature tokenizer transformer. The manuscript demonstrates the performance of the proposed methods on a real-world claim frequency dataset and compares them with several benchmark models such as generalized linear models, feed-forward neural networks, combined actuarial neural networks, LocalGLMnet, and pure feature tokenizer transformer. The paper shows that the new methods can achieve better results than the benchmark models while preserving certain generalized linear model advantages. The paper also discusses the practical implications and challenges of applying transformer models in actuarial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Ranaldi, Giulia Pucci, Federico Ranaldi, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning methods, best exemplified by the well-known Chain-of-Thought (CoT), empower the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by eliciting them to solve complex tasks in a step-by-step manner. Although they are achieving significant success, the ability to deliver multi-step reasoning remains limited to English because of the imbalance in the distribution of pre-training data, which makes other languages a barrier. In this paper, we propose Cross-lingual Tree-of-Thoughts (Cross-ToT), a method for aligning Cross-lingual CoT reasoning across languages. The proposed method, through a self-consistent cross-lingual prompting mechanism inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts approach, provides multi-step reasoning paths in different languages that, during the steps, lead to the final solution. Experimental evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms existing prompting methods by reducing the number of interactions and achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengjia Xiao, Peng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This research focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with (path) planning for mobile embodied agents such as robots, in a human-in-the-loop and interactive manner. A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binggui Zhou, Xi Yang, Jintao Wang, Shaodan Ma, Feifei Gao, Guanghua Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for downlink precoding in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). However, obtaining CSI through feedback from the user equipment (UE) becomes challenging with the increasing scale of antennas and subcarriers and leads to extremely high CSI feedback overhead. Deep learning-based methods have emerged for compressing CSI but these methods generally require substantial collected samples and thus pose practical challenges. Moreover, existing deep learning methods also suffer from dramatically growing feedback overhead owing to their focus on full-dimensional CSI feedback. To address these issues, we propose a low-overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF) for massive MIMO systems. An incorporation-extrapolation scheme for eigenvector-based CSI feedback is proposed to reduce the feedback overhead. Then, to alleviate the necessity of extensive collected samples and enable few-shot CSI feedback, we further propose a knowledge-driven data augmentation (KDDA) method and an artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) -based data augmentation method by exploiting the domain knowledge of wireless channels and by exploiting a novel generative model, respectively. Experimental results based on the DeepMIMO dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEFSF significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead by 64 times compared with existing methods while maintaining higher feedback accuracy using only several hundred collected samples.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of CPRP, concept prerequisite relation prediction, which is a fundamental task in using AI for education. CPRP is usually formulated into a link-prediction task on a relationship graph of concepts and solved by training the graph neural network (GNN) model. However, current directed GNNs fail to manage graph isomorphism which refers to the invariance of non-isomorphic graphs, reducing the expressivity of resulting representations. We present a permutation-equivariant directed GNN model by introducing the Weisfeiler-Lehman test into directed GNN learning. Our method is then used for CPRP and evaluated on three public datasets. The experimental results show that our model delivers better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Dahl, Varun Magesh, Mirac Suzgun, Daniel E. Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) know the law? These models are increasingly being used to augment legal practice, education, and research, yet their revolutionary potential is threatened by the presence of hallucinations -- textual output that is not consistent with legal facts. We present the first systematic evidence of these hallucinations, documenting LLMs' varying performance across jurisdictions, courts, time periods, and cases. Our work makes four key contributions. First, we develop a typology of legal hallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future research in this area. Second, we find that legal hallucinations are alarmingly prevalent, occurring between 58% of the time with ChatGPT 4 and 88% with Llama 2, when these models are asked specific, verifiable questions about random federal court cases. Third, we illustrate that LLMs often fail to correct a user's incorrect legal assumptions in a contra-factual question setup. Fourth, we provide evidence that LLMs cannot always predict, or do not always know, when they are producing legal hallucinations. Taken together, our findings caution against the rapid and unsupervised integration of popular LLMs into legal tasks. Even experienced lawyers must remain wary of legal hallucinations, and the risks are highest for those who stand to benefit from LLMs the most -- pro se litigants or those without access to traditional legal resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Zheng, Wei Deng, Christian Moya, Guang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Approximate Thompson sampling with Langevin Monte Carlo broadens its reach from Gaussian posterior sampling to encompass more general smooth posteriors. However, it still encounters scalability issues in high-dimensional problems when demanding high accuracy. To address this, we propose an approximate Thompson sampling strategy, utilizing underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, where the latter is the go-to workhorse for simulations of high-dimensional posteriors. Based on the standard smoothness and log-concavity conditions, we study the accelerated posterior concentration and sampling using a specific potential function. This design improves the sample complexity for realizing logarithmic regrets from $\mathcal{\tilde O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{\tilde O}(\sqrt{d})$. The scalability and robustness of our algorithm are also empirically validated through synthetic experiments in high-dimensional bandit problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot tasks, including time-series forecasting. However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models. We study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest. Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wang, Alfonso Amayuelas, Kexun Zhang, Liangming Pan, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained language models (LMs) are able to perform complex reasoning without explicit fine-tuning. To understand how pre-training with a next-token prediction objective contributes to the emergence of such reasoning capability, we propose that we can view an LM as deriving new conclusions by aggregating indirect reasoning paths seen at pre-training time. We found this perspective effective in two important cases of reasoning: logic reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. More specifically, we formalize the reasoning paths as random walk paths on the knowledge/reasoning graphs. Analyses of learned LM distributions suggest that a weighted sum of relevant random walk path probabilities is a reasonable way to explain how LMs reason. Experiments and analysis on multiple KG and CoT datasets reveal the effect of training on random walk paths and suggest that augmenting unlabeled random walk reasoning paths can improve real-world multi-step reasoning performance. code: https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/LM_random_walk</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Wan, Yufei Wang, Zackory Erickson, David Held</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTOP, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory OPtimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep reinforcement and imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTOP addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTOP is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTOP for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTOP outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Bentham, Nathan Stringham, Ana Marasovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the extent to which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generations align with a large language model's (LLM) internal computations is critical for deciding whether to trust an LLM's output. As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models. This normalized faithfulness metric is also strongly correlated ($R^2$=0.74) with accuracy, raising doubts about its validity for evaluating faithfulness.</p>

We are the first to show, under general regularity assumptions, that such decision rules converge uniformly to the smallest possible uncertainty obtainable from the accessible data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaopeng Feng, Yan Zhang, Hao Li, Bei Wu, Jiayu Liao, Wenqiang Liu, Jun Lang, Yang Feng, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in Machine Translation (MT). However, careful evaluations by human reveal that the translations produced by LLMs still contain multiple errors. Importantly, feeding back such error information into the LLMs can lead to self-refinement and result in improved translation performance. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a systematic LLM-based self-refinement translation framework, named \textbf{TEaR}, which stands for \textbf{T}ranslate, \textbf{E}stimate, \textbf{a}nd \textbf{R}efine, marking a significant step forward in this direction. Our findings demonstrate that 1) our self-refinement framework successfully assists LLMs in improving their translation quality across a wide range of languages, whether it's from high-resource languages to low-resource ones or whether it's English-centric or centered around other languages; 2) TEaR exhibits superior systematicity and interpretability; 3) different estimation strategies yield varied impacts, directly affecting the effectiveness of the final corrections. Additionally, traditional neural translation models and evaluation models operate separately, often focusing on singular tasks due to their limited capabilities, while general-purpose LLMs possess the capability to undertake both tasks simultaneously. We further conduct cross-model correction experiments to investigate the potential relationship between the translation and evaluation capabilities of general-purpose LLMs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/fzp0424/self_correct_mt</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves pre-trained models by incorporating external knowledge at test time to enable customized adaptation. We study the risk of datastore leakage in Retrieval-In-Context RAG Language Models (LMs). We show that an adversary can exploit LMs' instruction-following capabilities to easily extract text data verbatim from the datastore of RAG systems built with instruction-tuned LMs via prompt injection. The vulnerability exists for a wide range of modern LMs that span Llama2, Mistral/Mixtral, Vicuna, SOLAR, WizardLM, Qwen1.5, and Platypus2, and the exploitability exacerbates as the model size scales up. Extending our study to production RAG models GPTs, we design an attack that can cause datastore leakage with a 100% success rate on 25 randomly selected customized GPTs with at most 2 queries, and we extract text data verbatim at a rate of 41% from a book of 77,000 words and 3% from a corpus of 1,569,000 words by prompting the GPTs with only 100 queries generated by themselves.</p>

We benchmark LLMs on an existing human dataset and show that current LLMs display an impressive ability to 'unfun' jokes, as judged by humans and as measured on the downstream task of humor detection. We extend our approach to a code-mixed English-Hindi humor dataset, where we find that GPT-4's synthetic data is highly rated by bilingual annotators and provides challenging adversarial examples for humor classifiers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. To evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs were confident in their predictions, they were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where humans and LLMs team together to make discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience-specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor Carrara, Bruno Aristimunha, Marie-Constance Corsi, Raphael Y. de Camargo, Sylvain Chevallier, Th\'eodore Papadopoulo</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on brain signal analysis is still in its nascent stages compared to their success in fields like Computer Vision, especially in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where the brain activity is decoded to control external devices without requiring muscle control. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely adopted choice for designing BCI systems due to its non-invasive and cost-effective nature and excellent temporal resolution. Still, it comes at the expense of limited training data, poor signal-to-noise, and a large variability across and within-subject recordings. Finally, setting up a BCI system with many electrodes takes a long time, hindering the widespread adoption of reliable DL architectures in BCIs outside research laboratories. To improve adoption, we need to improve user comfort using, for instance, reliable algorithms that operate with few electrodes. Approach: Our research aims to develop a DL algorithm that delivers effective results with a limited number of electrodes. Taking advantage of the Augmented Covariance Method with SPDNet, we propose the SPDNet$_{\psi}$ architecture and analyze its performance and computational impact, as well as the interpretability of the results. The evaluation is conducted on 5-fold cross-validation, using only three electrodes positioned above the Motor Cortex. The methodology was tested on nearly 100 subjects from several open-source datasets using the Mother Of All BCI Benchmark (MOABB) framework. Main results: The results of our SPDNet$_{\psi}$ demonstrate that the augmented approach combined with the SPDNet significantly outperforms all the current state-of-the-art DL architecture in MI decoding. Significance: This new architecture is explainable, with a low number of trainable parameters and a reduced carbon footprint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Ali Labbaf-Khaniki, Mohammad Manthouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a crucial task for ensuring the safety and efficiency of industrial processes. We propose a novel FDD methodology for the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), a widely used benchmark for chemical process control. The model employs two separate Transformer branches, enabling independent processing of input data and potential extraction of diverse information. A novel attention mechanism, Gated Dynamic Learnable Attention (GDLAttention), is introduced which integrates a gating mechanism and dynamic learning capabilities. The gating mechanism modulates the attention weights, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input. The dynamic learning approach adapts the attention strategy during training, potentially leading to improved performance. The attention mechanism uses a bilinear similarity function, providing greater flexibility in capturing complex relationships between query and key vectors. In order to assess the effectiveness of our approach, we tested it against 21 and 18 distinct fault scenarios in TEP, and compared its performance with several established FDD techniques. The outcomes indicate that the method outperforms others in terms of accuracy, false alarm rate, and misclassification rate. This underscores the robustness and efficacy of the approach for FDD in intricate industrial processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Tabrizian, Zhitong Huang, Peng Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenging problem of autonomous on-ramp merging, where a self-driving vehicle needs to seamlessly integrate into a flow of vehicles on a multi-lane highway. We introduce the Lane-keeping, Lane-changing with Latent-state Inference and Safety Controller (L3IS) agent, designed to perform the on-ramp merging task safely without comprehensive knowledge about surrounding vehicles' intents or driving styles. We also present an augmentation of this agent called AL3IS that accounts for observation delays, allowing the agent to make more robust decisions in real-world environments with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delays. By modeling the unobservable aspects of the environment through latent states, such as other drivers' intents, our approach enhances the agent's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions, optimize merging maneuvers, and ensure safe interactions with other vehicles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulations generated from real traffic data and compare its performance with existing approaches. L3IS shows a 99.90% success rate in a challenging on-ramp merging case generated from the real US Highway 101 data. We further perform a sensitivity analysis on AL3IS to evaluate its robustness against varying observation delays, which demonstrates an acceptable performance of 93.84% success rate in 1-second V2V communication delay.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxi Hu, Amartya Sanyal, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: When analysing Differentially Private (DP) machine learning pipelines, the potential privacy cost of data-dependent pre-processing is frequently overlooked in privacy accounting. In this work, we propose a general framework to evaluate the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private data-dependent pre-processing algorithms. Our framework establishes upper bounds on the overall privacy guarantees by utilising two new technical notions: a variant of DP termed Smooth DP and the bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing algorithms. In addition to the generic framework, we provide explicit overall privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent pre-processing algorithms, such as data imputation, quantization, deduplication and PCA, when used in combination with several DP algorithms. Notably, this framework is also simple to implement, allowing direct integration into existing DP pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junho Kim, Yeon Ju Kim, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a way of enhancing the reliability of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) in addressing hallucination, where the models generate cross-modal inconsistent responses. Without additional training, we propose Counterfactual Inception, a novel method that implants counterfactual thinking into LMMs using self-generated counterfactual keywords. Our method is grounded in the concept of counterfactual thinking, a cognitive process where human considers alternative realities, enabling more extensive context exploration. Bridging the human cognition mechanism into LMMs, we aim for the models to engage with and generate responses that span a wider contextual scene understanding, mitigating hallucinatory outputs. We further introduce Plausibility Verification Process (PVP), a simple yet robust keyword constraint that effectively filters out sub-optimal keywords to enable the consistent triggering of counterfactual thinking in the model responses. Comprehensive analyses across various LMMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, corroborate that counterfactual thinking significantly reduces hallucination and helps to broaden contextual understanding based on true visual clues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Janmohamed, Marta Wolinska, Shikha Surana, Thomas Pierrot, Aron Walsh, Antoine Cully</p>
<p>Abstract: Crystal structures are indispensable across various domains, from batteries to solar cells, and extensive research has been dedicated to predicting their properties based on their atomic configurations. However, prevailing Crystal Structure Prediction methods focus on identifying the most stable solutions that lie at the global minimum of the energy function. This approach overlooks other potentially interesting materials that lie in neighbouring local minima and have different material properties such as conductivity or resistance to deformation. By contrast, Quality-Diversity algorithms provide a promising avenue for Crystal Structure Prediction as they aim to find a collection of high-performing solutions that have diverse characteristics. However, it may also be valuable to optimise for the stability of crystal structures alongside other objectives such as magnetism or thermoelectric efficiency. Therefore, in this work, we harness the power of Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity algorithms in order to find crystal structures which have diverse features and achieve different trade-offs of objectives. We analyse our approach on 5 crystal systems and demonstrate that it is not only able to re-discover known real-life structures, but also find promising new ones. Moreover, we propose a method for illuminating the objective space to gain an understanding of what trade-offs can be achieved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jincheng Dai, Zhuowei Huang, Haiyun Jiang, Chen Chen, Deng Cai, Wei Bi, Shuming Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, necessitate substantial GPU memory and consume significant computational resources. Beyond the memory taken up by model weights, the memory used by the KV cache rises linearly with sequence length, becoming a primary bottleneck for inference. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for optimizing the KV cache, which considerably minimizes its memory footprint. Upon thorough investigation, we discover that in most Transformer models, (i) there is a striking similarity between adjacent tokens' query vectors, and (ii) the attention calculation of the current query can rely exclusively on the attention information of a small fraction of preceding queries. Based on these observations, we present CORM, a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains essential key-value pairs for inference without the need for model fine-tuning. Our validation shows that CORM reduces the inference memory usage of KV cache by up to 70\% with negligible performance degradation across six tasks in LongBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CORM is compatible with GQA for further compression rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lotem Golany, Filippo Galgani, Maya Mamo, Nimrod Parasol, Omer Vandsburger, Nadav Bar, Ido Dagan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating data generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-based data generation in the challenging setting of source-grounded information-seeking dialogs, with response attribution, over long documents. Our source texts consist of long and noisy meeting transcripts, adding to the task complexity. Since automating attribution remains difficult, we propose a semi-automatic approach: dialog queries and responses are generated with LLMs, followed by human verification and identification of attribution spans. Using this approach, we created MISeD -- Meeting Information Seeking Dialogs dataset -- a dataset of information-seeking dialogs focused on meeting transcripts. Models finetuned with MISeD demonstrate superior performance compared to off-the-shelf models, even those of larger size. Finetuning on MISeD gives comparable response generation quality to finetuning on fully manual data, while improving attribution quality and reducing time and effort.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing size of language models necessitates a thorough analysis across multiple dimensions to assess trade-offs among crucial hardware metrics such as latency, energy consumption, GPU memory usage, and performance. Identifying optimal model configurations under specific hardware constraints is becoming essential but remains challenging due to the computational load of exhaustive training and evaluation on multiple devices. To address this, we introduce HW-GPT-Bench, a hardware-aware benchmark that utilizes surrogate predictions to approximate various hardware metrics across 13 devices of architectures in the GPT-2 family, with architectures containing up to 774M parameters. Our surrogates, via calibrated predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates, faithfully model the heteroscedastic noise inherent in the energy and latency measurements. To estimate perplexity, we employ weight-sharing techniques from Neural Architecture Search (NAS), inheriting pretrained weights from the largest GPT-2 model. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of HW-GPT-Bench by simulating optimization trajectories of various multi-objective optimization algorithms in just a few seconds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solar flares, especially C, M, and X class, pose significant risks to satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids. We present a novel approach for predicting extreme solar flares using HMI intensitygrams and magnetograms. By detecting sunspots from intensitygrams and extracting magnetic field patches from magnetograms, we train a Residual Network (ResNet) to classify extreme class flares. Our model demonstrates high accuracy, offering a robust tool for predicting extreme solar flares and improving space weather forecasting. Additionally, we show that HMI magnetograms provide more useful data for deep learning compared to other SDO AIA images by better capturing features critical for predicting flare magnitudes. This study underscores the importance of identifying magnetic fields in solar flare prediction, marking a significant advancement in solar activity prediction with practical implications for mitigating space weather impacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Huang, Xudong Guo, Mengdi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding reduces the inference latency of a target large language model via utilizing a smaller and faster draft model. Its performance depends on a hyperparameter K -- the candidate length, i.e., the number of candidate tokens for the target model to verify in each round. However, previous methods often use simple heuristics to choose K, which may result in sub-optimal performance. We study the choice of the candidate length K and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. We theoretically show that the optimal policy of this Markov decision process takes the form of a threshold policy, i.e., the current speculation should stop and be verified when the probability of getting a rejection exceeds a threshold value. Motivated by this theory, we propose SpecDec++, an enhanced version of speculative decoding that adaptively determines the candidate length on the fly. We augment the draft model with a trained acceptance prediction head to predict the conditional acceptance probability of the candidate tokens. SpecDec++ will stop the current speculation when the predicted probability that at least one token gets rejected exceeds a threshold. We implement SpecDec++ and apply it to the llama-2-chat 7B & 70B model pair. Our adaptive method achieves a 2.04x speedup on the Alpaca dataset (an additional 7.2% improvement over the baseline speculative decoding). On the GSM8K and HumanEval datasets, our method achieves a 2.26x speedup (9.4% improvement) and 2.23x speedup (11.1% improvement), respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiesong Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: A popular approach for solving zero-sum games is to maintain populations of policies to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Previous studies have shown that Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) algorithm is an effective multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for solving such games. However, repeatedly training new policies from scratch to approximate Best Response (BR) to opponents' mixed policies at each iteration is both inefficient and costly. While some PSRO variants initialize a new policy by inheriting from past BR policies, this approach limits the exploration of new policies, especially against challenging opponents. To address this issue, we propose Fusion-PSRO, which employs policy fusion to initialize policies for better approximation to BR. By selecting high-quality base policies from meta-NE, policy fusion fuses the base policies into a new policy through model averaging. This approach allows the initialized policies to incorporate multiple expert policies, making it easier to handle difficult opponents compared to inheriting from past BR policies or initializing from scratch. Moreover, our method only modifies the policy initialization phase, allowing its application to nearly all PSRO variants without additional training overhead. Our experiments on non-transitive matrix games, Leduc Poker, and the more complex Liars Dice demonstrate that Fusion-PSRO enhances the performance of nearly all PSRO variants, achieving lower exploitability.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01538">What Are Large Language Models Mapping to in the Brain? A Case Against Over-Reliance on Brain Scores</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebrahim Feghhi, Nima Hadidi, Bryan Song, Idan A. Blank, Jonathan C. Kao</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain. One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score". Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing. This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing. Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages. We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain. We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward. Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position. This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like. Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure. We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional manufacturing faces challenges adapting to dynamic environments and quickly responding to manufacturing changes. The use of multi-agent systems has improved adaptability and coordination but requires further advancements in rapid human instruction comprehension, operational adaptability, and coordination through natural language integration. Large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 enhance multi-agent manufacturing systems by enabling agents to communicate in natural language and interpret human instructions for decision-making. This research introduces a novel framework where large language models enhance the capabilities of agents in manufacturing, making them more adaptable, and capable of processing context-specific instructions. A case study demonstrates the practical application of this framework, showing how agents can effectively communicate, understand tasks, and execute manufacturing processes, including precise G-code allocation among agents. The findings highlight the importance of continuous large language model integration into multi-agent manufacturing systems and the development of sophisticated agent communication protocols for a more flexible manufacturing system.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have promoted a revolution in communication technology and offered various customer services. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been exploited to facilitate IoT operations and maximize their potential in modern application scenarios. In particular, the convergence of IoT and AI has led to a new networking paradigm called Intelligent IoT (IIoT), which has the potential to significantly transform businesses and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT by investigating its significant applications in mobile networks, as well as its associated security and privacy issues. Specifically, we explore and discuss the roles of IIoT in a wide range of key application domains, from smart healthcare and smart cities to smart transportation and smart industries. Through such extensive discussions, we investigate important security issues in IIoT networks, where network attacks, confidentiality, integrity, and intrusion are analyzed, along with a discussion of potential countermeasures. Privacy issues in IIoT networks were also surveyed and discussed, including data, location, and model privacy leakage. Finally, we outline several key challenges and highlight potential research directions in this important area.</p>

Traditional techniques, such as weight averaging and ensemble methods, often fail to fully harness the capabilities of pre-trained networks. Our approach leverages a genetic algorithm with tournament selection, crossover, and mutation to optimize weight combinations, creating a more effective fusion. This technique allows the merged model to inherit advantageous features from both parent models, resulting in enhanced accuracy and robustness. Through experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we demonstrate that our genetic algorithm-based weight merging method improves test accuracy compared to individual models and conventional methods. This approach provides a scalable solution for integrating multiple pre-trained networks across various deep learning applications.

To demonstrate the utility of SciRIFF, we develop a sample-efficient strategy to adapt a general instruction-following model for science by performing additional finetuning on a mix of general-domain and SciRIFF demonstrations. In evaluations on nine held-out scientific tasks, our model -- called SciTulu -- improves over a strong LLM baseline by 28.1% and 6.5% at the 7B and 70B scales respectively, while maintaining general instruction-following performance within 2% of the baseline. We are optimistic that SciRIFF will facilitate the development and evaluation of LLMs to help researchers navigate the ever-growing body of scientific literature. We release our dataset, model checkpoints, and data processing and evaluation code to enable further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomas Kulvicius, Dajie Zhang, Luise Poustka, Sven B\"olte, Lennart Jahn, Sarah Fl\"ugge, Marc Kraft, Markus Zweckstetter, Karin Nielsen-Saines, Florentin W\"org\"otter, Peter B Marschik</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a recent boom in the development of AI solutions to facilitate and enhance diagnostic procedures for established clinical tools. To assess the integrity of the developing nervous system, the Prechtl general movement assessment (GMA) is recognized for its clinical value in diagnosing neurological impairments in early infancy. GMA has been increasingly augmented through machine learning approaches intending to scale-up its application, circumvent costs in the training of human assessors and further standardize classification of spontaneous motor patterns. Available deep learning tools, all of which are based on single sensor modalities, are however still considerably inferior to that of well-trained human assessors. These approaches are hardly comparable as all models are designed, trained and evaluated on proprietary/silo-data sets. With this study we propose a sensor fusion approach for assessing fidgety movements (FMs) comparing three different sensor modalities (pressure, inertial, and visual sensors). Various combinations and two sensor fusion approaches (late and early fusion) for infant movement classification were tested to evaluate whether a multi-sensor system outperforms single modality assessments. The performance of the three-sensor fusion (classification accuracy of 94.5\%) was significantly higher than that of any single modality evaluated, suggesting the sensor fusion approach is a promising avenue for automated classification of infant motor patterns. The development of a robust sensor fusion system may significantly enhance AI-based early recognition of neurofunctions, ultimately facilitating automated early detection of neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10248">On the Worst Prompt Performance of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Cao, Deng Cai, Zhisong Zhang, Yuexian Zou, Wai Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is acutely sensitive to the phrasing of prompts, which raises significant concerns about their reliability in real-world scenarios. Existing studies often divide prompts into task-level instructions and case-level inputs and primarily focus on evaluating and improving robustness against variations in tasks-level instructions. However, this setup fails to fully address the diversity of real-world user queries and assumes the existence of task-specific datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce RobustAlpacaEval, a new benchmark that consists of semantically equivalent case-level queries and emphasizes the importance of using the worst prompt performance to gauge the lower bound of model performance. Extensive experiments on RobustAlpacaEval with ChatGPT and six open-source LLMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Gemma families uncover substantial variability in model performance; for instance, a difference of 45.48% between the worst and best performance for the Llama-2-70B-chat model, with its worst performance dipping as low as 9.38%. We further illustrate the difficulty in identifying the worst prompt from both model-agnostic and model-dependent perspectives, emphasizing the absence of a shortcut to characterize the worst prompt. We also attempt to enhance the worst prompt performance using existing prompt engineering and prompt consistency methods, but find that their impact is limited. These findings underscore the need to create more resilient LLMs that can maintain high performance across diverse prompts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel S. Sohn, Danrui Li, Sen Zhang, Che-Jui Chang, Mubbasir Kapadia</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital storytelling, essential in entertainment, education, and marketing, faces challenges in production scalability and flexibility. The StoryAgent framework, introduced in this paper, utilizes Large Language Models and generative tools to automate and refine digital storytelling. Employing a top-down story drafting and bottom-up asset generation approach, StoryAgent tackles key issues such as manual intervention, interactive scene orchestration, and narrative consistency. This framework enables efficient production of interactive and consistent narratives across multiple modalities, democratizing content creation and enhancing engagement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Wu, Arash A. Amini</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider an online decision-making problem with a reward function defined over graph-structured data. We formally formulate the problem as an instance of graph action bandit. We then propose \texttt{GNN-TS}, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) powered Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm which employs a GNN approximator for estimating the mean reward function and the graph neural tangent features for uncertainty estimation. We prove that, under certain boundness assumptions on the reward function, GNN-TS achieves a state-of-the-art regret bound which is (1) sub-linear of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\tilde{d} T)^{1/2})$ in the number of interaction rounds, $T$, and a notion of effective dimension $\tilde{d}$, and (2) independent of the number of graph nodes. Empirical results validate that our proposed \texttt{GNN-TS} exhibits competitive performance and scales well on graph action bandit problems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11481">Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Average Reward Objective: Model-Based and Model-Free Algorithms</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaneet Aggarwal, Washim Uddin Mondal, Qinbo Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) serves as a versatile framework for sequential decision-making, finding applications across diverse domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, recommendation systems, supply chain optimization, biology, mechanics, and finance. The primary objective in these applications is to maximize the average reward. Real-world scenarios often necessitate adherence to specific constraints during the learning process.
  This monograph focuses on the exploration of various model-based and model-free approaches for Constrained RL within the context of average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The investigation commences with an examination of model-based strategies, delving into two foundational methods - optimism in the face of uncertainty and posterior sampling. Subsequently, the discussion transitions to parametrized model-free approaches, where the primal-dual policy gradient-based algorithm is explored as a solution for constrained MDPs. The monograph provides regret guarantees and analyzes constraint violation for each of the discussed setups.
  For the above exploration, we assume the underlying MDP to be ergodic. Further, this monograph extends its discussion to encompass results tailored for weakly communicating MDPs, thereby broadening the scope of its findings and their relevance to a wider range of practical scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12718">AGLA: Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Assembly of Global and Local Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin An, Feng Tian, Sicong Leng, Jiahao Nie, Haonan Lin, QianYing Wang, Guang Dai, Ping Chen, Shijian Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their great success across various multimodal tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are facing a prevalent problem with object hallucinations, where the generated textual responses are inconsistent with ground-truth objects in the given image. This paper investigates various LVLMs and pinpoints attention deficiency toward discriminative local image features as one root cause of object hallucinations. Specifically, LVLMs predominantly attend to prompt-independent global image features, while failing to capture prompt-relevant local features, consequently undermining the visual grounding capacity of LVLMs and leading to hallucinations. To this end, we propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates object hallucinations by exploring an ensemble of global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Our approach exhibits an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is reserved while irrelevant distractions are masked. With the augmented view, a calibrated decoding distribution can be derived by integrating generative global features from the original image and discriminative local features from the augmented image. Extensive experiments show that AGLA consistently mitigates object hallucinations and enhances general perception capability for LVLMs across various discriminative and generative benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Lackel/AGLA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siemen Brussee, Giorgio Buzzanca, Anne M. R. Schrader, Jesper Kers</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathological analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has seen a surge in the utilization of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and explore emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Suglia, Claudio Greco, Katie Baker, Jose L. Part, Ioannis Papaioannou, Arash Eshghi, Ioannis Konstas, Oliver Lemon</p>
<p>Abstract: AI personal assistants deployed via robots or wearables require embodied understanding to collaborate with humans effectively. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) primarily focus on third-person view videos, neglecting the richness of egocentric perceptual experience. To address this gap, we propose three key contributions. First, we introduce the Egocentric Video Understanding Dataset (EVUD) for training VLMs on video captioning and question answering tasks specific to egocentric videos. Second, we present AlanaVLM, a 7B parameter VLM trained using parameter-efficient methods on EVUD. Finally, we evaluate AlanaVLM's capabilities on OpenEQA, a challenging benchmark for embodied video question answering. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming open-source models including strong Socratic models using GPT-4 as a planner by 3.6%. Additionally, we outperform Claude 3 and Gemini Pro Vision 1.0 and showcase competitive results compared to Gemini Pro 1.5 and GPT-4V, even surpassing the latter in spatial reasoning. This research paves the way for building efficient VLMs that can be deployed in robots or wearables, leveraging embodied video understanding to collaborate seamlessly with humans in everyday tasks, contributing to the next generation of Embodied AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mandar Sharma, Nikhil Muralidhar, Shengzhe Xu, Raquib Bin Yousuf, Naren Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: The pretraining-fine-tuning paradigm has been the de facto strategy for transfer learning in modern language modeling. With the understanding that task adaptation in LMs is often a function of parameters shared across tasks, we argue that a more surgical approach to regularization needs to exist for smoother transfer learning. Towards this end, we investigate how the pretraining loss landscape is affected by these task-sensitive parameters through an information-theoretic lens. We then leverage the findings from our investigations to devise a novel approach to dropout for improved model regularization and better downstream generalization. This approach, named guided dropout, is both task & architecture agnostic and adds no computational overhead to the fine-tuning process. Through empirical evaluations, we showcase that our approach to regularization yields consistently better performance, even in scenarios of data paucity, compared to standardized baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooneh Mousavi, Luca Della Libera, Jarod Duret, Artem Ploujnikov, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete audio tokens have recently gained considerable attention for their potential to connect audio and language processing, enabling the creation of modern multimodal large language models. Ideal audio tokens must effectively preserve phonetic and semantic content along with paralinguistic information, speaker identity, and other details. While several types of audio tokens have been recently proposed, identifying the optimal tokenizer for various tasks is challenging due to the inconsistent evaluation settings in existing studies. To address this gap, we release the Discrete Audio and Speech Benchmark (DASB), a comprehensive leaderboard for benchmarking discrete audio tokens across a wide range of discriminative tasks, including speech recognition, speaker identification and verification, emotion recognition, keyword spotting, and intent classification, as well as generative tasks such as speech enhancement, separation, and text-to-speech. Our results show that, on average, semantic tokens outperform compression tokens across most discriminative and generative tasks. However, the performance gap between semantic tokens and standard continuous representations remains substantial, highlighting the need for further research in this field.</p>
