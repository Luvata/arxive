<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Fan, Roger Ren, Jingyuan Li, Rahul Pandey, Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar, Ivan Bulyko, Ankur Gandhe, Ge Liu, Yile Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning, domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20868">Crisis-Resilient Portfolio Management via Graph-based Spatio-Temporal Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zan Li, Rui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms, filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707% improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31% market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing assumptions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20872">MOBO-OSD: Batch Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization via Orthogonal Search Directions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lam Ngo, Huong Ha, Jeffrey Chan, Hongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs, MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally, MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihir Panchal, Ying-Jung Chen, Surya Parkash</p>
<p>Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution, which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across vulnerable mountainous terrains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20877">Multimodal Negative Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Baoquan Gong, Xiyuan Gao, Pengfei Zhu, Qinghua Hu, Bing Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm: "Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities' target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities, particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach against competing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danying Ge, Jianhua Gao, Yixue Yang, Weixing Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Wang, Chang-Han Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rattana Pukdee, Ziqi Ke, Chirag Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets, traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srivathsan Badrinarayanan, Yue Su, Janghoon Ock, Alan Pham, Sanya Ahuja, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning. In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungjun Cho, Changho Shin, Suenggwan Jo, Xinya Yan, Shourjo Aditya Chaudhuri, Frederic Sala</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20955">Safety Assessment in Reinforcement Learning via Model Predictive Control</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeff Pflueger, Michael Everett</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance. Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics, not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizhe Rao, Runqiu Zhang, Sajal Saha, Liang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training. Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its adaptive feedback mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqiang Chen, Gang Niu, James Cheng, Bo Han, Masashi Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate (MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection. However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements over single-agent methods in error detection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20970">On the accuracy of implicit neural representations for cardiovascular anatomies and hemodynamic fields</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jubilee Lee, Daniele E. Schiavazzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation, synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10 cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is available at https://github.com/desResLab/nrf.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyu Cui, Fang Wu, Haokai Zhao, Minggao Feng, Xenophon Evangelopoulos, Andrew I. Cooper, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage. Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly. L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery.</p>

Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning. MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu, Jiamang Wang, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Zhizhao Wen, Ruoxin Zhang, Puyang Xu, Yifan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.</p>

We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions, and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees.

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Ghawaly, Andrew Nicholson, Catherine Schuman, Dalton Diez, Aaron Young, Brett Witherspoon</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49 neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%) baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enshu Liu, Qian Chen, Xuefei Ning, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Zinan Lin, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required. Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256. Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$ training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and high-quality AR modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhong Luo, Austin Hoag, Xintong Wang, Philip S. Thomas, Przemyslaw A. Grabowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with *controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air **R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)* framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21019">More Than Memory Savings: Zeroth-Order Optimization Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanhao Yu, Zheng Wang, Shuteng Niu, Sen Lin, Li Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning (CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge, particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21020">From Information to Generative Exponent: Learning Rate Induces Phase Transitions in SGD</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Christopher Tsiolis, Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini, Murat A. Erdogdu</p>
<p>Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule -- and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent. However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s) and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime" with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent. Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation} (iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsong Xu, Jonathan L Bamber, Nils Thuerey, Niklas Boers, Paul Bates, Gustau Camps-Valls, Yilei Shi, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate, physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple, foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling - performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically modulate detectability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel M. Steinberg, Asiri Wijesinghe, Rafael Oliveira, Piotr Koniusz, Cheng Soon Ong, Edwin V. Bonilla</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation.</p>

Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature. First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution. Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism -- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in practical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning (RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains, however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG), natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity, while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset (2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters, including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms; our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space weather forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raul Cavalcante Dinardi, Bruno Yamamoto, Anna Helena Reali Costa, Artur Jordao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities, particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well defined.</p>

<p>Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuojin Li, Marco Paolieri, Leana Golubchik</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand, their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times. Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and 1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes: encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL, a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation. It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and 4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated learning is practical for real-world deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyang Xu, Hongyang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph, yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunuo Zhang, Baiting Luo, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Gabor Karsai, Abhishek Dubey</p>
<p>Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maitreyi Swaroop, Tamar Krishnamurti, Bryan Wilder</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors, and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes. By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linyuan Geng, Linxiao Yang, Xinyue Gu, Liang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of power grids.

<p>Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex, large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghong Chen, Dongkyu Eugene Kim, Mike Domaratzki, Pingzhao Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions, facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for advancing automated molecular design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angshul Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers, we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local minimum.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadi Aljawarneh, Juan A. Lara, Muneer Bani Yassein</p>
<p>Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables (temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance, obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep working on this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Galanti, Aarya Bookseller, Korok Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities, stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) -- to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic study of models that have remained analytically intractable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Zhao, Aidan Li, Rob Brekelmans, Roger Grosse</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches and alternatives.</p>

PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference, reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Demetrio, Giovanni Apruzzese, Kathrin Grosse, Pavel Laskov, Emil Lupu, Vera Rimmer, Philine Widmer</p>
<p>Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process. Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025 editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can); if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection (holds true only for accepted papers).

<p><b>Authors:</b> JunRu Luo, Difei Cheng, Bo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However, minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize, as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss, and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data. Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online AUC performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models (TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples. This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap. We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with better sample efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability. Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning, alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence on diverse graphs and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Pivi, Simone Gazza, Davide Evangelista, Roberto Amadini, Maurizio Gabbrielli</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates, however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes.</p>

Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waris Radji (Scool, CRIStAL), Odalric-Ambrym Maillard (Scool, CRIStAL)</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Martinuzzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade, aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and experimentation. All packages are available under the MIT license and actively maintained on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Bonfanti, Ismael Medina, Roman List, Bj\"orn Staeves, Roberto Santana, Marco Ellero</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junshu Sun, Wanxing Chang, Chenxue Yang, Qingming Huang, Shuhui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeongyu Kim, Geonhui Han, Dosik Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/hyeongyu-kim/Buffer_TTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavankumar Chandankar, Robin Burchard</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyang Zhang, Chen Liang, Haoxuan Qiu, Hongzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training, particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21292">Additive Models Explained: A Computational Complexity Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahaf Bassan, Michal Moshkovitz, Guy Katz</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable* within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations are possible or provably hard.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21296">An Evidence-Based Post-Hoc Adjustment Framework for Anomaly Detection Under Data Contamination</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukanya Patra, Souhaib Ben Taieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies, leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD across diverse AD models and evidence pairs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Fuchs, Nadja Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Ganesh, Hsiang Hsu, Golnoosh Farnadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance -- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Sarkar, Nishant Pandey, Sayak Ray Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret, which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards, aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the $p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all $p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Tang, Jichu Li, Difan Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g., moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions, explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Boutet, Lucas Magnana</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation. In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF, a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF) architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module, enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic 2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myeongho Jeon, Jan Sobotka, Suhwan Choi, Maria Brbi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts, often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30% on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to automatically identify trustworthy supervision.</p>

Among the most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional trainable weight matrix.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning, designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as fine-tuning LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies. Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues, especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.</p>

While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen (https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junda Wang, Minghui Hu, Ning Li, Abdulaziz Al-Ali, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan</p>
<p>Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization, has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R) in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention. edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning. Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Kraft, Andreas Theissler, Vera Wienhausen-Wilke, Gjergji Kasneci, Hendrik Lensch</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy. Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring, (ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Whie Jung, Dong Hoon Lee, Seunghoon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camila Kolling, Vy Ai Vo, Mariya Toneva</p>
<p>Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanxiong Luo, Shoujin Huang, Yanlong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions -- corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast, self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21426">A Rapid Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Inverse Stefan Problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei-Zhi Zhuang, Ming-Yue Yang, Fei Ren, Hong-Ya Yue, He Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94% training time, compared to conventional PINNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Liang, Shuqing Shi, Yudi Zhang, Biwei Huang, Yali Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids, challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts. To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations (ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuojing Tian, Yushu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states, and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT) and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in future large decision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Danieli, Pau Rodriguez, Miguel Sarabia, Xavier Suau, Luca Zappella</p>
<p>Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling, but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures. To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear RNN models at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge D\'iez, Pablo P\'erez-N\'u\~nez, Oscar Luaces, Beatriz Remeseiro, Antonio Bahamonde</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS), is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item. In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six cities of different sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daan Caljon, Jente Van Belle, Wouter Verbeke</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training. This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a dataset.

<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting. Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Devale, Pramith Devulapalli, Steve Hanneke</p>
<p>Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$ Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$ learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable, solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction, high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian structure learning task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huatian Gong, Jiuh-Biing Sheu, Zheng Wang, Xiaoguang Yang, Ran Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response, enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA, routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm, requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10 seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Wehner, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2) retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit - simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy. Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is feasible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mojtaba Nafez, Mobina Poulaei, Nikan Vasei, Bardia Soltani Moakhar, Mohammad Sabokrou, MohammadHossein Rohban</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation, pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy, significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance across multiple benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions, before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihong Qin, Aimin Wang, Geng Sun, Zemin Sun, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Dong In Kim, Zhu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles, modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices (UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning, computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game (MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence stability and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialu Tang, Hung Manh Pham, Ignace De Lathauwer, Henk S. Schipper, Yuan Lu, Dong Ma, Aaqib Saeed</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Wu, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv (HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction. Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a 3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting performance on complex, real-world graph data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21582">An unsupervised tour through the hidden pathways of deep neural networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Doimo</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data. Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the training error is zero.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yassine El Ouahidi, Jonathan Lys, Philipp Th\"olke, Nicolas Farrugia, Bastien Pasdeloup, Vincent Gripon, Karim Jerbi, Giulia Lioi</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision, their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets, which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks, including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21592">Accelerating Data Generation for Nonlinear temporal PDEs via homologous perturbation in solution space</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Liu, Zhenxin Huang, Hong Wang, huanshuo dong, Haiyang Xin, Hongwei Zhao, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However, these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training. Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar) with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21599">SHAP Meets Tensor Networks: Provably Tractable Explanations with Parallelism</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Reda Marzouk, Shahaf Bassan, Guy Katz</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic* time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs, this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models. Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become *efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Davis, Michael S. Albergo, Nicholas M. Boffi, Michael M. Bronstein, Avishek Joey Bose</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data. Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods: Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows, to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jens E. d'Hondt, Wieger R. Punter, Odysseas Papapetrou</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and simulation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21631">Few-Shot Knowledge Distillation of LLMs With Counterfactual Explanations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Faisal Hamman, Pasan Dissanayake, Yanjun Fu, Sanghamitra Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably, CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics, suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilien Dreveton, Elaine Siyu Liu, Matthias Grossglauser, Patrick Thiran</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Berman, Jacob Ginesin, Marco Pacini, Robin Walters</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique, to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic interpretability.

<p>Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases. We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations. The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other visual media.</p>

<p>Abstract: AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dixon Vimalajeewa, Ursula U. Muller, Brani Vidakovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrnaz Asadi, Sina Javadzadeh, Rahil Soroushmojdehi, S. Alireza Seyyed Mousavi, Terence D. Sanger</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines. Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for each within-trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase-specific graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions during behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Tang, Jon Donnelly, Alina Jade Barnett, Lesia Semenova, Jin Jing, Peter Hadar, Ioannis Karakis, Olga Selioutski, Kehan Zhao, M. Brandon Westover, Cynthia Rudin</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro H. Artiles, Hiromu Yakura, Levin Brinkmann, Mar Canet Sola, Hassan Abu Alhaija, Ignacio Serna, Nasim Rahaman, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Iyad Rahwan</p>
<p>Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models (LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation (N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishaal Udandarao, Zhiyun Lu, Xuankai Chang, Yongqiang Wang, Violet Z. Yao, Albin Madapally Jose, Fartash Faghri, Josh Gardner, Chung-Cheng Chiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spoken Question-Answering (SQA) is a core capability for useful and interactive artificial intelligence systems. Recently, several speech-language models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a 3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marta Gentiloni Silveri, Giovanni Conforti, Alain Durmus</p>
<p>Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical guarantees for DSBM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ant\^onio H. Ribeiro, David V\"avinggren, Dave Zachariah, Thomas B. Sch\"on, Francis Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranamya Kulkarni, Puranjay Datta, Burak Var{\i}c{\i}, Emre Acart\"urk, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Ali Tajer</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically, this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background, and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated (intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical testbed for CRL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yirong Shen, Lu Gan, Cong Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models that maximize model likelihood have gained traction in many practical settings. Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many strong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter likelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model, showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood (NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation, and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asif Islam, Farhan Ishtiaque, Md. Muhyminul Haque, Kaled Masukur Rahman, Ravi Vaidyanathan, Khondaker A. Mamun</p>
<p>Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a 10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task, requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware. We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying. To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890 suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT, and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy. Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in surgery. These contributions support reproducible evaluation and development of precision-focused, long-horizon dexterous manipulation policies necessary for end-to-end suturing.

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks, providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models and previous adaptation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen, Alsharif Abuadbba, Kristen Moore, Tingming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image, without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and (RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.</p>

By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) systems into critical industries such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity has transformed decision-making processes, but it also brings new challenges around trust, security, and accountability. As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring the transparency and correctness of AI-driven decisions is crucial, especially when they have direct consequences on privacy, security, or fairness. Verifiable AI, powered by Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), offers a robust solution to these challenges. zkML enables the verification of AI model inferences without exposing sensitive data, providing an essential layer of trust and privacy. However, traditional zkML systems typically require deep cryptographic expertise, placing them beyond the reach of most ML engineers. In this paper, we introduce JSTprove, a specialized zkML toolkit, built on Polyhedra Network's Expander backend, to enable AI developers and ML engineers to generate and verify proofs of AI inference. JSTprove provides an end-to-end verifiable AI inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a simple command-line interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility. We present the design, innovations, and real-world use cases of JSTprove as well as our blueprints and tooling to encourage community review and extension. JSTprove therefore serves both as a usable zkML product for current engineering needs and as a reproducible foundation for future research and production deployments of verifiable AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study (25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall: Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains \textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms, handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g., ``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle, site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-dimensional data that exhibit an intrinsic low-dimensional structure are ubiquitous in machine learning and data science. While various approaches allow for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings. These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors, comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabo Shi, Dimitrios Pezaros, Yehia Elkhatib</p>
<p>Abstract: The global scarcity of GPUs necessitates more sophisticated strategies for Deep Learning jobs in shared cluster environments. Accurate estimation of how much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics. Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances, without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs, which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately, these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential over current solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atoosa Chegini, Hamid Kazemi, Garrett Souza, Maria Safi, Yang Song, Samy Bengio, Sinead Williamson, Mehrdad Farajtabar</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs), consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Philipp Walter, Chawin Sitawarin, Jamie Hayes, David Stutz, Ilia Shumailov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingru Zhang, Liang Qiu, Ilgee Hong, Zhenghao Xu, Tianyi Liu, Shiyang Li, Rongzhi Zhang, Zheng Li, Lihong Li, Bing Yin, Chao Zhang, Jianshu Chen, Haoming Jiang, Tuo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT, being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data, particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungseon Lee, Kunwoong Kim, Jihu Lee, Dongyoon Yang, Yongdai Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is large so that many subgroups are very small.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kshipra Bhawalkar, Yang Cai, Zhe Feng, Christopher Liaw, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone (resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone) submodular maximization under noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangxin Su, Hanchen Wang, Jianwei Wang, Wenjie Zhang, Ying Zhang, Jian Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation. However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and graph learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haarika Manda, Manshi Sagar,  Yogesh, Kartikay Singh, Cindy Zhao, Tarun Mangla, Phillipa Gill, Elizabeth Belding, Arpit Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Internet speed tests are indispensable for users, ISPs, and policymakers, but their static flooding-based design imposes growing costs: a single high-speed test can transfer hundreds of megabytes, and collectively, platforms like Ookla, M-Lab, and Fast.com generate petabytes of traffic each month. Reducing this burden requires deciding when a test can be stopped early without sacrificing accuracy. We frame this as an optimal stopping problem and show that existing heuristics-static thresholds, BBR pipe-full signals, or throughput stability rules from Fast.com and FastBTS-capture only a narrow portion of the achievable accuracy-savings trade-off. This paper introduces TURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop existing platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1) from test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final throughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to decide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop. Leveraging richer transport-level features (RTT, retransmissions, congestion window) alongside throughput, TURBOTEST exposes a single tunable parameter for accuracy tolerance and includes a fallback mechanism for high-variability cases. Evaluation on 173,000 M-Lab NDT speed tests (2024-2025) shows that TURBOTEST achieves nearly 2-4x higher data savings than an approach based on BBR signals while reducing median error. These results demonstrate that adaptive ML-based termination can deliver accurate, efficient, and deployable speed tests at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dandan Liang, Jianing Zhang, Evan Chen, Zhe Li, Rui Li, Haibo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables scalable training on edge devices by combining the parallelism of Federated Learning (FL) with the computational offloading of Split Learning (SL). Despite its great success, SFL suffers significantly from the well-known straggler issue in distributed learning systems. This problem is exacerbated by the dependency between Split Server and clients: the Split Server side model update relies on receiving activations from clients. Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced update mechanism.
  By enabling the server to perform $\tau$ local updates per client round, MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{d/(\tau T)})$ for non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\tau$ in communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate that MU-SplitFed consistently outperforms baseline methods with the presence of stragglers and effectively mitigates their impact through adaptive tuning of $\tau$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Flora C. Shi, Martin J. Wainwright, Stephen Bates</p>
<p>Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naomi Desobry, Elnura Zhalieva, Souhaib Ben Taieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied, defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions, which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work, we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor. Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without sacrificing predictive accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output. When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of 0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Won Park, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Li, Liao Yu, Qiang Yu, Yunliang Zang</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI) and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low- and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings. When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal learning in complex contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shufan Shen, Junshu Sun, Qingming Huang, Shuhui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second, we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.

<p>Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Zhang, Hanwei Zhu, Yan Zhong, Jiamang Wang, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

<p>Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Pluska, Sagar Malhotra</p>
<p>Abstract: Local convergence has emerged as a fundamental tool for analyzing sparse random graph models. We introduce a new notion of local convergence, color convergence, based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Color convergence fully characterizes the class of random graphs that are well-behaved in the limit for message-passing graph neural networks. Building on this, we propose the Refined Configuration Model (RCM), a random graph model that generalizes the configuration model. The RCM is universal with respect to local convergence among locally tree-like random graph models, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, stochastic block and configuration models. Finally, this framework enables a complete characterization of the random trees that arise as local limits of such graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abderrazek Abid, Thanh-Cong Ho, Fakhri Karray</p>
<p>Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition (HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and, in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung-hun Kim, Milan Vojnovi\'c, Min-hwan Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards. Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in time, with strong theoretical guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Corecco, Batuhan Yardim, Vinzenz Thoma, Zebang Shen, Niao He</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful, scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Cong Ho, Farah Kharrat, Abderrazek Abid, Fakhri Karray</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Pan, Zhiguang Cao, Chengyang Gu, Liu Liu, Peilin Zhao, Yize Chen, Fangzhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs) typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously. However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants, each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers, each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers. Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant. Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation, we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES over prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adetayo Adebimpe, Helmut Neukirchen, Thomas Welsh</p>
<p>Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) benchmarks inform LLM use decisions (e.g., "is this LLM safe to deploy for my use case and context?"). However, benchmarks may be rendered unreliable by various failure modes that impact benchmark bias, variance, coverage, or people's capacity to understand benchmark evidence. Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or severity, providing a frame for evaluating "benchmark risk," which is scored to provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility, consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking. The BenchRisk workflow allows for comparison between benchmarks; as an open-source tool, it also facilitates the identification and sharing of risks and their mitigations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emre Sahinoglu, Youbang Sun, Shahin Shahrampour</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the finite-time analysis of nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic optimization under Riemannian manifold constraints. We adapt the notion of Goldstein stationarity to the Riemannian setting as a performance metric for nonsmooth optimization on manifolds. We then propose a Riemannian Online to NonConvex (RO2NC) algorithm, for which we establish the sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ in finding $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. This result is the first-ever finite-time guarantee for fully nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization on manifolds and matches the optimal complexity in the Euclidean setting. When gradient information is unavailable, we develop a zeroth order version of RO2NC algorithm (ZO-RO2NC), for which we establish the same sample complexity. The numerical results support the theory and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando Vallecillos Ruiz, Max Hort, Leon Moonen</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However, the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be 83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by leveraging multiple LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Basile, Valentino Maiorca, Diego Doimo, Francesco Locatello, Alberto Cazzaniga</p>
<p>Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes. Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation, as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning. Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johann Flemming Gloy, Simon Olsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce $\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$ speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques, as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion. We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data. We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable embodied intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farhad Pashakhanloo</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that, even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift. Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying computation in the brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diana Cai, Robert M. Gower, David M. Blei, Lawrence K. Saul</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case, $t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density. Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elle Miller, Trevor McInroe, David Abel, Oisin Mac Aodha, Sethu Vijayakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential, the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity, particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation). Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation. Project page: https://elle-miller.github.io/tactile_rl</p>

<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nir Goren, Shai Yehezkel, Omer Dahary, Andrey Voynov, Or Patashnik, Daniel Cohen-Or</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one. The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving. Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905">VENI, VINDy, VICI: a generative reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paolo Conti, Jonas Kneifl, Andrea Manzoni, Attilio Frangi, J\"org Fehr, Steven L. Brunton, J. Nathan Kutz</p>
<p>Abstract: The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions.
  In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy).
  In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luoxiao Yang, Yun Wang, Xinqi Fan, Israel Cohen, Jingdong Chen, Zijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) possesses great practical values in various fields, including power and energy, transportation, etc. TSF methods have been studied based on knowledge from classical statistics to modern deep learning. Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have long been known to be problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. Practitioners expect a TSF foundation model that serves TSF tasks in different applications. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers one pioneering study in the TSF foundation model development method and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. ViTime fundamentally shifts TSF from numerical fitting to operations based on a binary image-based time series metric space and naturally supports both point and probabilistic forecasting. We also provide rigorous theoretical analyses of ViTime, including quantization-induced system error bounds and principled strategies for optimal parameter selection. Furthermore, we propose RealTS, an innovative synthesis algorithm generating diverse and realistic training samples, effectively enriching the training data and significantly enhancing model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's state-of-the-art performance. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15\%. With just 10\% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both leading foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks, a gap that widens with 100\% fine-tuning. ViTime also exhibits exceptional robustness, effectively handling missing data and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30\% under various data perturbations, validating the power of its visual space data operation paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Vashishtha, Abhinav Kumar, Atharva Pandey, Abbavaram Gowtham Reddy, Kabir Ahuja, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Amit Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: For text-based AI systems to interact in the real world, causal reasoning is an essential skill. Since active interventions are costly, we study to what extent a system can learn causal reasoning from symbolic demonstrations of causal axioms. Specifically, we present an axiomatic training method where the system learns from multiple demonstrations of a causal axiom (or rule), rather than incorporating the axiom as an inductive bias or inferring it from data values. A key question is whether the system would learn to generalize from the axiom demonstrations to more complex scenarios. Our results, based on applying axiomatic training to learn the transitivity axiom and d-separation rule, indicate that such generalization is possible. To avoid data contamination issues, we start with a 67 million parameter transformer model and train it from scratch. On both tasks, we find that a model trained on linear causal chains (along with some noisy variations) can generalize well to complex graphs, including longer causal chains, causal chains with reversed order, and graphs with branching.To handle diverse text inputs, the same method is extended to finetune language models. Finetuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct model on our axiomatic data leads to significant gains on causal benchmarks such as Corr2Cause and CLEAR, in some cases providing state-of-the-art performance surpassing GPT-4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Garc\'ia-Castellanos, Giovanni Luca Marchetti, Danica Kragic, Martina Scolamiero</p>
<p>Abstract: Relative representations are an established approach to zero-shot model stitching, consisting of a non-trainable transformation of the latent space of a deep neural network. Based on insights of topological and geometric nature, we propose two improvements to relative representations. First, we introduce a normalization procedure in the relative transformation, resulting in invariance to non-isotropic rescalings and permutations. The latter coincides with the symmetries in parameter space induced by common activation functions. Second, we propose to deploy topological densification when fine-tuning relative representations, a topological regularization loss encouraging clustering within classes. We provide an empirical investigation on a natural language task, where both the proposed variations yield improved performance on zero-shot model stitching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcos Negre Saura, Richard Allmendinger, Wei Pan, Theodore Papamarkou</p>
<p>Abstract: Ring attractors, mathematical models inspired by neural circuit dynamics, provide a biologically plausible mechanism to improve learning speed and accuracy in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Serving as specialized brain-inspired structures that encode spatial information and uncertainty, ring attractors explicitly encode the action space, facilitate the organization of neural activity, and enable the distribution of spatial representations across the neural network in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These structures also provide temporal filtering that stabilizes action selection during exploration, for example, by preserving the continuity between rotation angles in robotic control or adjacency between tactical moves in game-like environments. The application of ring attractors in the action selection process involves mapping actions to specific locations on the ring and decoding the selected action based on neural activity. We investigate the application of ring attractors by both building an exogenous model and integrating them as part of DRL agents. Our approach significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 100k benchmark, achieving a 53% increase in performance over selected baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anas Barakat, Souradip Chakraborty, Peihong Yu, Pratap Tokekar, Amrit Singh Bedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with general utilities (RLGU) offers a unifying framework to capture several problems beyond standard expected returns, including imitation learning, pure exploration, and safe RL. Despite recent fundamental advances in the theoretical analysis of policy gradient (PG) methods for standard RL and recent efforts in RLGU, the understanding of these PG algorithms and their scope of application in RLGU still remain limited. In this work, we establish global optimality guarantees of PG methods for RLGU in which the objective is a general concave utility function of the state-action occupancy measure. In the tabular setting, we provide global optimality results using a new proof technique building on recent theoretical developments on the convergence of PG methods for standard RL using gradient domination. Our proof technique opens avenues for analyzing policy parameterizations beyond the direct policy parameterization for RLGU. In addition, we provide global optimality results for large state-action space settings beyond prior work which has mostly focused on the tabular setting. In this large scale setting, we adapt PG methods by approximating occupancy measures within a function approximation class using maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample complexity only scales with the dimension induced by our approximation class instead of the size of the state-action space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuelin Xu, Xiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in adversarially robust learning, the underlying mechanisms that govern robust generalization remain poorly understood. We propose a novel PAC-Bayesian framework that explicitly links adversarial robustness to the posterior covariance of model parameters and the curvature of the adversarial loss landscape. By characterizing discrete-time SGD dynamics near a local optimum under quadratic loss, we derive closed-form posterior covariances for both the stationary regime and the early phase of non-stationary transition. Our analyses reveal how key factors, such as learning rate, gradient noise, and Hessian structure, jointly shape robust generalization during training. Through empirical visualizations of these theoretical quantities, we fundamentally explain the phenomenon of robust overfitting and shed light on why flatness-promoting techniques like adversarial weight perturbation help to improve robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Morris Yau, Ekin Aky\"urek, Jiayuan Mao, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Stefanie Jegelka, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous research has explored the computational expressivity of Transformer models in simulating Boolean circuits or Turing machines. However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present efforts in the fields of machine learning and time series forecasting to accurately predict counts of future suspected opioid overdoses recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the state of Kentucky. Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Ortiz-Perez, Manuel Benavent-Lledo, Jose Garcia-Rodriguez, David Tom\'as, M. Flores Vizcaya-Moreno</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging. However, under some circumstances, this decline is more pronounced than expected, typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Early detection of an anomalous decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timely professional intervention. While medical data can help, it often involves invasive procedures. An alternative approach is to employ non-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do not disturb daily activities. This survey reviews the most relevant non-intrusive methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline detection task, including audio, text, and visual processing. We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models. In addition, we present studies that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models. We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. From this review, several conclusions emerge. In most cases, text-based approaches consistently outperform other modalities. Furthermore, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite its widespread adoption, Adam's advantage over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) lacks a comprehensive theoretical explanation. This paper investigates Adam's sensitivity to rotations of the parameter space. We observe that Adam's performance in training transformers degrades under random rotations of the parameter space, indicating a crucial sensitivity to the choice of basis in practice. This reveals that conventional rotation-invariant assumptions are insufficient to capture Adam's advantages theoretically. To better understand the rotation-dependent properties that benefit Adam, we also identify structured rotations that preserve or even enhance its empirical performance. We then examine the rotation-dependent assumptions in the literature and find that they fall short in explaining Adam's behaviour across various rotation types. In contrast, we verify the orthogonality of the update as a promising indicator of Adam's basis sensitivity, suggesting it may be the key quantity for developing rotation-dependent theoretical frameworks that better explain its empirical success.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vighnesh Subramaniam, David Mayo, Colin Conwell, Tomaso Poggio, Boris Katz, Brian Cheung, Andrei Barbu</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate that architectures which traditionally are considered to be ill-suited for a task can be trained using inductive biases from another architecture. We call a network untrainable when it overfits, underfits, or converges to poor results even when tuning their hyperparameters. For example, fully connected networks overfit on object recognition while deep convolutional networks without residual connections underfit. The traditional answer is to change the architecture to impose some inductive bias, although the nature of that bias is unknown. We introduce guidance, where a guide network steers a target network using a neural distance function. The target minimizes its task loss plus a layerwise representational similarity against the frozen guide. If the guide is trained, this transfers over the architectural prior and knowledge of the guide to the target. If the guide is untrained, this transfers over only part of the architectural prior of the guide. We show that guidance prevents FCN overfitting on ImageNet, narrows the vanilla RNN-Transformer gap, boosts plain CNNs toward ResNet accuracy, and aids Transformers on RNN-favored tasks. We further identify that guidance-driven initialization alone can mitigate FCN overfitting. Our method provides a mathematical tool to investigate priors and architectures, and in the long term, could automate architecture design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinqing Zheng, Mikael Henaff, Amy Zhang, Aditya Grover, Brandon Amos</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment, while removing the need for large offline datasets required by prior work.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myunsoo Kim, Donghyeon Ki, Seong-Woong Shim, Byung-Jun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lee Cohen, Yishay Mansour, Shay Moran, Han Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision and Recall are fundamental metrics in machine learning tasks where both accurate predictions and comprehensive coverage are essential, such as in multi-label learning, language generation, medical studies, and recommender systems. A key challenge in these settings is the prevalence of one-sided feedback, where only positive examples are observed during training--e.g., in multi-label tasks like tagging people in Facebook photos, we may observe only a few tagged individuals, without knowing who else appears in the image. To address learning under such partial feedback, we introduce a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework in which hypotheses are set functions that map each input to a set of labels, extending beyond single-label predictions and generalizing classical binary, multi-class, and multi-label models. Our results reveal sharp statistical and algorithmic separations from standard settings: classical methods such as Empirical Risk Minimization provably fail, even for simple hypothesis classes. We develop new algorithms that learn from positive data alone, achieving optimal sample complexity in the realizable case, and establishing multiplicative--rather than additive-approximation guarantees in the agnostic case, where achieving additive regret is impossible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile Anand, Ishani Karmarkar, Guannan Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.</p>

We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baselines (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Gu, Zhuonan Zheng, Sheng Zhou, Meihan Liu, Jiawei Chen, Tanyu Qiao, Liangcheng Li, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success but are often considered to be challenged by varying levels of homophily in graphs. Recent \textit{empirical} studies have surprisingly shown that homophilic GNNs can perform well across datasets of different homophily levels with proper hyperparameter tuning, but the underlying theory and effective architectures remain unclear. To advance GNN universality across varying homophily, we theoretically revisit GNN message passing and uncover a novel \textit{smoothness-generalization dilemma}, where increasing hops inevitably enhances smoothness at the cost of generalization. This dilemma hinders learning in high-order homophilic neighborhoods and all heterophilic ones, where generalization is critical due to complex neighborhood class distributions that are sensitive to shifts induced by noise or sparsity. To address this, we introduce the Inceptive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) built on three simple yet effective design principles, which alleviate the dilemma by enabling distinct hop-wise generalization alongside improved overall generalization with adaptive smoothness. Benchmarking against 30 baselines demonstrates IGNN's superiority and reveals notable universality in certain homophilic GNN variants.

<p>Abstract: Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaiyan Xu, Sushil Vemuri, Kishan Panaganti, Dileep Kalathil, Rahul Jain, Deepak Ramachandran</p>
<p>Abstract: A major challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is the issue of distribution shift. LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using benchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangcheng Zhang, Yige Hong, Weina Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our main technical innovation is the construction of projection-based Lyapunov functions that certify the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region, even under full heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Abstract: In many scientific experiments, the data annotating cost constraints the pace for testing novel hypotheses. Yet, modern machine learning pipelines offer a promising solution, provided their predictions yield correct conclusions. We focus on Prediction-Powered Causal Inferences (PPCI), i.e., estimating the treatment effect in an unlabeled target experiment, relying on training data with the same outcome annotated but potentially different treatment or effect modifiers. We first show that conditional calibration guarantees valid PPCI at population level. Then, we introduce a sufficient representation constraint transferring validity across experiments, which we propose to enforce in practice in Deconfounded Empirical Risk Minimization, our new model-agnostic training objective. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world scientific data, solving impossible problem instances for Empirical Risk Minimization even with standard invariance constraints. In particular, for the first time, we achieve valid causal inference on a scientific experiment with complex recording and no human annotations, fine-tuning a foundational model on our similar annotated experiment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pai Liu, Lingfeng Zhao, Shivangi Agarwal, Jinghan Liu, Audrey Huang, Philip Amortila, Nan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Holdout validation and hyperparameter tuning from data is a long-standing problem in offline reinforcement learning (RL). A standard framework is to use off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods to evaluate and select the policies, but OPE either incurs exponential variance (e.g., importance sampling) or has hyperparameters on their own (e.g., FQE and model-based). We focus on hyperparameter tuning for OPE itself, which is even more under-investigated. Concretely, we select among candidate value functions ("model-free") or dynamics ("model-based") to best assess the performance of a target policy. Concretely, we select among candidate value functions (``model-free'') or dynamics models (``model-based'') to best assess the performance of a target policy. We develop: (1) new model-free and model-based selectors with theoretical guarantees, and (2) a new experimental protocol for empirically evaluating them. Compared to the model-free protocol in prior works, our new protocol allows for more stable generation and better control of candidate value functions in an optimization-free manner, and evaluation of model-free and model-based methods alike. We exemplify the protocol on Gym-Hopper, and find that our new model-free selector, LSTD-Tournament, demonstrates promising empirical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimiliano Ciranni, Vito Paolo Pastore, Roberto Di Via, Enzo Tartaglione, Francesca Odone, Vittorio Murino</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data whenever they are affected by strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels. This results in a form of bias affecting training data, which typically leads to unrecoverable weak generalization in prediction. This paper aims at facing this problem by leveraging bias amplification with generated synthetic data: we introduce Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods of unsupervised model debiasing exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models in data generation. Specifically, our approach adopts conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, which replace the original training set for learning an effective bias amplifier model that we subsequently incorporate into an end-to-end and a two-step unsupervised debiasing approach. By tackling the fundamental issue of bias-conflicting training samples memorization in learning auxiliary models, typical of this type of techniques, our proposed method beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling bias in deep learning models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan He, Peng Ye, Yuchen Ren, Yuan Yuan, Luyang Zhou, Shucun Ju, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a crucial method for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), with its effectiveness influenced by two key factors: rank selection and weight initialization. While numerous LoRA variants have been proposed to improve performance by addressing one of these aspects, they often compromise usability or computational efficiency. In this paper, we analyze and identify the core limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel framework--GoRA (Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation)--that simultaneously adapts both the rank and initialization strategy within a unified framework. GoRA leverages gradient information during training to dynamically assign optimal ranks and initialize low-rank adapter weights in an adaptive manner. To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only addresses the limitations of prior approaches--which often focus on either rank selection or initialization in isolation--but also unifies both aspects within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation. Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the efficiency of vanilla LoRA. For example, when fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Base for mathematical reasoning, GoRA achieves a 5.13-point improvement over standard LoRA and even outperforms full fine-tuning by 2.05 points under high-rank settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xander Davies, Eric Winsor, Alexandra Souly, Tomek Korbak, Robert Kirk, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Yarin Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM developers have imposed technical interventions to prevent fine-tuning misuse attacks, attacks where adversaries evade safeguards by fine-tuning the model using a public API. Previous work has established several successful attacks against specific fine-tuning API defences. In this work, we show that defences of fine-tuning APIs that seek to detect individual harmful training or inference samples ('pointwise' detection) are fundamentally limited in their ability to prevent fine-tuning attacks. We construct 'pointwise-undetectable' attacks that repurpose entropy in benign model outputs (e.g. semantic or syntactic variations) to covertly transmit dangerous knowledge. Our attacks are composed solely of unsuspicious benign samples that can be collected from the model before fine-tuning, meaning training and inference samples are all individually benign and low-perplexity. We test our attacks against the OpenAI fine-tuning API, finding they succeed in eliciting answers to harmful multiple-choice questions, and that they evade an enhanced monitoring system we design that successfully detects other fine-tuning attacks. We encourage the community to develop defences that tackle the fundamental limitations we uncover in pointwise fine-tuning API defences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Alouadi, Baptiste Barreau, Laurent Carlier, Huy\^en Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajad Movahedi, Felix Sarnthein, Nicola Muca Cirone, Antonio Orvieto</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have become promising alternatives to softmax-attention as sequence mixing layers in Transformer architectures. Current models, however, do not exhibit the full state-tracking expressivity of RNNs because they rely on channel-wise (i.e. diagonal) sequence mixing. In this paper, we investigate parameterizations of a large class of dense linear RNNs as fixed-points of parallelizable diagonal linear RNNs. The resulting models can naturally trade expressivity for efficiency at a fixed number of parameters and achieve state-of-the-art results on the state-tracking benchmarks $A_5$ and $S_5$, while matching performance on copying and other tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aref Einizade, Dorina Thanou, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros, Jhony H. Giraldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Simplicial complexes provide a powerful framework for modeling higher-order interactions in structured data, making them particularly suitable for applications such as trajectory prediction and mesh processing. However, existing simplicial neural networks (SNNs), whether convolutional or attention-based, rely primarily on discrete filtering techniques, which can be restrictive. In contrast, partial differential equations (PDEs) on simplicial complexes offer a principled approach to capture continuous dynamics in such structures. In this work, we introduce continuous simplicial neural network (COSIMO), a novel SNN architecture derived from PDEs on simplicial complexes. We provide theoretical and experimental justifications of COSIMO's stability under simplicial perturbations. Furthermore, we investigate the over-smoothing phenomenon, a common issue in geometric deep learning, demonstrating that COSIMO offers better control over this effect than discrete SNNs. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that COSIMO achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SNNs in complex and noisy environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Almod\'ovar, Adri\'an Javaloy, Juan Parras, Santiago Zazo, Isabel Valera</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DeCaFlow, a deconfounding causal generative model. Training once per dataset using just observational data and the underlying causal graph, DeCaFlow enables accurate causal inference on continuous variables under the presence of hidden confounders. Specifically, we extend previous results on causal estimation under hidden confounding to show that a single instance of DeCaFlow provides correct estimates for all causal queries identifiable with do-calculus, leveraging proxy variables to adjust for the causal effects when do-calculus alone is insufficient. Moreover, we show that counterfactual queries are identifiable as long as their interventional counterparts are identifiable, and thus are also correctly estimated by DeCaFlow. Our empirical results on diverse settings (including the Ecoli70 dataset, with 3 independent hidden confounders, tens of observed variables and hundreds of causal queries) show that DeCaFlow outperforms existing approaches, while demonstrating its out-of-the-box applicability to any given causal graph.

<p>Abstract: We prove that the list replicability number of $d$-dimensional $\gamma$-margin half-spaces satisfies \[ \frac{d}{2}+1 \le \mathrm{LR}(H^d_\gamma) \le d, \] which grows with dimension. This resolves several open problems:
  $\bullet$ Every disambiguation of infinite-dimensional large-margin half-spaces to a total concept class has unbounded Littlestone dimension, answering an open question of Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (FOCS '21).
  $\bullet$ Every disambiguation of the Gap Hamming Distance problem in the large gap regime has unbounded public-coin randomized communication complexity. This answers an open question of Fang, G\"o\"os, Harms, and Hatami (STOC '25).
  $\bullet$ There is a separation of $O(1)$ vs $\omega(1)$ between randomized and pseudo-deterministic communication complexity.
  $\bullet$ The maximum list-replicability number of any finite set of points and homogeneous half-spaces in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is $d$, resolving a problem of Chase, Moran, and Yehudayoff (FOCS '23).
  $\bullet$ There exists a partial concept class with Littlestone dimension $1$ such that all its disambiguations have infinite Littlestone dimension. This resolves a problem of Cheung, H. Hatami, P. Hatami, and Hosseini (ICALP '23).
  Our lower bound follows from a topological argument based on a local Borsuk-Ulam theorem. For the upper bound, we construct a list-replicable learning rule using the generalization properties of SVMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: For continuing tasks, average cost Markov decision processes have well-documented value and can be solved using efficient algorithms. However, it explicitly assumes that the agent is risk-neutral. In this work, we extend risk-neutral algorithms to accommodate the more general class of dynamic risk measures. Specifically, we propose a relative value iteration (RVI) algorithm for planning and design two model-free Q-learning algorithms, namely a generic algorithm based on the multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method, and an off-policy algorithm dedicated to utility-based shortfall risk measures. Both the RVI and MLMC-based Q-learning algorithms are proven to converge to optimality. Numerical experiments validate our analysis, confirm empirically the convergence of the off-policy algorithm, and demonstrate that our approach enables the identification of policies that are finely tuned to the intricate risk-awareness of the agent that they serve.</p>

<p>Abstract: The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Mora, Carlo Mazzocca, Rebecca Montanari, Paolo Bellavista</p>
<p>Abstract: The right to be forgotten is a fundamental principle of privacy-preserving regulations and extends to Machine Learning (ML) paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL). While FL enhances privacy by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data, trained models still retain the influence of training data. Federated Unlearning (FU) methods recently proposed often rely on impractical assumptions for real-world FL deployments, such as storing client update histories or requiring access to a publicly available dataset. To address these constraints, this paper introduces a novel method that leverages negated Pseudo-gradients Updates for Federated Unlearning (PUF). Our approach only uses standard client model updates, which are employed during regular FL rounds, and interprets them as pseudo-gradients. When a client needs to be forgotten, we apply the negation of their pseudo-gradients, appropriately scaled, to the global model. Unlike state-of-the-art mechanisms, PUF seamlessly integrates with FL workflows, incurs no additional computational and communication overhead beyond standard FL rounds, and supports concurrent unlearning requests. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on two well-known benchmark image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and a real-world medical imaging dataset for segmentation (ProstateMRI), using three different neural architectures: two residual networks and a vision transformer. The experimental results across various settings demonstrate that PUF achieves state-of-the-art forgetting effectiveness and recovery time, without relying on any additional assumptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> N. Sibuet, S. Ares de Parga, J. R. Bravo, R. Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed training framework for projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs). We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs.
  The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many domain experts do not have the time or expertise to write formal Bayesian models. This paper takes an informal problem description as input, and combines a large language model and a probabilistic programming language to define a joint distribution over formal models, latent variables, and data. A posterior over latent variables follows by conditioning on observed data and integrating over formal models. This presents a challenging inference problem. We suggest an inference recipe that amounts to generating many formal models from the large language model, performing approximate inference on each, and then doing a weighted average. This is justified and analyzed as a combination of self-normalized importance sampling, MCMC, and importance-weighted variational inference. Experimentally, this produces sensible predictions from only data and an informal problem description, without the need to specify a formal model.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study whether and how the choice of optimization algorithm can impact group fairness in deep neural networks. Through stochastic differential equation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup, we demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences fairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show that when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and stochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher likelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic category). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter updates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We then validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different tasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label classification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness definitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD in terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. Our results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked mechanism for promoting fair outcomes.

<p>Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6% (8.6% improvement beyond format correction), and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7% (7.0% non-format gain). This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which contains the aforementioned example. Furthermore, RLVR with only two examples even slightly exceeds these results (MATH500: 74.8%, average: 36.6%). Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples. In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-category generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. We also further discuss related observations about format correction, label robustness and prompt modification. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR efficiency and encourage a re-examination of recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sana Ayromlou, Fatemeh Tavakoli, D. B. Emerson</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an effective and widely used approach to training deep learning models on decentralized datasets held by distinct clients. FL also strengthens both security and privacy protections for training data. Common challenges associated with statistical heterogeneity between distributed datasets have spurred significant interest in personalized FL (pFL) methods, where models combine aspects of global learning with local modeling specific to each client's unique characteristics. This work investigates the efficacy of theoretically supported, adaptive MMD measures in pFL, primarily focusing on the Ditto framework, a state-of-the-art technique for distributed data heterogeneity. The use of such measures significantly improves model performance across a variety of tasks, especially those with pronounced feature heterogeneity. Additional experiments demonstrate that such measures are directly applicable to other pFL techniques and yield similar improvements across a number of datasets. Finally, the results motivate the use of constraints tailored to the various kinds of heterogeneity expected in FL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Cai, Shaohuai Liu, Chao Tian, Le Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models. Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Kranz, Davide Gallon, Steffen Dereich, Arnulf Jentzen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study gradient flows for loss landscapes of fully connected feedforward neural networks with commonly used continuously differentiable activation functions such as the logistic, hyperbolic tangent, softplus or GELU function. We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value. Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\varepsilon>0$ such that the loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\varepsilon$ above the optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our investigation to more realistic scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patryk Marsza{\l}ek, Tomasz Ku\'smierczyk, Witold Wydma\'nski, Jacek Tabor, Marek \'Smieja</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering tabular data remains a significant open challenge in data analysis and machine learning. Unlike for image data, similarity between tabular records often varies across datasets, making the definition of clusters highly dataset-dependent. Furthermore, the absence of supervised signals complicates hyperparameter tuning in deep learning clustering methods, frequently resulting in unstable performance. To address these issues and reduce the need for per-dataset tuning, we adopt an emerging approach in deep learning: zero-shot learning. We propose ZEUS, a self-contained model capable of clustering new datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. It operates by decomposing complex datasets into meaningful components that can then be clustered effectively. Thanks to pre-training on synthetic datasets generated from a latent-variable prior, it generalizes across various datasets without requiring user intervention. To the best of our knowledge, ZEUS is the first zero-shot method capable of generating embeddings for tabular data in a fully unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that it performs on par with or better than traditional clustering algorithms and recent deep learning-based methods, while being significantly faster and more user-friendly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghyeon Ki, JunHyeok Oh, Seong-Woong Shim, Byung-Jun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing, generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However, existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance, Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.Our code is available at https://github.com/ku-dmlab/PG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imon Banerjee, Sayak Chakrabarty</p>
<p>Abstract: The m-out-of-n bootstrap, originally proposed by Bickel, Gotze, and Zwet (1992), approximates the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing m subsamples (with m much smaller than n) without replacement from an original sample of size n. It is now routinely used for robust inference with heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications. Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.
  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance parameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by constructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the assumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact convergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap approximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by deriving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics, including the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of ergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our theory in modern estimation and learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixu Wu, Minghao Guo, Yuezhou Ma, Yuanxu Sun, Jianmin Wang, Wojciech Matusik, Mingsheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention with bias, which extends standard attention by introducing prior knowledge as an additive bias matrix to the query-key scores, has been widely deployed in vision, language, protein-folding and other advanced scientific models, underscoring its status as a key evolution of this foundational module. However, introducing bias terms creates a severe efficiency bottleneck in attention computation. It disrupts the tightly fused memory-compute pipeline that underlies the speed of accelerators like FlashAttention, thereby stripping away most of their performance gains and leaving biased attention computationally expensive. Surprisingly, despite its common usage, targeted efficiency optimization for attention with bias remains absent, which seriously hinders its application in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalizations. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$ speedup for Pairformer in AlphaFold 3, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoph J\"urgen Hemmer, Daniel Durstewitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelvin Kan, Xingjian Li, Benjamin J. Zhang, Tuhin Sahai, Stanley Osher, Markos A. Katsoulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We study Transformers through the perspective of optimal control theory, using tools from continuous-time formulations to derive actionable insights into training and architecture design. This framework improves the performance of existing Transformer models while providing desirable theoretical guarantees, including generalization and robustness. Our framework is designed to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with established Transformer models and requiring only slight changes to the implementation. We conduct seven extensive experiments on tasks motivated by text generation, sentiment analysis, image classification, and point cloud classification. Experimental results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines, while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using 42% fewer parameters. On GPT-2, our framework achieves a 9.3% reduction in final test loss, demonstrating scalability to larger models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies optimal control theory to both the training and architecture of Transformers. It offers a new foundation for systematic, theory-driven improvements and moves beyond costly trial-and-error approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Yan, Felix Mohr, Tom Viering</p>
<p>Abstract: Sample-wise learning curves plot performance versus training set size. They are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone (i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning curves including more modern learners (CatBoost, TabNet, RealMLP and TabPFN), we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe significant ill-behavior in approximately 15% of the learning curves, almost twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others. Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a challenging benchmark for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Garc\'ia-Castellanos, David R. Wessels, Nicky J. van den Berg, Remco Duits, Dani\"el M. Pelt, Erik J. Bekkers</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Eikonal Solvers, a novel framework that integrates Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) with Neural Eikonal Solvers. Our approach employs a single neural field where a unified shared backbone is conditioned on signal-specific latent variables - represented as point clouds in a Lie group - to model diverse Eikonal solutions. The ENF integration ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability. This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting Eikonal solution. By coupling these steerable representations with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our framework accurately models Eikonal travel-time solutions while generalizing to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds with regular group actions. This includes homogeneous spaces such as Euclidean, position-orientation, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. We validate our approach through applications in seismic travel-time modeling of 2D, 3D, and spherical benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, scalability, adaptability, and user controllability compared to existing Neural Operator-based Eikonal solver methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of incremental sequence classification, where predictions are updated as new elements in the sequence are revealed. Drawing on temporal-difference learning from reinforcement learning, we identify a temporal-consistency condition that successive predictions should satisfy. We leverage this condition to develop a novel loss function for training incremental sequence classifiers. Through a concrete example, we demonstrate that optimizing this loss can offer substantial gains in data efficiency. We apply our method to text classification tasks and show that it improves predictive accuracy over competing approaches on several benchmark datasets. We further evaluate our approach on the task of verifying large language model generations for correctness in grade-school math problems. Our results show that models trained with our method are better able to distinguish promising generations from unpromising ones after observing only a few tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Dheur, Souhaib Ben Taieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliably characterizing the full conditional distribution of a multivariate response variable given a set of covariates is crucial for trustworthy decision-making. However, misspecified or miscalibrated multivariate models may yield a poor approximation of the joint distribution of the response variables, leading to unreliable predictions and suboptimal decisions. Furthermore, standard recalibration methods are primarily limited to univariate settings, while conformal prediction techniques, despite generating multivariate prediction regions with coverage guarantees, do not provide a full probability density function. We address this gap by first introducing a novel notion of latent calibration, which assesses probabilistic calibration in the latent space of a conditional normalizing flow. Second, we propose latent recalibration (LR), a novel post-hoc model recalibration method that learns a transformation of the latent space with finite-sample bounds on latent calibration. Unlike existing methods, LR produces a recalibrated distribution with an explicit multivariate density function while remaining computationally efficient. Extensive experiments on both tabular and image datasets show that LR consistently improves latent calibration error and the negative log-likelihood of the recalibrated models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Zhu, Yang Qi, Hengyuan Ma, Wenlian Lu, Jianfeng Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) learning algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function with well-designed negative samples for contrastive learning. Existing goodness functions are typically defined as the sum of squared postsynaptic activations, neglecting correlated variability between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for noisy copies of individual inputs while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples.We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared output, which is equivalent to making predictions based on an energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> ShengYun Peng, Pin-Yu Chen, Jianfeng Chi, Seongmin Lee, Duen Horng Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping. In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence. Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning risks.

<p>Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a fundamental task in graph machine learning, with techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs) and specialized training procedures to tackle the distribution shift problem. Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA methods with much fewer training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Landon Butler, Abhineet Agarwal, Justin Singh Kang, Yigit Efe Erginbas, Bin Yu, Kannan Ramchandran</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX efficiently identifies the most influential features, providing a scalable approximation of their Shapley values. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task.</p>

While recent works have proposed algorithmic and architectural approaches to address this, the underlying cause of the performance drop remains unclear. In this paper, we identify the connection between the output of the encoder (a stack of convolutional layers) and the ensuing dense layers as the main underlying factor limiting scaling capabilities; we denote this connection as the bottleneck, and we demonstrate that previous approaches implicitly target this bottleneck. As a result of our analyses, we present global average pooling as a simple yet effective way of targeting the bottleneck, thereby avoiding the complexity of earlier approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Walker, Lingyi Yang, Nicola Muca Cirone, Cristopher Salvi, Terry Lyons</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces Structured Linear Controlled Differential Equations (SLiCEs), a unifying framework for sequence models with structured, input-dependent state-transition matrices that retain the maximal expressivity of dense matrices whilst being cheaper to compute. The framework encompasses existing architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel variants based on sparsity and the Walsh-Hadamard transform. We prove that, unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4D and Mamba, SLiCEs employing block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh-Hadamard matrices match the maximal expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$ state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and match the performance of log neural controlled differential equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Fujisawa, Masaki Adachi, Michael A. Osborne</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the importance of aligning language models with human preferences, crowd-sourced human feedback is often noisy -- for example, preferring less desirable responses -- posing a fundamental challenge to alignment. A truly robust alignment objective should yield identical model parameters even under severe label noise, a property known as redescending. We prove that no existing alignment methods satisfy this property. To address this, we propose H\"older-DPO, the first principled alignment loss with a provable redescending property, enabling estimation of the clean data distribution from noisy feedback. The aligned model estimates the likelihood of clean data, providing a theoretically grounded metric for dataset valuation that identifies the location and fraction of mislabels. This metric is gradient-free, enabling scalable and automated human feedback valuation without costly manual verification or clean validation dataset. H\"older-DPO achieves state-of-the-art robust alignment performance while accurately detecting mislabels in controlled datasets. Finally, applied to Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset, it reveals substantial noise levels and removing these mislabels significantly improves alignment performance across methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Collas, Ce Ju, Nicolas Salvy, Bertrand Thirion</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic brain connectivity matrices is key to analyzing population heterogeneity in brain organization, understanding disease, and augmenting data in challenging classification problems. Functional connectivity matrices lie in constrained spaces, such as the set of symmetric positive definite or correlation matrices, that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds. However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations (geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning, and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than 4600 scans from 2800 subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS-3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with over 30000 trials from 26 subjects (BNCI2014-002 and BNCI2015-001). It enables fast training and achieves state-of-the-art performance, all while preserving manifold constraints. Code: https://github.com/antoinecollas/DiffeoCFM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Liu, Ziyun Chen, Kun Wang, Haipeng Luo, Lillian J. Ratliff</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the Pandora's Box problem in an online learning setting with semi-bandit feedback. In each round, the learner sequentially pays to open up to $n$ boxes with unknown reward distributions, observes rewards upon opening, and decides when to stop. The utility of the learner is the maximum observed reward minus the cumulative cost of opened boxes, and the goal is to minimize regret defined as the gap between the cumulative expected utility and that of the optimal policy. We propose a new algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret after $T$ rounds, which improves the $\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{T})$ bound of Agarwal et al. [2024] and matches the known lower bound up to logarithmic factors. To better capture real-life applications, we then extend our results to a natural but challenging contextual linear setting, where each box's expected reward is linear in some known but time-varying $d$-dimensional context and the noise distribution is fixed over time. We design an algorithm that learns both the linear function and the noise distributions, achieving $\widetilde{O}(nd\sqrt{T})$ regret. Finally, we show that our techniques also apply to the online Prophet Inequality problem, where the learner must decide immediately whether or not to accept a revealed reward. In both non-contextual and contextual settings, our approach achieves similar improvements and regret bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Looped Transformers have been shown to empirically improve performance on reasoning tasks and to theoretically enhance expressivity by recursively increasing the number of computational steps. However, their comparative capabilities are still not well understood. In this paper, we provide a formal analysis of their respective strengths and limitations. We show that Looped Transformers can efficiently simulate parallel computations for deterministic tasks, which we formalize as evaluation over directed acyclic graphs. In contrast, CoT with stochastic decoding excels at approximate inference for compositional structures, namely self-reducible problems. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical cues for choosing between reasoning paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akiyoshi Tomihari, Ryo Karakida</p>
<p>Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19527">Rolling Ball Optimizer: Learning by ironing out loss landscape wrinkles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Djameleddine Belgoumri, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Hakim Hacid, Imran Razzak, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large neural networks (NNs) requires optimizing high-dimensional data-dependent loss functions. The optimization landscape of these functions is often highly complex and textured, even fractal-like, with many spurious local minima, ill-conditioned valleys, degenerate points, and saddle points. Complicating things further is the fact that these landscape characteristics are a function of the data, meaning that noise in the training data can propagate forward and give rise to unrepresentative small-scale geometry. This poses a difficulty for gradient-based optimization methods, which rely on local geometry to compute updates and are, therefore, vulnerable to being derailed by noisy data. In practice,this translates to a strong dependence of the optimization dynamics on the noise in the data, i.e., poor generalization performance. To remediate this problem, we propose a new optimization procedure: Rolling Ball Optimizer (RBO), that breaks this spatial locality by incorporating information from a larger region of the loss landscape in its updates. We achieve this by simulating the motion of a rigid sphere of finite radius rolling on the loss landscape, a straightforward generalization of Gradient Descent (GD) that simplifies into it in the infinitesimal limit. The radius serves as a hyperparameter that determines the scale at which RBO sees the loss landscape, allowing control over the granularity of its interaction therewith. We are motivated by the intuition that the large-scale geometry of the loss landscape is less data-specific than its fine-grained structure, and that it is easier to optimize. We support this intuition by proving that our algorithm has a smoothing effect on the loss function. Evaluation against SGD, SAM, and Entropy-SGD, on MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 demonstrates promising results in terms of convergence speed, training accuracy, and generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Herbert Woisetschl\"ager, Ryan Zhang, Shiqiang Wang, Hans-Arno Jacobsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-weight large language model (LLM) zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of $2\times$ cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: The role of hidden units in recurrent neural networks is typically seen as modeling memory, with research focusing on enhancing information retention through gating mechanisms. A less explored perspective views hidden units as active participants in the computation performed by the network, rather than passive memory stores. In this work, we revisit bilinear operations, which involve multiplicative interactions between hidden units and input embeddings. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that they constitute a natural inductive bias for representing the evolution of hidden states in state tracking tasks. These are the simplest type of tasks that require hidden units to actively contribute to the behavior of the network. We also show that bilinear state updates form a natural hierarchy corresponding to state tracking tasks of increasing complexity, with popular linear recurrent networks such as Mamba residing at the lowest-complexity center of that hierarchy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amon Lahr, Johannes K\"ohler, Anna Scampicchio, Melanie N. Zeilinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-conservative uncertainty bounds are key for both assessing an estimation algorithm's accuracy and in view of downstream tasks, such as its deployment in safety-critical contexts. In this paper, we derive a tight, non-asymptotic uncertainty bound for kernel-based estimation, which can also handle correlated noise sequences. Its computation relies on a mild norm-boundedness assumption on the unknown function and the noise, returning the worst-case function realization within the hypothesis class at an arbitrary query input location. The value of this function is shown to be given in terms of the posterior mean and covariance of a Gaussian process for an optimal choice of the measurement noise covariance. By rigorously analyzing the proposed approach and comparing it with other results in the literature, we show its effectiveness in returning tight and easy-to-compute bounds for kernel-based estimates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Sawarni, Sahasrajit Sarmasarkar, Vasilis Syrgkanis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation. While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unlocking deep and interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data remains a major AI challenge limiting scientific progress. While current DNA foundation models excel at representing sequences, they struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack transparent, biologically meaningful explanations. BioReason addresses this by tightly integrating a DNA foundation model with a large language model (LLM), enabling the LLM to directly interpret and reason over genomic information. Through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, BioReason learns to produce logical, biologically coherent deductions. It achieves major performance gains, boosting KEGG-based disease pathway prediction accuracy from 86% to 98% and improving variant effect prediction by an average of 15% over strong baselines. BioReason can reason over unseen biological entities and explain its decisions step by step, offering a transformative framework for interpretable, mechanistic AI in biology.

<p>Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhavya Vasudeva, Jung Whan Lee, Vatsal Sharan, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adam is the de facto optimization algorithm for several deep learning applications, but an understanding of its implicit bias and how it differs from other algorithms, particularly standard first-order methods such as (stochastic) gradient descent (GD), remains limited. In practice, neural networks (NNs) trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to find simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such simplicity bias. First, we investigate the differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer ReLU NNs on a binary classification task with Gaussian data. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting in a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to much richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is closer to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also allows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under certain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing the population gradients. Next, to corroborate our theoretical findings, we present extensive empirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior generalization across various datasets with spurious correlations where NNs trained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and do not generalize well under certain distributional shifts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently solving constrained optimization problems is crucial for numerous real-world applications, yet traditional solvers are often computationally prohibitive for real-time use. Machine learning-based approaches have emerged as a promising alternative to provide approximate solutions at faster speeds, but they struggle to strictly enforce constraints, leading to infeasible solutions in practice. To address this, we propose the Feasibility-Seeking Neural Network (FSNet), which integrates a feasibility-seeking step directly into its solution procedure to ensure constraint satisfaction. This feasibility-seeking step solves an unconstrained optimization problem that minimizes constraint violations in a differentiable manner, enabling end-to-end training and providing guarantees on feasibility and convergence. Our experiments across a range of different optimization problems, including both smooth/nonsmooth and convex/nonconvex problems, demonstrate that FSNet can provide feasible solutions with solution quality comparable to (or in some cases better than) traditional solvers, at significantly faster speeds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingting Zhang, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, David J. Love, Taejoon Kim, Kai Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Moulin, Emmanuel Esposito, Dirk van der Hoeven</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem setting of prediction with expert advice with possibly heavy-tailed losses, i.e.\ the only assumption on the losses is an upper bound on their second moments, denoted by $\theta$. We develop adaptive algorithms that do not require any prior knowledge about the range or the second moment of the losses. Existing adaptive algorithms have what is typically considered a lower-order term in their regret guarantees. We show that this lower-order term, which is often the maximum of the losses, can actually dominate the regret bound in our setting. Specifically, we show that even with small constant $\theta$, this lower-order term can scale as $\sqrt{KT}$, where $K$ is the number of experts and $T$ is the time horizon. We propose adaptive algorithms with improved regret bounds that avoid the dependence on such a lower-order term and guarantee $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\theta T\log(K)})$ regret in the worst case, and $\mathcal{O}(\theta \log(KT)/\Delta_{\min})$ regret when the losses are sampled i.i.d.\ from some fixed distribution, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the difference between the mean losses of the second best expert and the best expert. Additionally, when the loss function is the squared loss, our algorithm also guarantees improved regret bounds over prior results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chendi Qian, Christopher Morris</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world applications, ranging from training machine learning models to solving integer linear programs. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, thereby reducing the need to solve many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, thereby pretraining MPNNs for improved performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.</p>

In this work, we introduce CogniAlign, a multimodal architecture for Alzheimer's detection that integrates audio and textual modalities, two non-intrusive sources of information that offer complementary insights into cognitive health. Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions. To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by the superior unimodal performance of the text modality. In addition, we incorporate prosodic cues, specifically interword pauses, by inserting pause tokens into the text and generating audio embeddings for silent intervals, further enriching both streams. We evaluate CogniAlign on the ADReSSo dataset, where it achieves an accuracy of 87.35% over a Leave-One-Subject-Out setup and of 90.36% over a 5 fold Cross-Validation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study confirms the advantages of our alignment strategy, attention-based fusion, and prosodic modeling. Finally, we perform a corpus analysis to assess the impact of the proposed prosodic features and apply Integrated Gradients to identify the most influential input segments used by the model in predicting cognitive health outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiusheng Huang, Yuan Niu, Xiaohui Zhong, Anboyu Guo, Lei Chen, Dianjun Zhang, Xuefeng Zhang, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution ocean forecasting is crucial for maritime operations and environmental monitoring. While traditional numerical models are capable of producing sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they are computationally intensive and face challenges in maintaining accuracy at fine spatial and temporal scales. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches offer improved computational efficiency and emerging potential, yet typically operate at daily resolution and struggle with sub-daily predictions due to error accumulation over time. We introduce FuXi-Ocean, the first data-driven global ocean forecasting model achieving six-hourly predictions at eddy-resolving 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution, reaching depths of up to 1500 meters. The model architecture integrates a context-aware feature extraction module with a predictive network employing stacked attention blocks. The core innovation is the Mixture-of-Time (MoT) module, which adaptively integrates predictions from multiple temporal contexts by learning variable-specific reliability , mitigating cumulative errors in sequential forecasting. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, FuXi-Ocean demonstrates superior skill in predicting key variables, including temperature, salinity, and currents, across multiple depths.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training. Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks, including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnav Kumar Jain, Vibhakar Mohta, Subin Kim, Atiksh Bhardwaj, Juntao Ren, Yunhai Feng, Sanjiban Choudhury, Gokul Swamy</p>
<p>Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach SAILOR consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10x still leaves a performance gap. We find that SAILOR can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florentin Guth, Zahra Kadkhodaie, Eero P Simoncelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized} energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective, ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64 dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: log probabilities estimated with two networks trained on non-overlapping data subsets are nearly identical. Finally, we demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary substantially depending on image content, in contrast with conventional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a low-dimensional manifold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Sun, Jingyan Shen, Yibin Wang, Tianyu Chen, Zhendong Wang, Mingyuan Zhou, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruce W. Lee, Addie Foote, Alex Infanger, Leni Shor, Harish Kamath, Jacob Goldman-Wetzler, Bryce Woodworth, Alex Cloud, Alexander Matt Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust. A few steps of finetuning can revert their effects. We begin by showing that this is true even for an idealized form of unlearning: training to imitate a model that was never trained on unwanted information. This shows that training a model can drastically modify its input-output behavior while leaving its underlying capabilities intact. In light of this dynamic, we show our main result. Training a randomly initialized student on the outputs of an unlearned model transfers behaviors while leaving latent capabilities behind. In short, distillation robustifies unlearning. Based on this result, we propose Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an unlearned model into a noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting, UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability removal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Kunin, Giovanni Luca Marchetti, Feng Chen, Dhruva Karkada, James B. Simon, Michael R. DeWeese, Surya Ganguli, Nina Miolane</p>
<p>Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each iteration, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these drops, matching experiments across several commonly studied architectures. We show that AGF unifies and extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization. Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude. Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning in neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements. Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation performance of Adam within 44-58% of the gradient steps and 62-83% of the wallclock time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Hariri, \'Alvaro Arroyo, Alessio Gravina, Moshe Eliasof, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Davide Bacciu, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Xiaowen Dong, Pierre Vandergheynst</p>
<p>Abstract: ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions, positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks, Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physically-based causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a novel approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ejafa Bassam, Dawei Zhu, Kaigui Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation, it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically, this term is either a KL divergence that matches marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss that captures intra- and inter-class relationships. In every case, it acts as an additional term to cross-entropy. This term has its own weight, which must be carefully tuned. In this paper, we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce "Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD)", a weighted list-wise ranking loss. In PLD, the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single "teacher-optimal" ranking. The true label is placed first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence. This process yields a convex and translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically, across CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS-COCO, PLD achieves consistent gains across diverse architectures and distillation objectives, including divergence-based, correlation-based, and feature-based methods, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher-student pairs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is crucial to many location-based services. Despite tremendous progress in modeling dynamics of human activity, most existing methods overlook physical constraints of spatial interaction, leading to uninterpretable spatial correlations and over-smoothing phenomenon. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by integrating the universal law of gravitation to refine transformer attention. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on spatiotemporal embedding feature, (2) models the spatial interaction in end-to-end neural network using proposed adaptive gravity model to learn the physical constraint, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our model over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be not only disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws, but also improved the generalization in zero-shot cross-region inference. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuheng Zhang, Tim Pearce, Pushi Zhang, Kaixin Wang, Xiaoyu Chen, Wei Shen, Li Zhao, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However, differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations, actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.</p>

We model this problem in the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Yang, Zhen Zhang, Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan, Jing Liu, Nathan Susanj, Zheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.</p>

Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal risk-averse value function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunta Nonaga, Koji Tabata, Yuta Mizuno, Tamiki Komatsuzaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making: maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making tasks in uncertain environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data. While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates robust generalization under system misspecification between training and deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Redhardt, Yassir Akram, Simon Schug</p>
<p>Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds across different task encodings as long as the training distribution sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minchan Jeong, J. Jon Ryu, Se-Young Yun, Gregory W. Wornell</p>
<p>Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyang Li, Zhiyuan Zhou, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alvaro H. C. Correia, Christos Louizos</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method that has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its finite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split conformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to collecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet seen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate arbitrary distribution shifts, offering a principled and broadly applicable solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile Anand, Sarah Liaw</p>
<p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with \emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems -- has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off: larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source code for all our experiments in https://github.com/SarahLiaw/ctx-bandits-mcmc-showdown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Huang, Peng Lu, Qiuhao Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning, featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as a preprocessing step can, in many cases, improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy consumption, with observed reductions of up to 38x.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04048">Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishnakanta Barik, Goutam Paul</p>
<p>Abstract: The \textit{Temporal Fusion Transformer} (TFT), proposed by Lim \textit{et al.}, published in \textit{International Journal of Forecasting} (2021), is a state-of-the-art attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. The core idea of this work is inspired by the foundation studies, \textit{The Power of Quantum Neural Networks} by Amira Abbas \textit{et al.} and \textit{Quantum Vision Transformers} by El Amine Cherrat \textit{et al.}, published in \textit{ Nature Computational Science} (2021) and \textit{Quantum} (2024), respectively. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results on two different datasets display that the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss. These results indicate the prospect of using quantum computing to boost deep learning architectures in complex machine learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengao Zhang, Jiayu Fu, Tanya Warrier, Yuwen Wang, Tianhui Tan, Ke-wei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwoo Kwon, Seong Hoon Seo, Jae W. Lee, Yeonhong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models (LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy? Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding steps. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongseok Kim, Wonjun Jeong, Gisung Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Anti-regularization introduces a reward term with a reversed sign into the loss function, deliberately amplifying model expressivity in small-sample regimes while ensuring that the intervention gradually vanishes as the sample size grows through a power-law decay schedule. We formalize spectral safety conditions and trust-region constraints, and we design a lightweight safeguard that combines a projection operator with gradient clipping to guarantee stable intervention. Theoretical analysis extends to linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, providing practical guidance on the choice of decay exponents through the balance between empirical risk and variance. Empirical results show that Anti-regularization mitigates underfitting in both regression and classification while preserving generalization and improving calibration. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and safeguards are essential to avoiding overfitting and instability. As an alternative, we also propose a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that maintains constant per-sample complexity. Anti-regularization constitutes a simple and reproducible procedure that integrates seamlessly into standard empirical risk minimization pipelines, enabling robust learning under limited data and resource constraints by intervening only when necessary and vanishing otherwise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Cerutti</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochuan Gong, Jie Hao, Mingrui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical optimization refers to problems with interdependent decision variables and objectives, such as minimax and bilevel formulations. While various algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack adaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal convergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior knowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive algorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization problems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp convergence rates of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$ in $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\bar{\sigma}$ is an upper bound on the stochastic gradient noise. Notably, these rates are obtained without prior knowledge of the noise level, thereby enabling automatic adaptivity in both low and high-noise regimes. To our knowledge, this work provides the first adaptive and sharp convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical optimization. Our algorithm design combines the momentum normalization technique with novel adaptive parameter choices. Extensive experiments on synthetic and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepehr Dehdashtian, Mashrur M. Morshed, Jacob H. Seidman, Gaurav Bharaj, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic image detectors (SIDs) are a key defense against the risks posed by the growing realism of images from text-to-image (T2I) models. Red teaming improves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes via misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i) require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs, based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by (i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation, reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors (up to 30%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Sharma, Amit Jayant Deshpande, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Rajiv Ratn Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes. Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families (e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g., occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Han, Linara Adilova, Henning Petzka, Jens Kleesiek, Michael Kamp</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural collapse, i.e., the emergence of highly symmetric, class-wise clustered representations, is frequently observed in deep networks and is often assumed to reflect or enable generalization. In parallel, flatness of the loss landscape has been theoretically and empirically linked to generalization. Yet, the causal role of either phenomenon remains unclear: Are they prerequisites for generalization, or merely by-products of training dynamics? We disentangle these questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization precedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from training dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative flatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently predicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing generalize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions exhibit delayed generalization, resembling grokking, even in architectures and datasets where it does not typically occur. Furthermore, we show theoretically that neural collapse leads to relative flatness under classical assumptions, explaining their empirical co-occurrence. Our results support the view that relative flatness is a potentially necessary and more fundamental property for generalization, and demonstrate how grokking can serve as a powerful probe for isolating its geometric underpinnings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However, developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic reinforcement learning framework MobileRL to enhance GUI agents in mobile environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-ADAptive GRPO (ADAGRPO) algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties. We introduce the shortest-path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both AndroidWorld (80.2%) and AndroidLab (53.6%).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Lu, Jerry Huang, Qiuhao Zeng, Xinyu Wang, Boxing Chen, Philippe Langlais, Yufei Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension. Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition matrices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daphne Theodorakopoulos, Elisabeth Eberling, Miriam Bodenheimer, Sabine Loos, Frederic Stahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible, unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability, visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future updates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vansh Ramani, Alexis Schlomer, Akash Nayar, Sayan Ranu, Jignesh M. Patel, Panagiotis Karras</p>
<p>Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Wei, Chunchun Chen, Rui Fan, Xiaofeng Cao, Sourav Medya, Wei Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs (TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs. Our code is be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyi Tong, Olivia Nocentini, Marta Lagomarsino, Kuanqi Cai, Marta Lorenzini, Arash Ajoudani</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Gr\"afe, Fabian Mager, Marco Zimmerling, Sebastian Trimpe</p>
<p>Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning. Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with state-of-the-art accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunsu Kim, Jonggeon Park, Joan Bruna, Hongseok Yang, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience, finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p>

Theoretical analysis confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young In Kim, Andrea Agiollo, Rajiv Khanna</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii) useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Fan, Arnab Maiti, Kevin Jamieson, Lillian J. Ratliff, Gabriele Farina</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t \rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems, including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after $T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical $K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret guarantees for DAGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet effective exploration strategy for contextual bandits that injects randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear contextual bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with the near-optimal regret guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Nicola Paoletti, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models, but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set, it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based (CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA) to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate, and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyu Qian, Su Nguyen, Chao Chen, Qinyue Zhou, Liyuan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method first extracts compact feature representations from image observations, performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in high-dimensional, multi-action settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sehyun Park, Jongjin Lee, Yunseop Shin, Ilsang Ohn, Yongdai Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification, but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and distribution shift problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephan Rabanser, Nicolas Papernot</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration -- often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking. Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal oracle behavior more closely.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even 7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as reliable collaborators in CS research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sishun Liu, Ke Deng, Yongli Ren, Yan Wang, Xiuzhen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction, especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Lin, Aocheng Ding, Tengfei Ma, Hua Liang, Zhe Quan</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the global structural context.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Simchi-Levi, Zeyu Zheng, Feng Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the optimal trade-off between expectation and tail risk for regret distribution in the stochastic multi-armed bandit model. We fully characterize the interplay among three desired properties for policy design: worst-case optimality, instance-dependent consistency, and light-tailed risk. New policies are proposed to characterize the optimal regret tail probability for any regret threshold. In particular, we discover an intrinsic gap of the optimal tail rate depending on whether the time horizon $T$ is known a priori or not. Interestingly, when it comes to the purely worst-case scenario, this gap disappears. Our results reveal insights on how to design policies that balance between efficiency and safety, and highlight extra insights on policy robustness with regard to policy hyper-parameters and model mis-specification. We also conduct a simulation study to validate our theoretical insights and provide practical amendment to our policies. Finally, we discuss extensions of our results to (i) general sub-exponential environments and (ii) general stochastic linear bandits. Furthermore, we find that a special case of our policy design surprisingly coincides with what was adopted in AlphaGo Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our theory provides high-level insights to why their engineered solution is successful and should be advocated in complex decision-making environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bushra Sabir (CSIRO's Data61), Yansong Gao (The University of Western Australia), Alsharif Abuadbba (CSIRO's Data61), M. Ali Babar (The University of Adelaide, CREST- The Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technologies)</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based text classifiers such as BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT have shown strong performance in natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. These vulnerabilities raise significant security concerns, as small input perturbations can cause severe misclassifications. Existing robustness methods often require heavy computation or lack interpretability. This paper presents a unified framework called Explainability-driven Detection, Identification, and Transformation (EDIT) to strengthen inference-time defenses. EDIT integrates explainability tools, including attention maps and integrated gradients, with frequency-based features to automatically detect and identify adversarial perturbations while offering insight into model behavior. After detection, EDIT refines adversarial inputs using an optimal transformation process that leverages pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to replace corrupted tokens. To enhance security assurance, EDIT incorporates automated alerting mechanisms that involve human analysts when necessary.
  Beyond static defenses, EDIT also provides adaptive resilience by enforcing internal feature similarity and transforming inputs, thereby disrupting the attackers optimization process and limiting the effectiveness of adaptive adversarial attacks. Experiments using BERT and RoBERTa on IMDB, YELP, AGNEWS, and SST2 datasets against seven word substitution attacks demonstrate that EDIT achieves an average Fscore of 89.69 percent and balanced accuracy of 89.70 percent. Compared to four state-of-the-art defenses, EDIT improves balanced accuracy by 1.22 times and F1-score by 1.33 times while being 83 times faster in feature extraction. The framework provides robust, interpretable, and efficient protection against both standard, zero-day, and adaptive adversarial threats in text classification models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Eric Darve, Stephen Boyd</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider multilevel low rank (MLR) matrices, defined as a row and column permutation of a sum of matrices, each one a block diagonal refinement of the previous one, with all blocks low rank given in factored form. MLR matrices extend low rank matrices but share many of their properties, such as the total storage required and complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We address three problems that arise in fitting a given matrix by an MLR matrix in the Frobenius norm. The first problem is factor fitting, where we adjust the factors of the MLR matrix. The second is rank allocation, where we choose the ranks of the blocks in each level, subject to the total rank having a given value, which preserves the total storage needed for the MLR matrix. The final problem is to choose the hierarchical partition of rows and columns, along with the ranks and factors. This paper is accompanied by an open source package that implements the proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Oliaro, Xupeng Miao, Xinhao Cheng, Vineeth Kada, Mengdi Wu, Ruohan Gao, Yingyi Huang, Remi Delacourt, April Yang, Yingcheng Wang, Colin Unger, Zhihao Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for task adaptation, yet today's serving stacks isolate inference and finetuning on separate GPU clusters -- wasting resources and under-utilizing hardware. We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. FlexLLM's static compilation optimizations -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM maintains inference SLO compliance at up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by $1.9-4.8\times$ under heavy inference workloads and $2.5-6.8\times$ under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes M\"uller, Semih Cayci</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization in infinite-horizon, discrete, discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. This is in contrast to previously known estimates, of the order $O(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the regularization strength. We provide a lower bound matching our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Chen, Chen Tang, Jianglan Wei, Chenran Li, Ran Tian, Xiang Zhang, Wei Zhan, Peter Stone, Masayoshi Tomizuka</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongji Wu, Wenjie Qu, Xueshen Liu, Tianyang Tao, Yifan Qiao, Zhuang Wang, Wei Bai, Yuan Tian, Jiaheng Zhang, Z. Morley Mao, Matthew Lentz, Danyang Zhuo, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has increasingly been adopted to further scale large language models (LLMs). However, frequent failures still pose significant challenges as training scales. The cost of even a single failure is significant, as all GPUs need to idle wait until the failure is resolved, potentially losing considerable training progress as training has to restart from checkpoints. This problem is exacerbated by the growing use of spot instances on public clouds for model training, which despite offering substantial cost savings, introduce frequent preemptions-essentially failures that regularly occur throughout the training process. Existing solutions for efficient fault-tolerant training either lack elasticity or rely on building resiliency into pipeline parallelism, which cannot be applied to MoE models due to the expert parallelism strategy adopted by the MoE architecture.
  We present Lazarus, a system for resilient and elastic training of MoE models. Lazarus adaptively allocates expert replicas to address the inherent imbalance in expert workload and speeds up training, while a provably optimal expert placement algorithm is developed to maximize the probability of recovery upon failures. Through adaptive expert placement and a flexible token dispatcher, Lazarus can also fully utilize all available nodes after failures, leaving no GPU idle. Our evaluation shows that Lazarus outperforms existing MoE training systems by up to 5.7x under frequent node failures and 3.4x on a real spot instance trace.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Kozdoba, Binyamin Perets, Shie Mannor</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a well known intrinsic trade-off between the fairness of a representation and the performance of classifiers derived from the representation. Due to the complexity of optimisation algorithms in most modern representation learning approaches, for a given method it may be non-trivial to decide whether the obtained fairness-performance curve of the method is optimal, i.e., whether it is close to the true Pareto front for these quantities for the underlying data distribution.
  In this paper we propose a new method to compute the optimal Pareto front, which does not require the training of complex representation models. We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods.
  Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared. We experimentally evaluate the approach on a number of real world benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josip Juki\'c, Jan \v{S}najder</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform few-shot learning by conditioning on labeled examples in the prompt. Despite its flexibility, ICL suffers from instability -- especially as prompt length increases with more demonstrations. To address this, we treat ICL as a source of weak supervision and propose a parameter-efficient method that disentangles demonstration-induced latent shifts from those of the query. An ICL-based teacher generates pseudo-labels on unlabeled queries, while a student predicts them using only the query input, updating a lightweight adapter. This captures demonstration effects in a compact, reusable form, enabling efficient inference while remaining composable with new demonstrations. Although trained on noisy teacher outputs, the student often outperforms its teacher through pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, consistent with the weak-to-strong generalization effect. Empirically, our method improves generalization, stability, and efficiency across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, surpassing standard ICL and prior disentanglement methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Xu, Mengcheng Lan, Xia Dong, Kai He, Wei Zhang, Qingtian Bian, Yiping Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of neuroscience, identifying distinctive patterns associated with neurological disorders via brain networks is crucial. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a primary tool for mapping these networks by correlating blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different brain regions, defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Constructing these brain networks involves using atlases to parcellate the brain into ROIs based on various hypotheses of brain division. However, there is no standard atlas for brain network classification, leading to limitations in detecting abnormalities in disorders. Some recent methods have proposed utilizing multiple atlases, but they neglect consistency across atlases and lack ROI-level information exchange. To tackle these limitations, we propose an Atlas-Integrated Distillation and Fusion network (AIDFusion) to improve brain network classification using fMRI data. AIDFusion addresses the challenge of utilizing multiple atlases by employing a disentangle Transformer to filter out inconsistent atlas-specific information and distill distinguishable connections across atlases. It also incorporates subject- and population-level consistency constraints to enhance cross-atlas consistency. Additionally, AIDFusion employs an inter-atlas message-passing mechanism to fuse complementary information across brain regions. Experimental results on four datasets of different diseases demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AIDFusion compared to state-of-the-art methods. A case study illustrates AIDFusion extract patterns that are both interpretable and consistent with established neuroscience findings.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10587">TopoFR: A Closer Look at Topology Alignment on Face Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Dan, Yang Liu, Jiankang Deng, Haoyu Xie, Siyuan Li, Baigui Sun, Shan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Vafaii, Dekel Galor, Jacob L. Yates</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference in both brains and machines can be formalized by optimizing a shared objective: maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in machine learning, or minimizing variational free energy (F) in neuroscience (ELBO = -F). While this equivalence suggests a unifying framework, it leaves open how inference is implemented in neural systems. Here, we introduce FOND (Free energy Online Natural-gradient Dynamics), a framework that derives neural inference dynamics from three principles: (1) natural gradients on F, (2) online belief updating, and (3) iterative refinement. We apply FOND to derive iP-VAE (iterative Poisson variational autoencoder), a recurrent spiking neural network that performs variational inference through membrane potential dynamics, replacing amortized encoders with iterative inference updates. Theoretically, iP-VAE yields several desirable features such as emergent normalization via lateral competition, and hardware-efficient integer spike count representations. Empirically, iP-VAE outperforms both standard VAEs and Gaussian-based predictive coding models in sparsity, reconstruction, and biological plausibility, and scales to complex color image datasets such as CelebA. iP-VAE also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution inputs, exceeding hybrid iterative-amortized VAEs. These results demonstrate how deriving inference algorithms from first principles can yield concrete architectures that are simultaneously biologically plausible and empirically effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunji Kim, Sriya Mantena, Weiwei Yang, Chandan Singh, Sungroh Yoon, Jianfeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: While large transformer models excel in predictive performance, their lack of interpretability restricts their usefulness in high-stakes domains. To remedy this, we propose the Generalized Induction-Head Model (GIM), an interpretable model for next-token prediction inspired by the observation of "induction heads" in LLMs. GIM is a retrieval-based module that identifies similar sequences in the input context by combining exact n-gram matching and fuzzy matching based on a neural similarity metric. We evaluate GIM in two settings: language modeling and fMRI response prediction. In language modeling, GIM improves next-token prediction by up to 25%p over interpretable baselines, significantly narrowing the gap with black-box LLMs. In an fMRI setting, GIM improves neural response prediction by 20% and offers insights into the language selectivity of the brain. GIM represents a significant step toward uniting interpretability and performance across domains. The code is available at https://github.com/ejkim47/generalized-induction-head.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pravesh K. Kothari, Ankur Moitra, Alexander S. Wein</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by connections between algebraic complexity lower bounds and tensor decompositions, we investigate Koszul-Young flattenings, which are the main ingredient in recent lower bounds for matrix multiplication. Based on this tool we give a new algorithm for decomposing an $n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3$ tensor as the sum of a minimal number of rank-1 terms, and certifying uniqueness of this decomposition. For $n_1 \le n_2 \le n_3$ with $n_1 \to \infty$ and $n_3/n_2 = O(1)$, our algorithm is guaranteed to succeed when the tensor rank is bounded by $r \le (1-\epsilon)(n_2 + n_3)$ for an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, provided the tensor components are generically chosen. For any fixed $\epsilon$, the runtime is polynomial in $n_3$. When $n_2 = n_3 = n$, our condition on the rank gives a factor-of-2 improvement over the classical simultaneous diagonalization algorithm, which requires $r \le n$, and also improves on the recent algorithm of Koiran (2024) which requires $r \le 4n/3$. It also improves on the PhD thesis of Persu (2018) which solves rank detection for $r \leq 3n/2$.
  We complement our upper bounds by showing limitations, in particular that no flattening of the style we consider can surpass rank $n_2 + n_3$. Furthermore, for $n \times n \times n$ tensors, we show that an even more general class of degree-$d$ polynomial flattenings cannot surpass rank $Cn$ for a constant $C = C(d)$. This suggests that for tensor decompositions, the case of generic components may be fundamentally harder than that of random components, where efficient decomposition is possible even in highly overcomplete settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathurin Videau, Alessandro Leite, Marc Schoenauer, Olivier Teytaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promising potential for parameter-efficient scaling across domains. However, their application to image classification remains limited, often requiring billion-scale datasets to be competitive. In this work, we explore the integration of MoE layers into image classification architectures using open datasets. We conduct a systematic analysis across different MoE configurations and model scales. We find that moderate parameter activation per sample provides the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, as the number of activated parameters increases, the benefits of MoE diminish. Our analysis yields several practical insights for vision MoE design. First, MoE layers most effectively strengthen tiny and mid-sized models, while gains taper off for large-capacity networks and do not redefine state-of-the-art ImageNet performance. Second, a Last-2 placement heuristic offers the most robust cross-architecture choice, with Every-2 slightly better for Vision Transform (ViT), and both remaining effective as data and model scale increase. Third, larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-21k) allow more experts, up to 16, for ConvNeXt to be utilized effectively without changing placement, as increased data reduces overfitting and promotes broader expert specialization. Finally, a simple linear router performs best, suggesting that additional routing complexity yields no consistent benefit.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meera Hahn, Wenjun Zeng, Nithish Kannen, Rich Galt, Kartikeya Badola, Been Kim, Zi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enshu Liu, Xuefei Ning, Yu Wang, Zinan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text and image generation but suffer from slow generation due to the token-by-token process. We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tam Le, Truyen Nguyen, Hideitsu Hino, Kenji Fukumizu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate optimal transport (OT) for measures on graph metric spaces with different total masses. To mitigate the limitations of traditional $L^p$ geometry, Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and generalized Sobolev transport (GST) employ Orlicz geometric structure, leveraging convex functions to capture nuanced geometric relationships and remarkably contribute to advance certain machine learning approaches. However, both OW and GST are restricted to measures with equal total mass, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where mass variation is common, and input measures may have noisy supports, or outliers. To address unbalanced measures, OW can either incorporate mass constraints or marginal discrepancy penalization, but this leads to a more complex two-level optimization problem. Additionally, GST provides a scalable yet rigid framework, which poses significant challenges to extend GST to accommodate nonnegative measures. To tackle these challenges, in this work we revisit the entropy partial transport (EPT) problem. By exploiting Caffarelli & McCann (2010)'s insights, we develop a novel variant of EPT endowed with Orlicz geometric structure, called Orlicz-EPT. We establish theoretical background to solve Orlicz-EPT using a binary search algorithmic approach. Especially, by leveraging the dual EPT and the underlying graph structure, we formulate a novel regularization approach that leads to the proposed Orlicz-Sobolev transport (OST). Notably, we demonstrate that OST can be efficiently computed by simply solving a univariate optimization problem, in stark contrast to the intensive computation needed for Orlicz-EPT. Building on this, we derive geometric structures for OST and draw its connections to other transport distances. We empirically illustrate that OST is several-order faster than Orlicz-EPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Yu, Edith Cohen, Badih Ghazi, Yangsibo Huang, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Daogao Liu, Chiyuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose $SCONE$ ($S$calable, $C$ontextualized, $O$ffloaded, $N$-gram $E$mbedding), a new method for extending input embedding layers to enhance language model performance. To avoid increased decoding costs, $SCONE$ retains the original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for a set of frequent n-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each input token and are learned with a separate model during training. After training, embeddings are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory; during inference, querying them has minimal impact on latency due to the low complexity of embedding lookups. $SCONE$ enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of n-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, both while maintaining fixed accelerator usage during inference (in terms of FLOPS and memory). We show that scaling both aspects enables a model with 1B accelerator-resident parameters to outperform a 1.9B-parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only about half the FLOPS and accelerator memory during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R. Burt, Renato Berlinghieri, Stephen Bates, Tamara Broderick</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating associations between spatial covariates and responses - rather than merely predicting responses - is central to environmental science, epidemiology, and economics. For instance, public health officials might be interested in whether air pollution has a strictly positive association with a health outcome, and the magnitude of any effect. Standard machine learning methods often provide accurate predictions but offer limited insight into covariate-response relationships. And we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals for associations can fail to provide nominal coverage in the face of model misspecification and nonrandom locations - despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. We introduce a method that constructs valid frequentist confidence intervals for associations in spatial settings. Our method requires minimal assumptions beyond a form of spatial smoothness and a homoskedastic Gaussian error assumption. In particular, we do not require model correctness or covariate overlap between training and target locations. Our approach is the first to guarantee nominal coverage in this setting and outperforms existing techniques in both real and simulated experiments. Our confidence intervals are valid in finite samples when the noise of the Gaussian error is known, and we provide an asymptotically consistent estimation procedure for this noise variance when it is unknown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Prato, Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Shagun Sodhani, Sarath Chandar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as highly capable systems and are increasingly being integrated into various uses. However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunmo Kang, Abdulkadir Canatar, SueYeon Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding representational similarity between neural recordings and computational models is essential for neuroscience, yet remains challenging to measure reliably due to the constraints on the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously. In this work, we apply tools from Random Matrix Theory to investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We propose an analytical framework for representational similarity analysis that relates measured similarities to the spectral properties of the underlying representations. We demonstrate that neural similarities are systematically underestimated under finite neuron sampling, mainly due to eigenvector delocalization. Moreover, for power-law population spectra, we show that the number of localized eigenvectors scales as the square root of the number of recorded neurons, providing a simple rule of thumb for practitioners. To overcome sampling bias, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples. Theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic and real datasets, offering practical strategies for interpreting neural data under finite sampling constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Chen, Oriol Mayn\'e i Comas, Zhuotao Jin, Di Luo, Marin Solja\v{c}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a universal theoretical framework for understanding long-context language modeling based on a bipartite mutual information scaling law that we rigorously verify in natural language. We demonstrate that bipartite mutual information captures multi-token interactions distinct from and scaling independently of conventional two-point mutual information, and show that this provides a more complete characterization of the dependencies needed for accurately modeling long sequences. Leveraging this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L$^2$M) condition, which lower bounds the necessary scaling of a model's history state -- the latent variables responsible for storing past information -- for effective long-context modeling. We validate the framework and its predictions on transformer and state-space models. Our work provides a principled foundation to understand long-context modeling and to design more efficient architectures with stronger long-context capabilities, with potential applications beyond natural language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon A. Aytes, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step problem solving, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in intermediate outputs, leading to increased computational overhead. We propose Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a prompting framework that integrates cognitively inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to reduce token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 18 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 84% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Augusto B. Corr\^ea, Andr\'e G. Pereira, Jendrik Seipp</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems. However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaihoon Kim, Taehoon Yoon, Jisung Hwang, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyuan Mao, Haoran Xu, Amy Zhang, Weinan Zhang, Chenjia Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuran Meng, Yi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep neural networks (DNNs) are used for prediction, inference on DNN-estimated subject-specific means for categorical or exponential family outcomes remains underexplored. We address this by proposing a DNN estimator under generalized nonparametric regression models (GNRMs) and developing a rigorous inference framework. Unlike existing approaches that assume independence between estimation errors and inputs to establish the error bound, a condition often violated in GNRMs, we allow for dependence and our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of drawing inference under GNRMs. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM) that leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct reliable confidence intervals for DNN estimates. We show that, under GNRM settings, ESM enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for heterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through simulations under nonparametric logistic, Poisson, and binomial regression models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. We further apply the method to the electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) dataset, a large scale collection of anonymized health records from ICU patients, to predict ICU readmission risk and offer patient-centric insights for clinical decision making.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate tasks that can be accomplished with unlabelled graphs, which are graphs with nodes that do not have attached persistent or semantically meaningful labels. New visualization techniques to represent unlabelled graphs have been proposed, but more understanding of unlabelled graph tasks is required before these techniques can be adequately evaluated. Some tasks apply to both labelled and unlabelled graphs, but many do not translate between these contexts. We propose a data abstraction model that distinguishes the Unlabelled context from the increasingly semantically rich Labelled, Attributed, and Augmented contexts. We filter tasks collected and gleaned from the literature according to our data abstraction and analyze the surfaced tasks, leading to a taxonomy of abstract tasks for unlabelled graphs. Our task taxonomy is organized according to the Scope of the data at play, the Action intended by the user, and the Target data under consideration. We show the descriptive power of this task abstraction by connecting to concrete examples from previous frameworks, and connect these abstractions to real-world problems. To showcase the evaluative power of the taxonomy, we perform a preliminary assessment of 6 visualizations for each task. For each combination of task and visual encoding, we consider the effort required from viewers, the likelihood of task success, and how both factors vary between small-scale and large-scale graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bobo Lian, Dandan Wang, Chenjian Wu, Minxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and compact representation of signed distance functions (SDFs) of implicit surfaces is crucial for efficient storage, computation, and downstream processing of 3D geometry. In this work, we propose a general learning method for approximating precomputed SDF fields of implicit surfaces by a relatively small number of ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs). The SDF values could be computed from various sources, including point clouds, triangle meshes, analytical expressions, pretrained neural networks, etc. Given SDF values on spatial grid points, our method approximates the SDF using as few ERBFs as possible, achieving a compact representation while preserving the geometric shape of the corresponding implicit surface. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, we introduce a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy, which adaptively incorporates regularization to enforce sparsity and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of the ERBFs. For computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure restricts computations to points near each kernel center, and CUDA-based parallelism further accelerates the optimization. Furthermore, a hierarchical refinement strategy based on SDF spatial grid points progressively incorporates coarse-to-fine samples for parameter initialization and optimization, improving convergence and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can represent SDF fields with significantly fewer parameters than existing sparse implicit representation approaches, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Lappe, Martin A. Giese</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2 model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings, we show that the [CLS] token itself leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens. Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behavior to register and [CLS] tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yapei Chang, Yekyung Kim, Michael Krumdick, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Chris Tanner, Mohit Iyyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet effective proxies for reward models during alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhilin Wang, Jiaqi Zeng, Olivier Delalleau, Hoo-Chang Shin, Felipe Soares, Alexander Bukharin, Ellie Evans, Yi Dong, Oleksii Kuchaiev</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference datasets are essential for training general-domain, instruction-following language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Each subsequent data release raises expectations for future data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0), high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000 samples. These samples span diverse real-world applications of large language models (LLMs), including tasks relating to STEM, coding and multilingual scenarios. Using HelpSteer3-Preference, we train Reward Models (RMs) that achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference can also be applied to train Generative RMs and how policy models can be aligned with RLHF using our RMs. Dataset (CC-BY-4.0): https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer3#preference Models (NVIDIA Open Model): https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/reward-models-68377c5955575f71fcc7a2a3</p>

<p>Abstract: Biodiversity research requires complete and detailed information to study ecosystem dynamics at different scales. Employing data-driven methods like Machine Learning is getting traction in ecology and more specific biodiversity, offering alternative modelling pathways. For these methods to deliver accurate results there is the need for large, curated and multimodal datasets that offer granular spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work, we introduce BioCube, a multimodal, fine-grained global dataset for ecology and biodiversity research. BioCube incorporates species observations through images, audio recordings and descriptions, environmental DNA, vegetation indices, agricultural, forest, land indicators, and high-resolution climate variables. All observations are geospatially aligned under the WGS84 geodetic system, spanning from 2000 to 2020.

<p>Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. To address this, we introduce \textsc{LEXam}, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Deploying an ensemble LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately, closely aligning with human expert assessments. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. We have open-sourced our code on https://github.com/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam and released our data on https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Jeong, Taesoo Kim, Sangdon Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The hallucination of code generation models hinders their applicability to systems requiring higher safety standards. One critical bottleneck in addressing code hallucination is the difficulty of identifying the functional correctness of generated code, due to its unnatural form. We address this core bottleneck by automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, leveraging the \emph{executable nature} of code. Accordingly, we propose \emph{selective code generator} that abstains from uncertain generations -- based on the functional correctness evaluated by generated unit tests -- to theoretically control the correctness among non-abstained answers, \ie the false discovery rate. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method along with the controllability of code hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given a large pool of unlabelled data and a smaller amount of labels, prediction-powered inference (PPI) leverages machine learning predictions to increase the statistical efficiency of confidence interval procedures based solely on labelled data, while preserving fixed-time validity. In this paper, we extend the PPI framework to the sequential setting, where labelled and unlabelled datasets grow over time. Exploiting Ville's inequality and the method of mixtures, we propose prediction-powered confidence sequence procedures that are asymptotically valid uniformly over time and naturally accommodate prior knowledge on the quality of the predictions to further boost efficiency. We carefully illustrate the design choices behind our method and demonstrate its effectiveness in real and synthetic examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soyoung Yoon, Gyuwan Kim, Gyu-Hwung Cho, Seung-won Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance. Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based reranking models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lorentz-equivariant neural networks are becoming the leading architectures for high-energy physics. Current implementations rely on specialized layers, limiting architectural choices. We introduce Lorentz Local Canonicalization (LLoCa), a general framework that renders any backbone network exactly Lorentz-equivariant. Using equivariantly predicted local reference frames, we construct LLoCa-transformers and graph networks. We adapt a recent approach for geometric message passing to the non-compact Lorentz group, allowing propagation of space-time tensorial features. Data augmentation emerges from LLoCa as a special choice of reference frame. Our models achieve competitive and state-of-the-art accuracy on relevant particle physics tasks, while being $4\times$ faster and using $10\times$ fewer FLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhang, Xinran Li, Jianing Ye, Shuang Qiu, Delin Qu, Xiu Li, Chongjie Zhang, Chenjia Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research. Codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/breez3young/DIMA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon R. Feng, David Keetae Park, Xihaier Luo, Arantxa Urdangarin, Shinjae Yoo, Brian J. Reich</p>
<p>Abstract: Fitting Gaussian Processes (GPs) provides interpretable aleatoric uncertainty quantification for estimation of spatio-temporal fields. Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Nakhleh, Robert D. Nowak</p>
<p>Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the sparsest interpolating ReLU network--i.e., the network with the fewest nonzero parameters or neurons--a goal with wide-ranging implications for efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression. Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data. This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing $\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 < p < 1$, a classical sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to recover sparse networks through training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shriram M Sathiyanarayanan, Xinyue Hao, Shihao Hou, Yang Lu, Laura Sevilla-Lara, Anurag Arnab, Shreyank N Gowda</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of the machine learning field has reliably depended on training on large datasets. While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost. This is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size of datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

<p>Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches for river discharge forecasting have improved the accuracy and efficiency in flood forecasting, enabling more reliable early warning systems for risk management. Nevertheless, existing deep learning approaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and do not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus, there is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of modeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood forecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we present RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with long-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and floods on a $0.05^\circ$ grid up to $7$ days lead time, which is of high relevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient Mamba blocks that enable the model to capture spatio-temporal relations in very large river networks and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast blocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for their inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates that RiverMamba provides reliable predictions of river discharge across various flood return periods, including extreme floods, and lead times, surpassing both AI- and physics-based models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Askari, Shivanshu Gupta, Fei Wang, Anshuman Chhabra, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance. It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reece Keller, Alyn Kirsch, Felix Pei, Xaq Pitkow, Leo Kozachkov, Aran Nayebi</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in reward-free environments, including a class of methods known as model-based intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and do not converge to an exploratory policy, thus failing to capture robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in ethological, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed after the principles of autonomous exploration in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) achieves animal-like exploration by tracking divergence between an online world model and a fixed prior learned from an ecological niche. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first autonomous embodied agent that predicts brain data entirely from self-supervised optimization of an intrinsic goal -- without any behavioral or neural training data -- demonstrating that 3M-Progress agents capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously behaving larval zebrafish, thereby providing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saibo Geng, Nathan Ranchin, Yunzhen yao, Maxime Peyrard, Chris Wendler, Michael Gastpar, Robert West</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized on general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a novel method for achieving context-adaptive tokenization in LLMs at inference time. Leveraging an online data compression algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), zip2zip dynamically expands its active vocabulary at inference time by continuously replacing fragmented token sequences with more compact hypertokens, which it can immediately output during generation. In doing so, the model refines its internal tokenization scheme to match the token distribution of the current context, reducing redundancy and improving representational efficiency. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression that incrementally merges co-occurring tokens into reusable hypertokens on the fly; (2) a dynamic embedding (and unembedding) layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a variant of autoregressive language modeling that pretrains the model to handle hypertokenized, compressed text sequences as inputs and outputs. We show that an existing LLM can be uptrained for zip2zip in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting LLM performs test-time adaptation, learning to use hypertokens in unseen contexts and reducing input and output tokens by 15-40%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyuyoung Kim, Hyunjun Jeon, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text introduces emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external models at inference time. SEAL leverages adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are then used to distill anonymization and critique capabilities into SLMs through supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn both to anonymize text and to evaluate their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy protection. These results highlight the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework for training SLMs as efficient anonymizers.</p>

Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability. Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guiqiu Liao, Matjaz Jogan, Eric Eaton, Daniel A. Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Zhang, Kevin D. Ashley</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents (factor analyst and argument polisher) in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate reflective multi-agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate that the reflective multi-agent approach excels at successful abstention by preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded, improves hallucination accuracy by reducing fabricated and misattributed factors and enhances factor utilization recall by better using the provided case facts. These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disaggregated evaluation across subgroups is critical for assessing the fairness of machine learning models, but its uncritical use can mislead practitioners. We show that equal performance across subgroups is an unreliable measure of fairness when data are representative of the relevant populations but reflective of real-world disparities. Furthermore, when data are not representative due to selection bias, both disaggregated evaluation and alternative approaches based on conditional independence testing may be invalid without explicit assumptions regarding the bias mechanism. We use causal graphical models to characterize fairness properties and metric stability across subgroups under different data generating processes. Our framework suggests complementing disaggregated evaluations with explicit causal assumptions and analysis to control for confounding and distribution shift, including conditional independence testing and weighted performance estimation. These findings have broad implications for how practitioners design and interpret model assessments given the ubiquity of disaggregated evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuga Hikida, Ayush Bharti, Niall Jeffrey, Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Briol</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evan Markou, Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, Stephen Gould</p>
<p>Abstract: Many high-dimensional optimisation problems exhibit rich geometric structures in their set of minimisers, often forming smooth manifolds due to over-parametrisation or symmetries. When this structure is known, at least locally, it can be exploited through reduction mappings that reparametrise part of the parameter space to lie on the solution manifold. These reductions naturally arise from inner optimisation problems and effectively remove redundant directions, yielding a lower-dimensional objective. In this work, we introduce a general framework to understand how such reductions influence the optimisation landscape. We show that well-designed reduction mappings improve curvature properties of the objective, leading to better-conditioned problems and theoretically faster convergence for gradient-based methods. Our analysis unifies a range of scenarios where structural information at optimality is leveraged to accelerate convergence, offering a principled explanation for the empirical gains observed in such optimisation algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marek Kadl\v{c}\'ik, Michal \v{S}tef\'anik, Timothee Mickus, Michal Spiegel, Josef Kucha\v{r}</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models' representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' precision, judged by our probe's accuracy, explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern our probes discover can mitigate these errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhen Zhang, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mojtaba Nafez, Amirhossein Koochakian, Arad Maleki, Jafar Habibi, Mohammad Hossein Rohban</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and $68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Rahimi, Sebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation is increasingly used in machine learning for training and data augmentation. Yet, current strategies often rely on external foundation models or datasets, whose usage is restricted in many scenarios due to policy or legal constraints. We propose ScoreMix, a self-contained synthetic generation method to produce hard synthetic samples for recognition tasks by leveraging the score compositionality of diffusion models. The approach mixes class-conditioned scores along reverse diffusion trajectories, yielding domain-specific data augmentation without external resources. We systematically study class-selection strategies and find that mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space yields larger gains, providing up to 3% additional average improvement, compared to selection based on proximity. Interestingly, we observe that condition and embedding spaces are largely uncorrelated under standard alignment metrics, and the generator's condition space has a negligible effect on downstream performance. Across 8 public face recognition benchmarks, ScoreMix improves accuracy by up to 7 percentage points, without hyperparameter search, highlighting both robustness and practicality. Our method provides a simple yet effective way to maximize discriminator performance using only the available dataset, without reliance on third-party resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Duan, Hamza Tahir Chaudhry, Misha B. Ahrens, Christopher D Harvey, Matthew G Perich, Karl Deisseroth, Kanaka Rajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsoo Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Simyung Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time-quickly exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii) keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four open-source MLLMs and four long-video and streaming-video benchmarks, InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy-even in multi-turn dialogues. By dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge, InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Leon, S. Rasoul Etesami</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP). In each round, the seller determines an allocation and sets a payment for each bidder, while each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy without episodic resets. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic counterpart that preserves the desired properties: efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality. We then focus on the online setting and develop a reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned mechanism approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongwon Lee, Lizhen Lin, Jaewoo Park, Seonghyun Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions, including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.</p>

In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkai Deng, Jinyu Hou, Zhiting Hu, Eric Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents built on foundation models hold enormous promise. Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release ReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source research demo.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mauro Belgiovine, Chris Dick, Kaushik Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i) Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two DTs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Gonzalez, Leo Kozachkov, David M. Zoltowski, Kenneth L. Clarkson, Scott W. Linderman</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Li, Weiwei Yi, Jiahong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination in generative AI is often treated as a technical failure to produce factually correct output. Yet this framing underrepresents the broader significance of hallucinated content in language models, which may appear fluent, persuasive, and contextually appropriate while conveying distortions that escape conventional accuracy checks. This paper critically examines how regulatory and evaluation frameworks have inherited a narrow view of hallucination, one that prioritises surface verifiability over deeper questions of meaning, influence, and impact. We propose a layered approach to understanding hallucination risks, encompassing epistemic instability, user misdirection, and social-scale effects. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources and examining instruments such as the EU AI Act and the GDPR, we show that current governance models struggle to address hallucination when it manifests as ambiguity, bias reinforcement, or normative convergence. Rather than improving factual precision alone, we argue for regulatory responses that account for languages generative nature, the asymmetries between system and user, and the shifting boundaries between information, persuasion, and harm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeongbin Seo, Dongha Lee, Jaehyung Kim, Jinyoung Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks (sacrificing bidirectionality), but we find that this also leads to time-interval expansion problem, sacrificing the speed. Therefore, semi-AR eliminates the main advantages of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Sharifi, Danial Ahmadzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity resolution plays a significant role in enterprise systems where data integrity must be rigorously maintained. Traditional methods often struggle with handling noisy data or semantic understanding, while modern methods suffer from computational costs or the excessive need for parallel computation. In this study, we introduce a scalable hybrid framework, which is designed to address several important problems, including scalability, noise robustness, and reliable results. We utilized a pre-trained language model to encode each structured data into corresponding semantic embedding vectors. Subsequently, after retrieving a semantically relevant subset of candidates, we apply a syntactic verification stage using fuzzy string matching techniques to refine classification on the unlabeled data. This approach was applied to a real-world entity resolution task, which exposed a linkage between a central user management database and numerous shared hosting server records. Compared to other methods, this approach exhibits an outstanding performance in terms of both processing time and robustness, making it a reliable solution for a server-side product. Crucially, this efficiency does not compromise results, as the system maintains a high retrieval recall of approximately 0.97. The scalability of the framework makes it deployable on standard CPU-based infrastructure, offering a practical and effective solution for enterprise-level data integrity auditing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wandi Xu, Wei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i) an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of biomanufacturing processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Schapiro, Sumuk Shashidhar, Alexi Gladstone, Jonah Black, Royce Moon, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Lav R. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Despite its similarities to compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Curie, Paulo da Costa</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Zhou, Jin Zhu, Pingfan Su, Kai Ye, Ying Yang, Shakeel A O B Gavioli-Akilagun, Chengchun Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 37\%.

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored, despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Shikuri, Hironori Fujisawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Survival analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the time until an event occurs. Although it is applied across a wide range of fields, adjusting for reporting delays under practical constraints remains a significant challenge in the insurance industry. Such delays render event occurrences unobservable when their reports are subject to right censoring. This issue becomes particularly critical when estimating hazard rates for newly enrolled cohorts with limited follow-up due to administrative censoring. Our study addresses this challenge by jointly modeling the parametric hazard functions of event occurrences and report timings. The joint probability distribution is marginalized over the latent event occurrence status. We construct an estimator for the proposed survival model and establish its asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to compute its estimates. Using these findings, we propose a two-stage estimation procedure based on a parametric proportional hazards model to evaluate observations subject to administrative censoring. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the timeliness of risk evaluation for newly enrolled cohorts.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the Mean-Field Actor-Critic (MFAC) flow, a continuous-time learning dynamics for solving mean-field games (MFGs), combining techniques from reinforcement learning and optimal transport. The MFAC framework jointly evolves the control (actor), value function (critic), and distribution components through coupled gradient-based updates governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). A central innovation is the Optimal Transport Geodesic Picard (OTGP) flow, which drives the distribution toward equilibrium along Wasserstein-2 geodesics. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis using Lyapunov functionals and establish global exponential convergence of the MFAC flow under a suitable timescale. Our results highlight the algorithmic interplay among actor, critic, and distribution components. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MFAC framework in computing MFG equilibria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Yu, Julian Jordan, Julian Schmidt, Silvan Lindner, Alessandro Canevaro, Wilhelm Stork</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions, we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance, requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuquan Xue, Guanxing Lu, Zhenyu Wu, Chuanrui Zhang, Bofang Jia, Zhengyi Gu, Yansong Tang, Ziwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning, memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 57%) concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban air pollution poses significant risks to public health, environmental sustainability, and policy planning. Effective air quality management requires predictive tools that can integrate diverse datasets and communicate complex spatial and temporal pollution patterns. There is a gap in interactive tools with seamless integration of forecasting and visualization of spatial distributions of air pollutant concentrations. We present CityAQVis, an interactive machine learning ML sandbox tool designed to predict and visualize pollutant concentrations at the ground level using multi-source data, which includes satellite observations, meteorological parameters, population density, elevation, and nighttime lights. While traditional air quality visualization tools often lack forecasting capabilities, CityAQVis enables users to build and compare predictive models, visualizing the model outputs and offering insights into pollution dynamics at the ground level. The pilot implementation of the tool is tested through case studies predicting nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in metropolitan regions, highlighting its adaptability to various pollutants. Through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), the user can perform comparative visualizations of the spatial distribution of surface-level pollutant concentration in two different urban scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of ML-driven visual analytics to improve situational awareness and support data-driven decision-making in air quality management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongji Wu, Xueshen Liu, Haizhong Zheng, Juncheng Gu, Beidi Chen, Z. Morley Mao, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). RL workflows involve interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently harvested for rollout.
  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster, (2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Norelli, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Zhang, Xinyue Ma, Arpita Chowdhury, Elizabeth G. Campolongo, Matthew J. Thompson, Net Zhang, Samuel Stevens, Hilmar Lapp, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Yu Su, Wei-Lun Chao, Jianyang Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BioCAP (i.e., BioCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Darius Konrad, Nikolas Kuschnig</p>
<p>Abstract: Small subsets of data with disproportionate influence on model outcomes can have dramatic impacts on conclusions, with a few data points sometimes overturning key findings. While recent work has developed methods to identify these most influential sets, no formal theory exists to determine when their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence, replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine learning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutian He, Philip N. Garner</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks. To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly, we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.</p>
