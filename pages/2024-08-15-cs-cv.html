<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean J. Liu, Nupur Kumari, Ariel Shamir, Jun-Yan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models are powerful tools for image creation. However, the generation process is akin to a dice roll and makes it difficult to achieve a single image that captures everything a user wants. In this paper, we propose a framework for creating the desired image by compositing it from various parts of generated images, in essence forming a Generative Photomontage. Given a stack of images generated by ControlNet using the same input condition and different seeds, we let users select desired parts from the generated results using a brush stroke interface. We introduce a novel technique that takes in the user's brush strokes, segments the generated images using a graph-based optimization in diffusion feature space, and then composites the segmented regions via a new feature-space blending method. Our method faithfully preserves the user-selected regions while compositing them harmoniously. We demonstrate that our flexible framework can be used for many applications, including generating new appearance combinations, fixing incorrect shapes and artifacts, and improving prompt alignment. We show compelling results for each application and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing image blending methods and various baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07146">Vision Language Model for Interpretable and Fine-grained Detection of Safety Compliance in Diverse Workplaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiling Chen, Hanning Chen, Mohsen Imani, Ruimin Chen, Farhad Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Workplace accidents due to personal protective equipment (PPE) non-compliance raise serious safety concerns and lead to legal liabilities, financial penalties, and reputational damage. While object detection models have shown the capability to address this issue by identifying safety items, most existing models, such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and SSD, are limited in verifying the fine-grained attributes of PPE across diverse workplace scenarios. Vision language models (VLMs) are gaining traction for detection tasks by leveraging the synergy between visual and textual information, offering a promising solution to traditional object detection limitations in PPE recognition. Nonetheless, VLMs face challenges in consistently verifying PPE attributes due to the complexity and variability of workplace environments, requiring them to interpret context-specific language and visual cues simultaneously. We introduce Clip2Safety, an interpretable detection framework for diverse workplace safety compliance, which comprises four main modules: scene recognition, the visual prompt, safety items detection, and fine-grained verification. The scene recognition identifies the current scenario to determine the necessary safety gear. The visual prompt formulates the specific visual prompts needed for the detection process. The safety items detection identifies whether the required safety gear is being worn according to the specified scenario. Lastly, the fine-grained verification assesses whether the worn safety equipment meets the fine-grained attribute requirements. We conduct real-world case studies across six different scenarios. The results show that Clip2Safety not only demonstrates an accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art question-answering based VLMs but also achieves inference times two hundred times faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sruthi Sudhakar, Ruoshi Liu, Basile Van Hoorick, Carl Vondrick, Richard Zemel</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans naturally build mental models of object interactions and dynamics, allowing them to imagine how their surroundings will change if they take a certain action. While generative models today have shown impressive results on generating/editing images unconditionally or conditioned on text, current methods do not provide the ability to perform object manipulation conditioned on actions, an important tool for world modeling and action planning. Therefore, we propose to learn an action-conditional generative models by learning from unlabeled videos of human hands interacting with objects. The vast quantity of such data on the internet allows for efficient scaling which can enable high-performing action-conditional models. Given an image, and the shape/location of a desired hand interaction, CosHand, synthesizes an image of a future after the interaction has occurred. Experiments show that the resulting model can predict the effects of hand-object interactions well, with strong generalization particularly to translation, stretching, and squeezing interactions of unseen objects in unseen environments. Further, CosHand can be sampled many times to predict multiple possible effects, modeling the uncertainty of forces in the interaction/environment. Finally, method generalizes to different embodiments, including non-human hands, i.e. robot hands, suggesting that generative video models can be powerful models for robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Guan, Ruixin Liu, Zejian Yuan, Ao Liu, Kun Tang, Tong Zhou, Erlong Li, Chao Zheng, Shuqi Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: As one of the basic while vital technologies for HD map construction, 3D lane detection is still an open problem due to varying visual conditions, complex typologies, and strict demands for precision. In this paper, an end-to-end flexible and hierarchical lane detector is proposed to precisely predict 3D lane lines from point clouds. Specifically, we design a hierarchical network predicting flexible representations of lane shapes at different levels, simultaneously collecting global instance semantics and avoiding local errors. In the global scope, we propose to regress parametric curves w.r.t adaptive axes that help to make more robust predictions towards complex scenes, while in the local vision the structure of lane segment is detected in each of the dynamic anchor cells sampled along the global predicted curves. Moreover, corresponding global and local shape matching losses and anchor cell generation strategies are designed. Experiments on two datasets show that we overwhelm current top methods under high precision standards, and full ablation studies also verify each part of our method.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07196">SeLoRA: Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation of Latent Diffusion Model for Medical Image Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Mao, Hongwei Li, Wei Pang, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Guang Yang, Chengjia Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The persistent challenge of medical image synthesis posed by the scarcity of annotated data and the need to synthesize `missing modalities' for multi-modal analysis, underscored the imperative development of effective synthesis methods. Recently, the combination of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with latent diffusion models (LDMs) has emerged as a viable approach for efficiently adapting pre-trained large language models, in the medical field. However, the direct application of LoRA assumes uniform ranking across all linear layers, overlooking the significance of different weight matrices, and leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Prior works on LoRA prioritize the reduction of trainable parameters, and there exists an opportunity to further tailor this adaptation process to the intricate demands of medical image synthesis. In response, we present SeLoRA, a Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation Module, that dynamically expands its ranking across layers during training, strategically placing additional ranks on crucial layers, to allow the model to elevate synthesis quality where it matters most. The proposed method not only enables LDMs to fine-tune on medical data efficiently but also empowers the model to achieve improved image quality with minimal ranking. The code of our SeLoRA method is publicly available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SeLoRA-980D .</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07220">Handwritten Code Recognition for Pen-and-Paper CS Education</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Sazzad Islam, Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Christopher D. Manning, Chris Piech</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching Computer Science (CS) by having students write programs by hand on paper has key pedagogical advantages: It allows focused learning and requires careful thinking compared to the use of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) with intelligent support tools or "just trying things out". The familiar environment of pens and paper also lessens the cognitive load of students with no prior experience with computers, for whom the mere basic usage of computers can be intimidating. Finally, this teaching approach opens learning opportunities to students with limited access to computers.
  However, a key obstacle is the current lack of teaching methods and support software for working with and running handwritten programs. Optical character recognition (OCR) of handwritten code is challenging: Minor OCR errors, perhaps due to varied handwriting styles, easily make code not run, and recognizing indentation is crucial for languages like Python but is difficult to do due to inconsistent horizontal spacing in handwriting. Our approach integrates two innovative methods. The first combines OCR with an indentation recognition module and a language model designed for post-OCR error correction without introducing hallucinations. This method, to our knowledge, surpasses all existing systems in handwritten code recognition. It reduces error from 30\% in the state of the art to 5\% with minimal hallucination of logical fixes to student programs. The second method leverages a multimodal language model to recognize handwritten programs in an end-to-end fashion. We hope this contribution can stimulate further pedagogical research and contribute to the goal of making CS education universally accessible. We release a dataset of handwritten programs and code to support future research at https://github.com/mdoumbouya/codeocr</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Kage, Jay C. Rothenberger, Pavlos Andreadis, Dimitrios I. Diochnos</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural models have achieved state of the art performance on a wide range of problems in computer science, especially in computer vision. However, deep neural networks often require large datasets of labeled samples to generalize effectively, and an important area of active research is semi-supervised learning, which attempts to instead utilize large quantities of (easily acquired) unlabeled samples. One family of methods in this space is pseudo-labeling, a class of algorithms that use model outputs to assign labels to unlabeled samples which are then used as labeled samples during training. Such assigned labels, called pseudo-labels, are most commonly associated with the field of semi-supervised learning. In this work we explore a broader interpretation of pseudo-labels within both self-supervised and unsupervised methods. By drawing the connection between these areas we identify new directions when advancements in one area would likely benefit others, such as curriculum learning and self-supervised regularization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07239">Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Perception in Adverse Weather through Image Augmentation during Semantic Segmentation Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ethan Kou, Noah Curran</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust perception is crucial in autonomous vehicle navigation and localization. Visual processing tasks, like semantic segmentation, should work in varying weather conditions and during different times of day. Semantic segmentation is where each pixel is assigned a class, which is useful for locating overall features (1). Training a segmentation model requires large amounts of data, and the labeling process for segmentation data is especially tedious. Additionally, many large datasets include only images taken in clear weather. This is a problem because training a model exclusively on clear weather data hinders performance in adverse weather conditions like fog or rain. We hypothesize that given a dataset of only clear days images, applying image augmentation (such as random rain, fog, and brightness) during training allows for domain adaptation to diverse weather conditions. We used CARLA, a 3D realistic autonomous vehicle simulator, to collect 1200 images in clear weather composed of 29 classes from 10 different towns (2). We also collected 1200 images of random weather effects. We trained encoder-decoder UNet models to perform semantic segmentation. Applying augmentations significantly improved segmentation under weathered night conditions (p < 0.001). However, models trained on weather data have significantly lower losses than those trained on augmented data in all conditions except for clear days. This shows there is room for improvement in the domain adaptation approach. Future work should test more types of augmentations and also use real-life images instead of CARLA. Ideally, the augmented model meets or exceeds the performance of the weather model.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07243">Leveraging Perceptual Scores for Dataset Pruning in Computer Vision Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Raghavendra Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a score of an image to use for coreset selection in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07244">Sign language recognition based on deep learning and low-cost handcrafted descriptors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alvaro Leandro Cavalcante Carneiro, Denis Henrique Pinheiro Salvadeo, Lucas de Brito Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning techniques have been used to develop sign language recognition systems, potentially serving as a communication tool for millions of hearing-impaired individuals worldwide. However, there are inherent challenges in creating such systems. Firstly, it is important to consider as many linguistic parameters as possible in gesture execution to avoid ambiguity between words. Moreover, to facilitate the real-world adoption of the created solution, it is essential to ensure that the chosen technology is realistic, avoiding expensive, intrusive, or low-mobility sensors, as well as very complex deep learning architectures that impose high computational requirements. Based on this, our work aims to propose an efficient sign language recognition system that utilizes low-cost sensors and techniques. To this end, an object detection model was trained specifically for detecting the interpreter's face and hands, ensuring focus on the most relevant regions of the image and generating inputs with higher semantic value for the classifier. Additionally, we introduced a novel approach to obtain features representing hand location and movement by leveraging spatial information derived from centroid positions of bounding boxes, thereby enhancing sign discrimination. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our handcrafted features, increasing accuracy by 7.96% on the AUTSL dataset, while adding fewer than 700 thousand parameters and incurring less than 10 milliseconds of additional inference time. These findings highlight the potential of our technique to strike a favorable balance between computational cost and accuracy, making it a promising approach for practical sign language recognition applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07249">GQE: Generalized Query Expansion for Enhanced Text-Video Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechen Bai, Tianjun Xiao, Tong He, Pichao Wang, Zheng Zhang, Thomas Brox, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly expanding domain of web video content, the task of text-video retrieval has become increasingly critical, bridging the semantic gap between textual queries and video data. This paper introduces a novel data-centric approach, Generalized Query Expansion (GQE), to address the inherent information imbalance between text and video, enhancing the effectiveness of text-video retrieval systems. Unlike traditional model-centric methods that focus on designing intricate cross-modal interaction mechanisms, GQE aims to expand the text queries associated with videos both during training and testing phases. By adaptively segmenting videos into short clips and employing zero-shot captioning, GQE enriches the training dataset with comprehensive scene descriptions, effectively bridging the data imbalance gap. Furthermore, during retrieval, GQE utilizes Large Language Models (LLM) to generate a diverse set of queries and a query selection module to filter these queries based on relevance and diversity, thus optimizing retrieval performance while reducing computational overhead. Our contributions include a detailed examination of the information imbalance challenge, a novel approach to query expansion in video-text datasets, and the introduction of a query selection strategy that enhances retrieval accuracy without increasing computational costs. GQE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, and VATEX, demonstrating the effectiveness of addressing text-video retrieval from a data-centric perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Kang, Fei Yang, Kai Wang, Mohamed Ali Souibgui, Lluis Gomez, Alicia Forn\'es, Ernest Valveny, Dimosthenis Karatzas</p>
<p>Abstract: Fonts are integral to creative endeavors, design processes, and artistic productions. The appropriate selection of a font can significantly enhance artwork and endow advertisements with a higher level of expressivity. Despite the availability of numerous diverse font designs online, traditional retrieval-based methods for font selection are increasingly being supplanted by generation-based approaches. These newer methods offer enhanced flexibility, catering to specific user preferences and capturing unique stylistic impressions. However, current impression font techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitate the utilization of multiple auxiliary losses to provide guidance during generation. Furthermore, these methods commonly employ weighted summation for the fusion of impression-related keywords. This leads to generic vectors with the addition of more impression keywords, ultimately lacking in detail generation capacity. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based method, termed \ourmethod, to generate fonts that vividly embody specific impressions, utilizing an input consisting of a single letter and a set of descriptive impression keywords. The core innovation of \ourmethod lies in the development of dual cross-attention modules, which process the characteristics of the letters and impression keywords independently but synergistically, ensuring effective integration of both types of information. Our experimental results, conducted on the MyFonts dataset, affirm that this method is capable of producing realistic, vibrant, and high-fidelity fonts that are closely aligned with user specifications. This confirms the potential of our approach to revolutionize font generation by accommodating a broad spectrum of user-driven design requirements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruofeng Wei, Bin Li, Kai Chen, Yiyao Ma, Yunhui Liu, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Scale-aware monocular depth estimation poses a significant challenge in computer-aided endoscopic navigation. However, existing depth estimation methods that do not consider the geometric priors struggle to learn the absolute scale from training with monocular endoscopic sequences. Additionally, conventional methods face difficulties in accurately estimating details on tissue and instruments boundaries. In this paper, we tackle these problems by proposing a novel enhanced scale-aware framework that only uses monocular images with geometric modeling for depth estimation. Specifically, we first propose a multi-resolution depth fusion strategy to enhance the quality of monocular depth estimation. To recover the precise scale between relative depth and real-world values, we further calculate the 3D poses of instruments in the endoscopic scenes by algebraic geometry based on the image-only geometric primitives (i.e., boundaries and tip of instruments). Afterwards, the 3D poses of surgical instruments enable the scale recovery of relative depth maps. By coupling scale factors and relative depth estimation, the scale-aware depth of the monocular endoscopic scenes can be estimated. We evaluate the pipeline on in-house endoscopic surgery videos and simulated data. The results demonstrate that our method can learn the absolute scale with geometric modeling and accurately estimate scale-aware depth for monocular scenes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines the challenges and advancements in recognizing seals within their natural habitats using conventional photography, underscored by the emergence of machine learning technologies. We used the leopard seal, \emph{Hydrurga leptonyx}, a key species within Antarctic ecosystems, to review the different available methods found. As apex predators, Leopard seals are characterized by their significant ecological role and elusive nature so studying them is crucial to understand the health of their ecosystem. Traditional methods of monitoring seal species are often constrained by the labor-intensive and time-consuming processes required for collecting data, compounded by the limited insights these methods provide. The advent of machine learning, particularly through the application of vision transformers, heralds a new era of efficiency and precision in species monitoring. By leveraging state-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, and recognition within digital imaging, this paper presents a synthesis of the current landscape, highlighting both the cutting-edge methodologies and the predominant challenges faced in accurately identifying seals through photographic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires systems to provide accurate answers to questions based on image content. Current VQA models struggle with complex questions due to limitations in capturing and integrating multimodal information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Rank VQA model, which leverages a ranking-inspired hybrid training strategy to enhance VQA performance. The Rank VQA model integrates high-quality visual features extracted using the Faster R-CNN model and rich semantic text features obtained from a pre-trained BERT model. These features are fused through a sophisticated multimodal fusion technique employing multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, a ranking learning module is incorporated to optimize the relative ranking of answers, thus improving answer accuracy. The hybrid training strategy combines classification and ranking losses, enhancing the model's generalization ability and robustness across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rank VQA model. Our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on standard VQA datasets, including VQA v2.0 and COCO-QA, in terms of both accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The superior performance of Rank VQA is evident in its ability to handle complex questions that require understanding nuanced details and making sophisticated inferences from the image and text. This work highlights the effectiveness of a ranking-based hybrid training strategy in improving VQA performance and lays the groundwork for further research in multimodal learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Xie, Fu Feng, Jing Wang, Xin Geng, Yong Rui</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained models have become the preferred backbone due to the expansion of model parameters, with techniques like Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFTs) typically fixing the parameters of these models. However, pre-trained models may not always be optimal, especially when there are discrepancies between training tasks and target tasks, potentially resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we introduce \textbf{KIND}, which performs \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{IN}tegration and \textbf{D}iversion in diffusion models. KIND first integrates knowledge by decomposing parameter matrices of models using $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V$ matrices, formally inspired by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then it explicitly partitions the components of these matrices into \textbf{learngenes} and \textbf{tailors} to condense common and class-specific knowledge, respectively, through a class gate. In this way, KIND redefines traditional pre-training methods by adjusting training objectives from maximizing model performance on current tasks to condensing transferable common knowledge, leveraging the \textit{Learngene} framework. We conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K and compare KIND with PEFT and other learngene methods. Results indicate that KIND achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other PEFT and learngene methods. Specifically, the images generated by KIND achieves more than 6.54 and 1.07 decrease in FID and sFID on DiT-L/2, utilizing only 45.4M trainable parameters and saving at least 35.4G FLOPs in computational cost.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07341">Robust Semi-supervised Multimodal Medical Image Segmentation via Cross Modality Collaboration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaogen Zhon, Yiyou Sun, Min Deng, Winnie Chiu Wing Chu, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning leverages complementary information derived from different modalities, thereby enhancing performance in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing multimodal learning methods heavily rely on extensive well-annotated data from various modalities to achieve accurate segmentation performance. This dependence often poses a challenge in clinical settings due to limited availability of such data. Moreover, the inherent anatomical misalignment between different imaging modalities further complicates the endeavor to enhance segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal segmentation framework that is robust to scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework employs a novel cross modality collaboration strategy to distill modality-independent knowledge, which is inherently associated with each modality, and integrates this information into a unified fusion layer for feature amalgamation. With a channel-wise semantic consistency loss, our framework ensures alignment of modality-independent information from a feature-wise perspective across modalities, thereby fortifying it against misalignments in multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, our framework effectively integrates contrastive consistent learning to regulate anatomical structures, facilitating anatomical-wise prediction alignment on unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other multimodal methods across three tasks: cardiac, abdominal multi-organ, and thyroid-associated orbitopathy segmentations. It also demonstrates outstanding robustness in scenarios involving scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task. The code and weights of pre-trained source models will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Guo, Rujie Liu, Narishige Abe</p>
<p>Abstract: Data association is an essential part in the tracking-by-detection based Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). Most trackers focus on how to design a better data association strategy to improve the tracking performance. The rule-based handcrafted association methods are simple and highly efficient but lack generalization capability to deal with complex scenes. While the learnt association methods can learn high-order contextual information to deal with various complex scenes, but they have the limitations of higher complexity and cost. To address these limitations, we propose a Robust Two-stage Association Tracker, named RTAT. The first-stage association is performed between tracklets and detections to generate tracklets with high purity, and the second-stage association is performed between tracklets to form complete trajectories. For the first-stage association, we use a simple data association strategy to generate tracklets with high purity by setting a low threshold for the matching cost in the assignment process. We conduct the tracklet association in the second-stage based on the framework of message-passing GNN. Our method models the tracklet association as a series of edge classification problem in hierarchical graphs, which can recursively merge short tracklets into longer ones. Our tracker RTAT ranks first on the test set of MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks in most of the main MOT metrics: HOTA, IDF1, and AssA. We achieve 67.2 HOTA, 84.7 IDF1, and 69.7 AssA on MOT17, and 66.2 HOTA, 82.5 IDF1, and 68.1 AssA on MOT20.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Vora, Sudipan Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is an important topic in computer vision with many relevant application in Earth observation. While supervised methods exist, the constraints of limited annotated data has encouraged development of unsupervised approaches. However, existing unsupervised methods resemble clustering and cannot be directly mapped to explicit target classes. In this paper, we deal with single shot semantic segmentation, where one example for the target class is provided, which is used to segment the target class from query/test images. Our approach exploits recently popular Segment Anything (SAM), a promptable foundation model. We specifically design several techniques to automatically generate prompts from the only example/key image in such a way that the segmentation is successfully achieved on a stitch or concatenation of the example/key and query/test images. Proposed technique does not involve any training phase and just requires one example image to grasp the concept. Furthermore, no text-based prompt is required for the proposed method. We evaluated the proposed techniques on building and car classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjee Lee, Youngsik Yun, Jeongmin Bae, Seoha Kim, Youngjung Uh</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the 3D semantics of a scene is a fundamental problem for various scenarios such as embodied agents. While NeRFs and 3DGS excel at novel-view synthesis, previous methods for understanding their semantics have been limited to incomplete 3D understanding: their segmentation results are 2D masks and their supervision is anchored at 2D pixels. This paper revisits the problem set to pursue a better 3D understanding of a scene modeled by NeRFs and 3DGS as follows. 1) We directly supervise the 3D points to train the language embedding field. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without relying on multi-scale language embeddings. 2) We transfer the pre-trained language field to 3DGS, achieving the first real-time rendering speed without sacrificing training time or accuracy. 3) We introduce a 3D querying and evaluation protocol for assessing the reconstructed geometry and semantics together.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liting Jiang, Yuming Xiang, Feng Wang, Hongjian You</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo matching in remote sensing has recently garnered increased attention, primarily focusing on supervised learning. However, datasets with ground truth generated by expensive airbone Lidar exhibit limited quantity and diversity, constraining the effectiveness of supervised networks. In contrast, unsupervised learning methods can leverage the increasing availability of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images, offering considerable potential in the realm of stereo matching. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a novel unsupervised stereo matching network for VHR remote sensing images. A light-weight module to bridge confidence with predicted error is introduced to refine the core model. Robust unsupervised losses are formulated to enhance network convergence. The experimental results on US3D and WHU-Stereo datasets demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior accuracy compared to other unsupervised networks and exhibits better generalization capabilities than supervised models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Yang, Sicheng Zhao, Yanhao Zhang, Haoxiang Chen, Hui Chen, Wenbo Tang, Haonan Lu, Pengfei Xu, Zhenyu Yang, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics, and embodied intelligence have necessitated 3D perception algorithms. However, current 3D perception methods, particularly small models, struggle with processing logical reasoning, question-answering, and handling open scenario categories. On the other hand, generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak spatial and local object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations. To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations. We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for a pre-trained MLLM and develop LLMI3D, a powerful 3D perception MLLM. Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07430">UAHOI: Uncertainty-aware Robust Interaction Learning for HOI Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mu Chen, Minghan Chen, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, addressing the challenge of identifying and understanding the interactions between humans and objects within a given image or video frame. Spearheaded by Detection Transformer (DETR), recent developments lead to significant improvements by replacing traditional region proposals by a set of learnable queries. However, despite the powerful representation capabilities provided by Transformers, existing Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection methods still yield low confidence levels when dealing with complex interactions and are prone to overlooking interactive actions. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach \textsc{UAHOI}, Uncertainty-aware Robust Human-Object Interaction Learning that explicitly estimates prediction uncertainty during the training process to refine both detection and interaction predictions. Our model not only predicts the HOI triplets but also quantifies the uncertainty of these predictions. Specifically, we model this uncertainty through the variance of predictions and incorporate it into the optimization objective, allowing the model to adaptively adjust its confidence threshold based on prediction variance. This integration helps in mitigating the adverse effects of incorrect or ambiguous predictions that are common in traditional methods without any hand-designed components, serving as an automatic confidence threshold. Our method is flexible to existing HOI detection methods and demonstrates improved accuracy. We evaluate \textsc{UAHOI} on two standard benchmarks in the field: V-COCO and HICO-DET, which represent challenging scenarios for HOI detection. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that \textsc{UAHOI} achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of HOI detection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07433">MagicFace: Training-free Universal-Style Human Image Customized Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing human image personalized generation methods often require tedious training: either fine-tuning with a few images or retraining on large-scale datasets. In such cases, these methods are prone to overfitting and encounter difficulties when personalizing individuals of diverse styles. Moreover, these training-based approaches also struggle with multi-concept human image customizing. To this end, we propose MagicFace, the first method for universal-style human image personalized synthesis that enables single/multi-concept customization for humans of any style in a training-free manner. MagicFace introduces a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involving two sequential stages: semantic scene construction and concept feature injection. This is achieved by our Reference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) and Region-grouped Blend Attention (RBA) mechanisms. Specifically, in the first stage, RSA enables the latent image to query features from reference concepts simultaneously, extracting the coarse-grained overall semantic understanding to facilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In the second stage, we employ an attention-based semantic segmentation method to pinpoint the generated regions of all concepts in the latent image at each step. Following this, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, with each group querying fine-grained features from its reference concept, which ensures precise attribute alignment and feature injection. Throughout the two-stage process, a weight mask strategy is employed to ensure the model focuses more on the reference concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority in both human-centric subject-to-image synthesis and multi-concept human image customization. Our approach also can be applied to texture transformation, further enhancing its versatility and applicability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07440">BAPLe: Backdoor Attacks on Medical Foundational Models using Prompt Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Asif Hanif, Fahad Shamshad, Muhammad Awais, Muzammal Naseer, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Karthik Nandakumar, Salman Khan, Rao Muhammad Anwer</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical foundation models are gaining prominence in the medical community for their ability to derive general representations from extensive collections of medical image-text pairs. Recent research indicates that these models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, which allow them to classify clean images accurately but fail when specific triggers are introduced. However, traditional backdoor attacks necessitate a considerable amount of additional data to maliciously pre-train a model. This requirement is often impractical in medical imaging applications due to the usual scarcity of data. Inspired by the latest developments in learnable prompts, this work introduces a method to embed a backdoor into the medical foundation model during the prompt learning phase. By incorporating learnable prompts within the text encoder and introducing imperceptible learnable noise trigger to the input images, we exploit the full capabilities of the medical foundation models (Med-FM). Our method, BAPLe, requires only a minimal subset of data to adjust the noise trigger and the text prompts for downstream tasks, enabling the creation of an effective backdoor attack. Through extensive experiments with four medical foundation models, each pre-trained on different modalities and evaluated across six downstream datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. BAPLe achieves a high backdoor success rate across all models and datasets, outperforming the baseline backdoor attack methods. Our work highlights the vulnerability of Med-FMs towards backdoor attacks and strives to promote the safe adoption of Med-FMs before their deployment in real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal networks have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over their unimodal counterparts. Existing multimodal networks are designed in a multi-branch fashion that, due to the reliance on fusion strategies, exhibit deteriorated performance if one or more modalities are missing. In this work, we propose a modality invariant multimodal learning method, which is less susceptible to the impact of missing modalities. It consists of a single-branch network sharing weights across multiple modalities to learn inter-modality representations to maximize performance as well as robustness to missing modalities. Extensive experiments are performed on four challenging datasets including textual-visual (UPMC Food-101, Hateful Memes, Ferramenta) and audio-visual modalities (VoxCeleb1). Our proposed method achieves superior performance when all modalities are present as well as in the case of missing modalities during training or testing compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhonglin Chen, Anyu Geng, Jianan Jiang, Jiwu Lu, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although convolutional neural networks have made outstanding achievements in visible light target detection, there are still many challenges in infrared small object detection because of the low signal-to-noise ratio, incomplete object structure, and a lack of reliable infrared small object dataset. To resolve limitations of the infrared small object dataset, a new dataset named InfraTiny was constructed, and more than 85% bounding box is less than 32x32 pixels (3218 images and a total of 20,893 bounding boxes). A multi-scale attention mechanism module (MSAM) and a Feature Fusion Augmentation Pyramid Module (FFAFPM) were proposed and deployed onto embedded devices. The MSAM enables the network to obtain scale perception information by acquiring different receptive fields, while the background noise information is suppressed to enhance feature extraction ability. The proposed FFAFPM can enrich semantic information, and enhance the fusion of shallow feature and deep feature, thus false positive results have been significantly reduced. By integrating the proposed methods into the YOLO model, which is named Infra-YOLO, infrared small object detection performance has been improved. Compared to yolov3, mAP@0.5 has been improved by 2.7%; and compared to yolov4, that by 2.5% on the InfraTiny dataset. The proposed Infra-YOLO was also transferred onto the embedded device in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for real application scenarios, where the channel pruning method is adopted to reduce FLOPs and to achieve a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Even if the parameters of Infra-YOLO are reduced by 88% with the pruning method, a gain of 0.7% is still achieved on mAP@0.5 compared to yolov3, and a gain of 0.5% compared to yolov4. Experimental results show that the proposed MSAM and FFAFPM method can improve infrared small object detection performance compared with the previous benchmark method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate classification of blood cells is of vital significance in the diagnosis of hematological disorders. However, in real-world scenarios, domain shifts caused by the variability in laboratory procedures and settings, result in a rapid deterioration of the model's generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework of domain-invariant representation learning (DoRL) via segment anything model (SAM) for blood cell classification. The DoRL comprises two main components: a LoRA-based SAM (LoRA-SAM) and a cross-domain autoencoder (CAE). The advantage of DoRL is that it can extract domain-invariant representations from various blood cell datasets in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we first leverage the large-scale foundation model of SAM, fine-tuned with LoRA, to learn general image embeddings and segment blood cells. Additionally, we introduce CAE to learn domain-invariant representations across different-domain datasets while mitigating images' artifacts. To validate the effectiveness of domain-invariant representations, we employ five widely used machine learning classifiers to construct blood cell classification models. Experimental results on two public blood cell datasets and a private real dataset demonstrate that our proposed DoRL achieves a new state-of-the-art cross-domain performance, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao He, Huaao Tang, Zhijun Tu, Junchao Zhang, Kun Cheng, Hanting Chen, Yong Guo, Mingrui Zhu, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao, Jie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have shown promise in reconstructing high-resolution images with fine details from low-resolution counterparts. However, these approaches typically require tens or even hundreds of iterative samplings, resulting in significant latency. Recently, techniques have been devised to enhance the sampling efficiency of diffusion-based SR models via knowledge distillation. Nonetheless, when aligning the knowledge of student and teacher models, these solutions either solely rely on pixel-level loss constraints or neglect the fact that diffusion models prioritize varying levels of information at different time steps. To accomplish effective and efficient image super-resolution, we propose a time-aware diffusion distillation method, named TAD-SR. Specifically, we introduce a novel score distillation strategy to align the data distribution between the outputs of the student and teacher models after minor noise perturbation. This distillation strategy enables the student network to concentrate more on the high-frequency details. Furthermore, to mitigate performance limitations stemming from distillation, we integrate a latent adversarial loss and devise a time-aware discriminator that leverages diffusion priors to effectively distinguish between real images and generated images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and the teacher model in just one sampling step.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models usher a new era of video editing, flexibly manipulating the video contents with text prompts. Despite the widespread application demand in editing human-centered videos, these models face significant challenges in handling complex objects like humans. In this paper, we introduce DeCo, a novel video editing framework specifically designed to treat humans and the background as separate editable targets, ensuring global spatial-temporal consistency by maintaining the coherence of each individual component. Specifically, we propose a decoupled dynamic human representation that utilizes a parametric human body prior to generate tailored humans while preserving the consistent motions as the original video. In addition, we consider the background as a layered atlas to apply text-guided image editing approaches on it. To further enhance the geometry and texture of humans during the optimization, we extend the calculation of score distillation sampling into normal space and image space. Moreover, we tackle inconsistent lighting between the edited targets by leveraging a lighting-aware video harmonizer, a problem previously overlooked in decompose-edit-combine approaches. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate that DeCo outperforms prior video editing methods in human-centered videos, especially in longer videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous works have shown that reducing parameter overhead and computations for transformer-based single image super-resolution (SISR) models (e.g., SwinIR) usually leads to a reduction of performance. In this paper, we present GRFormer, an efficient and lightweight method, which not only reduces the parameter overhead and computations, but also greatly improves performance. The core of GRFormer is Grouped Residual Self-Attention (GRSA), which is specifically oriented towards two fundamental components. Firstly, it introduces a novel grouped residual layer (GRL) to replace the Query, Key, Value (QKV) linear layer in self-attention, aimed at efficiently reducing parameter overhead, computations, and performance loss at the same time. Secondly, it integrates a compact Exponential-Space Relative Position Bias (ES-RPB) as a substitute for the original relative position bias to improve the ability to represent position information while further minimizing the parameter count. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based methods for $\times$2, $\times$3 and $\times$4 SISR tasks, notably outperforming SOTA by a maximum PSNR of 0.23dB when trained on the DIV2K dataset, while reducing the number of parameter and MACs by about \textbf{60\%} and \textbf{49\% } in only self-attention module respectively. We hope that our simple and effective method that can easily applied to SR models based on window-division self-attention can serve as a useful tool for further research in image super-resolution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkwon Jin, Chang-Su Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: A novel algorithm for video lane detection is proposed in this paper. First, we extract a feature map for a current frame and detect a latent mask for obstacles occluding lanes. Then, we enhance the feature map by developing an occlusion-aware memory-based refinement (OMR) module. It takes the obstacle mask and feature map from the current frame, previous output, and memory information as input, and processes them recursively in a video. Moreover, we apply a novel data augmentation scheme for training the OMR module effectively. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing techniques on video lane datasets. Our codes are available at https://github.com/dongkwonjin/OMR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingfeng Huang, Yuxuan Cheng, Jingbo Xia, Rui Yu, Yuxuan Cai, Jinhai Xiang, Xinwei He, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have significantly advanced modern unsupervised anomaly detection. However, the strong capacity of neural networks often violates the underlying assumptions by reconstructing abnormal samples well. To alleviate this issue, we present a simple yet effective reconstruction framework named Attention-Guided Pertuation Network (AGPNet), which learns to add perturbation noise with an attention mask, for accurate unsupervised anomaly detection. Specifically, it consists of two branches, \ie, a plain reconstruction branch and an auxiliary attention-based perturbation branch. The reconstruction branch is simply a plain reconstruction network that learns to reconstruct normal samples, while the auxiliary branch aims to produce attention masks to guide the noise perturbation process for normal samples from easy to hard. By doing so, we are expecting to synthesize hard yet more informative anomalies for training, which enable the reconstruction branch to learn important inherent normal patterns both comprehensively and efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular benchmarks covering MVTec-AD, VisA, and MVTec-3D, and show that our framework obtains leading anomaly detection performance under various setups including few-shot, one-class, and multi-class setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhou Zhang, Wenlong Luo, De Cheng, Qingchun Yang, Lingyan Ran, Yinghui Xing, Yanning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark dataset for Ground-to-Aerial Video-based person Re-Identification, named G2A-VReID, which comprises 185,907 images and 5,576 tracklets, featuring 2,788 distinct identities. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for video ReID under Ground-to-Aerial scenarios. G2A-VReID dataset has the following characteristics: 1) Drastic view changes; 2) Large number of annotated identities; 3) Rich outdoor scenarios; 4) Huge difference in resolution. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark approach for cross-platform ReID by transforming the cross-platform visual alignment problem into visual-semantic alignment through vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) and applying a parameter-efficient Video Set-Level-Adapter module to adapt image-based foundation model to video ReID tasks, termed VSLA-CLIP. Besides, to further reduce the great discrepancy across the platforms, we also devise the platform-bridge prompts for efficient visual feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on all existing video ReID datasets and our proposed G2A-VReID dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'as Kalapos, B\'alint Gyires-T\'oth</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become an important approach in pretraining large neural networks, enabling unprecedented scaling of model and dataset sizes. While recent advances like I-JEPA have shown promising results for Vision Transformers, adapting such methods to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presents unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce CNN-JEPA, a novel SSL method that successfully applies the joint embedding predictive architecture approach to CNNs. Our method incorporates a sparse CNN encoder to handle masked inputs, a fully convolutional predictor using depthwise separable convolutions, and an improved masking strategy. We demonstrate that CNN-JEPA outperforms I-JEPA with ViT architectures on ImageNet-100, achieving 73.3% linear top-1 accuracy with a standard ResNet-50 encoder. Compared to other CNN-based SSL methods, CNN-JEPA requires 17-35% less training time for the same number of epochs and approaches the linear and k-NN top-1 accuracies of BYOL, SimCLR, and VICReg. Our approach offers a simpler, more efficient alternative to existing SSL methods for CNNs, requiring minimal augmentations and no separate projector network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanbo Zhou, Xinlin Zhang, Wei Deng, Tao Wang, Tao Tan, Qinquan Gao, Tong Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DiffSteISR, a pioneering framework for reconstructing real-world stereo images. DiffSteISR utilizes the powerful prior knowledge embedded in pre-trained text-to-image model to efficiently recover the lost texture details in low-resolution stereo images. Specifically, DiffSteISR implements a time-aware stereo cross attention with temperature adapter (TASCATA) to guide the diffusion process, ensuring that the generated left and right views exhibit high texture consistency thereby reducing disparity error between the super-resolved images and the ground truth (GT) images. Additionally, a stereo omni attention control network (SOA ControlNet) is proposed to enhance the consistency of super-resolved images with GT images in the pixel, perceptual, and distribution space. Finally, DiffSteISR incorporates a stereo semantic extractor (SSE) to capture unique viewpoint soft semantic information and shared hard tag semantic information, thereby effectively improving the semantic accuracy and consistency of the generated left and right images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffSteISR accurately reconstructs natural and precise textures from low-resolution stereo images while maintaining a high consistency of semantic and texture between the left and right views.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'as Kalapos, B\'alint Gyires-T\'oth</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been shown to be a powerful approach for learning visual representations. In this study, we propose incorporating ZCA whitening as the final layer of the encoder in self-supervised learning to enhance the quality of learned features by normalizing and decorrelating them. Although whitening has been utilized in SSL in previous works, its potential to universally improve any SSL model has not been explored. We demonstrate that adding whitening as the last layer of SSL pretrained encoders is independent of the self-supervised learning method and encoder architecture, thus it improves performance for a wide range of SSL methods across multiple encoder architectures and datasets. Our experiments show that whitening is capable of improving linear and k-NN probing accuracy by 1-5%. Additionally, we propose metrics that allow for a comprehensive analysis of the learned features, provide insights into the quality of the representations and help identify collapse patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juepeng Zheng, Yibin Wen, Jinxiao Zhang, Runmin Dong, Haohuan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we firstly tackle a more realistic Domain Adaptation (DA) setting: Source-Free Blending-Target Domain Adaptation (SF-BTDA), where we can not access to source domain data while facing mixed multiple target domains without any domain labels in prior. Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDA generally faces the co-existence of different label shifts in different targets, along with noisy target pseudo labels generated from the source model. In this paper, we propose a new method called Evidential Contrastive Alignment (ECA) to decouple the blending target domain and alleviate the effect from noisy target pseudo labels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of a same class in the blended target domains, which alleviates the co-existence of different label shifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets and ECA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Cao, Lishun Wang, Huan Wang, Guoqing Wang, Xin Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) uses a low-speed 2D camera to capture high-speed scenes as snapshot compressed measurements, followed by a reconstruction algorithm to retrieve the high-speed video frames. The fast evolving mobile devices and existing high-performance video SCI reconstruction algorithms motivate us to develop mobile reconstruction methods for real-world applications. Yet, it is still challenging to deploy previous reconstruction algorithms on mobile devices due to the complex inference process, let alone real-time mobile reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no video SCI reconstruction model designed to run on the mobile devices. Towards this end, in this paper, we present an effective approach for video SCI reconstruction, dubbed MobileSCI, which can run at real-time speed on the mobile devices for the first time. Specifically, we first build a U-shaped 2D convolution-based architecture, which is much more efficient and mobile-friendly than previous state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. Besides, an efficient feature mixing block, based on the channel splitting and shuffling mechanisms, is introduced as a novel bottleneck block of our proposed MobileSCI to alleviate the computational burden. Finally, a customized knowledge distillation strategy is utilized to further improve the reconstruction quality. Extensive results on both simulated and real data show that our proposed MobileSCI can achieve superior reconstruction quality with high efficiency on the mobile devices. Particularly, we can reconstruct a 256 X 256 X 8 snapshot compressed measurement with real-time performance (about 35 FPS) on an iPhone 15.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Cho, Hyunwoo Yu, Suk-ju Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring segmentation aims to segment a target object related to a natural language expression. Key challenges of this task are understanding the meaning of complex and ambiguous language expressions and determining the relevant regions in the image with multiple objects by referring to the expression. Recent models have focused on the early fusion with the language features at the intermediate stage of the vision encoder, but these approaches have a limitation that the language features cannot refer to the visual information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel architecture, Cross-aware early fusion with stage-divided Vision and Language Transformer encoders (CrossVLT), which allows both language and vision encoders to perform the early fusion for improving the ability of the cross-modal context modeling. Unlike previous methods, our method enables the vision and language features to refer to each other's information at each stage to mutually enhance the robustness of both encoders. Furthermore, unlike the conventional scheme that relies solely on the high-level features for the cross-modal alignment, we introduce a feature-based alignment scheme that enables the low-level to high-level features of the vision and language encoders to engage in the cross-modal alignment. By aligning the intermediate cross-modal features in all encoder stages, this scheme leads to effective cross-modal fusion. In this way, the proposed approach is simple but effective for referring image segmentation, and it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guan Luo, Tian-Xing Xu, Ying-Tian Liu, Xiao-Xiong Fan, Fang-Lue Zhang, Song-Hai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The modeling and manipulation of 3D scenes captured from the real world are pivotal in various applications, attracting growing research interest. While previous works on editing have achieved interesting results through manipulating 3D meshes, they often require accurately reconstructed meshes to perform editing, which limits their application in 3D content generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editing approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation via directly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimize the 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from a user-specified viewpoint of the original scene. To capture long-range object deformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization. To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, we build an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintaining structural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy to adaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in handling geometric details, long-range, and non-rigid deformation, demonstrating superior editing flexibility and quality compared to previous approaches.</p>

In this design, the camera lens is replaced by another optical element that interferes with the incoming light. The image is recovered from the raw sensor measurements using a reconstruction algorithm. Yet, the quality of the reconstructed images is not satisfactory. To mitigate this, we propose utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model with a control network and a learned separable transformation for reconstruction. This allows us to build a prototype flat camera with high-quality imaging, presenting state-of-the-art results in both terms of quality and perceptuality. We demonstrate its ability to leverage also textual descriptions of the captured scene to further enhance reconstruction. Our reconstruction method which leverages the strong capabilities of a pre-trained diffusion model can be used in other imaging systems for improved reconstruction results.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the evaluation of multimodal models in the context of mathematical problems has become a valuable research field. Multimodal visual-textual mathematical reasoning serves as a critical indicator for evaluating the comprehension and complex multi-step quantitative reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, previous multimodal math benchmarks have not sufficiently integrated visual and textual information. To address this gap, we proposed MathScape, a new benchmark that emphasizes the understanding and application of combined visual and textual information. MathScape is designed to evaluate photo-based math problem scenarios, assessing the theoretical understanding and application ability of MLLMs through a categorical hierarchical approach. We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation on 11 advanced MLLMs, revealing that our benchmark is challenging even for the most sophisticated models. By analyzing the evaluation results, we identify the limitations of MLLMs, offering valuable insights for enhancing model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beoungwoo Kang, Seunghun Moon, Yubin Cho, Hyunwoo Yu, Suk-Ju Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond the Transformer, it is important to explore how to exploit the capacity of the MetaFormer, an architecture that is fundamental to the performance improvements of the Transformer. Previous studies have exploited it only for the backbone network. Unlike previous studies, we explore the capacity of the Metaformer architecture more extensively in the semantic segmentation task. We propose a powerful semantic segmentation network, MetaSeg, which leverages the Metaformer architecture from the backbone to the decoder. Our MetaSeg shows that the MetaFormer architecture plays a significant role in capturing the useful contexts for the decoder as well as for the backbone. In addition, recent segmentation methods have shown that using a CNN-based backbone for extracting the spatial information and a decoder for extracting the global information is more effective than using a transformer-based backbone with a CNN-based decoder. This motivates us to adopt the CNN-based backbone using the MetaFormer block and design our MetaFormer-based decoder, which consists of a novel self-attention module to capture the global contexts. To consider both the global contexts extraction and the computational efficiency of the self-attention for semantic segmentation, we propose a Channel Reduction Attention (CRA) module that reduces the channel dimension of the query and key into the one dimension. In this way, our proposed MetaSeg outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods with more efficient computational costs on popular semantic segmentation and a medical image segmentation benchmark, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-stuff, and Synapse.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyang Ye, Qiming Hou, Kun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose progressive radiance distillation, an inverse rendering method that combines physically-based rendering with Gaussian-based radiance field rendering using a distillation progress map. Taking multi-view images as input, our method starts from a pre-trained radiance field guidance, and distills physically-based light and material parameters from the radiance field using an image-fitting process. The distillation progress map is initialized to a small value, which favors radiance field rendering. During early iterations when fitted light and material parameters are far from convergence, the radiance field fallback ensures the sanity of image loss gradients and avoids local minima that attracts under-fit states. As fitted parameters converge, the physical model gradually takes over and the distillation progress increases correspondingly. In presence of light paths unmodeled by the physical model, the distillation progress never finishes on affected pixels and the learned radiance field stays in the final rendering. With this designed tolerance for physical model limitations, we prevent unmodeled color components from leaking into light and material parameters, alleviating relighting artifacts. Meanwhile, the remaining radiance field compensates for the limitations of the physical model, guaranteeing high-quality novel views synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques quality-wise in both novel view synthesis and relighting. The idea of progressive radiance distillation is not limited to Gaussian splatting. We show that it also has positive effects for prominently specular scenes when adapted to a mesh-based inverse rendering method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaijing Ma, Han Fang, Xianghao Zang, Chao Ban, Lanxiang Zhou, Zhongjiang He, Yongxiang Li, Hao Sun, Zerun Feng, Xingsong Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval, which aims to locate in-context video moments according to a natural language query, is an essential task for cross-modal grounding. Existing methods focus on enhancing the cross-modal interactions between all moments and the textual description for video understanding. However, constantly interacting with all locations is unreasonable because of uneven semantic distribution across the timeline and noisy visual backgrounds. This paper proposes a cross-modal Context Denoising Network (CDNet) for accurate moment retrieval by disentangling complex correlations and denoising irrelevant dynamics.Specifically, we propose a query-guided semantic disentanglement (QSD) to decouple video moments by estimating alignment levels according to the global and fine-grained correlation. A Context-aware Dynamic Denoisement (CDD) is proposed to enhance understanding of aligned spatial-temporal details by learning a group of query-relevant offsets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CDNet achieves state-of-the-art performances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liting Jiang, Feng Wang, Wenyi Zhang, Peifeng Li, Hongjian You, Yuming Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo matching, a critical step of 3D reconstruction, has fully shifted towards deep learning due to its strong feature representation of remote sensing images. However, ground truth for stereo matching task relies on expensive airborne LiDAR data, thus making it difficult to obtain enough samples for supervised learning. To improve the generalization ability of stereo matching networks on cross-domain data from different sensors and scenarios, in this paper, we dedicate to study key training factors from three perspectives. (1) For the selection of training dataset, it is important to select data with similar regional target distribution as the test set instead of utilizing data from the same sensor. (2) For model structure, cascaded structure that flexibly adapts to different sizes of features is preferred. (3) For training manner, unsupervised methods generalize better than supervised methods, and we design an unsupervised early-stop strategy to help retain the best model with pre-trained weights as the basis. Extensive experiments are conducted to support the previous findings, on the basis of which we present an unsupervised stereo matching network with good generalization performance. We release the source code and the datasets at https://github.com/Elenairene/RKF_RSSM to reproduce the results and encourage future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: While deep face recognition models have demonstrated remarkable performance, they often struggle on the inputs from domains beyond their training data. Recent attempts aim to expand the training set by relying on computationally expensive and inherently challenging image-space augmentation of image generation modules. In an orthogonal direction, we present a simple yet effective method to expand the training data by interpolating between instance-level feature statistics across labeled and unlabeled sets. Our method, dubbed Targeted Style Adversary (TSA), is motivated by two observations: (i) the input domain is reflected in feature statistics, and (ii) face recognition model performance is influenced by style information. Shifting towards an unlabeled style implicitly synthesizes challenging training instances. We devise a recognizability metric to constraint our framework to preserve the inherent identity-related information of labeled instances. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through evaluations on unconstrained benchmarks, outperforming or being on par with its competitors while offering nearly a 70\% improvement in training speed and 40\% less memory consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjung Kim, Hyung Suk Lim, Seung Hwan Kim, Soonyoung Lee, Bumsoo Kim, Gunhee Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D dense captioning is a task to localize objects in a 3D scene and generate descriptive sentences for each object. Recent approaches in 3D dense captioning have adopted transformer encoder-decoder frameworks from object detection to build an end-to-end pipeline without hand-crafted components. However, these approaches struggle with contradicting objectives where a single query attention has to simultaneously view both the tightly localized object regions and contextual environment. To overcome this challenge, we introduce SIA (See-It-All), a transformer pipeline that engages in 3D dense captioning with a novel paradigm called late aggregation. SIA simultaneously decodes two sets of queries-context query and instance query. The instance query focuses on localization and object attribute descriptions, while the context query versatilely captures the region-of-interest of relationships between multiple objects or with the global scene, then aggregated afterwards (i.e., late aggregation) via simple distance-based measures. To further enhance the quality of contextualized caption generation, we design a novel aggregator to generate a fully informed caption based on the surrounding context, the global environment, and object instances. Extensive experiments on two of the most widely-used 3D dense captioning datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a significant improvement over prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Yang, Zitong Yu, Xiuming Ni, Jia He, Hui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In videos containing spoofed faces, we may uncover the spoofing evidence based on either photometric or dynamic abnormality, even a combination of both. Prevailing face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches generally concentrate on the single-frame scenario, however, purely photometric-driven methods overlook the dynamic spoofing clues that may be exposed over time. This may lead FAS systems to conclude incorrect judgments, especially in cases where it is easily distinguishable in terms of dynamics but challenging to discern in terms of photometrics. To this end, we propose the Graph Guided Video Vision Transformer (G$^2$V$^2$former), which combines faces with facial landmarks for photometric and dynamic feature fusion. We factorize the attention into space and time, and fuse them via a spatiotemporal block. Specifically, we design a novel temporal attention called Kronecker temporal attention, which has a wider receptive field, and is beneficial for capturing dynamic information. Moreover, we leverage the low-semantic motion of facial landmarks to guide the high-semantic change of facial expressions based on the motivation that regions containing landmarks may reveal more dynamic clues. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance under various scenarios. The codes will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius Aasan, Odd Kolbj{\o}rnsen, Anne Schistad Solberg, Ad\'in Ramirez Rivera</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures traditionally employ a grid-based approach to tokenization independent of the semantic content of an image. We propose a modular superpixel tokenization strategy which decouples tokenization and feature extraction; a shift from contemporary approaches where these are treated as an undifferentiated whole. Using on-line content-aware tokenization and scale- and shape-invariant positional embeddings, we perform experiments and ablations that contrast our approach with patch-based tokenization and randomized partitions as baselines. We show that our method significantly improves the faithfulness of attributions, gives pixel-level granularity on zero-shot unsupervised dense prediction tasks, while maintaining predictive performance in classification tasks. Our approach provides a modular tokenization framework commensurable with standard architectures, extending the space of ViTs to a larger class of semantically-rich models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darshan Venkatrayappa, Philippe Montesinos, Daniel Diep, Baptiste Magnier</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the new and powerful image patch descriptor based on second order image statistics/derivatives. Here, the image patch is treated as a 3D surface with intensity being the 3rd dimension. The considered 3D surface has a rich set of second order features/statistics such as ridges, valleys, cliffs and so on, that can be easily captured by using the difference of rotating semi Gaussian filters. The originality of this method is based on successfully combining the response of the directional filters with that of the Difference of Gaussian (DOG) approach. The obtained descriptor shows a good discriminative power when dealing with the variations in illumination, scale, rotation, blur, viewpoint and compression. The experiments on image matching, demonstrates the advantage of the obtained descriptor when compared to its first order counterparts such as SIFT, DAISY, GLOH, GIST and LIDRIC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudipta Banerjee, Arun Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: Near-duplicate images are often generated when applying repeated photometric and geometric transformations that produce imperceptible variants of the original image. Consequently, a deluge of near-duplicates can be circulated online posing copyright infringement concerns. The concerns are more severe when biometric data is altered through such nuanced transformations. In this work, we address the challenge of near-duplicate detection in face images by, firstly, identifying the original image from a set of near-duplicates and, secondly, deducing the relationship between the original image and the near-duplicates. We construct a tree-like structure, called an Image Phylogeny Tree (IPT) using a graph-theoretic approach to estimate the relationship, i.e., determine the sequence in which they have been generated. We further extend our method to create an ensemble of IPTs known as Image Phylogeny Forests (IPFs). We rigorously evaluate our method to demonstrate robustness across other modalities, unseen transformations by latest generative models and IPT configurations, thereby significantly advancing the state-of-the-art performance by 42% on IPF reconstruction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghao Lin, Ying Zeng, Sijie Mai, Haifeng Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), understanding human's affection is essential to enhance machine's cognition abilities. For achieving more sensual human-AI interaction, Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) in human-spoken videos has attracted increasing attention. However, previous methods are mainly devoted to designing multimodal fusion algorithms, suffering from two issues: semantic imbalance caused by diverse pre-processing operations and semantic mismatch raised by inconsistent affection content contained in different modalities comparing with the multimodal ground truth. Besides, the usage of manual features extractors make they fail in building end-to-end pipeline for multiple MAC downstream tasks. To address above challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named SemanticMAC to compute multimodal semantic-centric affection for human-spoken videos. We firstly employ pre-trained Transformer model in multimodal data pre-processing and design Affective Perceiver module to capture unimodal affective information. Moreover, we present a semantic-centric approach to unify multimodal representation learning in three ways, including gated feature interaction, multi-task pseudo label generation, and intra-/inter-sample contrastive learning. Finally, SemanticMAC effectively learn specific- and shared-semantic representations in the guidance of semantic-centric labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpass the state-of-the-art methods on 7 public datasets in four MAC downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wujie Sun, Defang Chen, Siwei Lyu, Genlang Chen, Chun Chen, Can Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on knowledge distillation has increasingly focused on logit distillation because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and versatility in model compression. In this paper, we introduce Refined Logit Distillation (RLD) to address the limitations of current logit distillation methods. Our approach is motivated by the observation that even high-performing teacher models can make incorrect predictions, creating a conflict between the standard distillation loss and the cross-entropy loss. This conflict can undermine the consistency of the student model's learning objectives. Previous attempts to use labels to empirically correct teacher predictions may undermine the class correlation. In contrast, our RLD employs labeling information to dynamically refine teacher logits. In this way, our method can effectively eliminate misleading information from the teacher while preserving crucial class correlations, thus enhancing the value and efficiency of distilled knowledge. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. The code is provided at \text{https://github.com/zju-SWJ/RLD}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atefe Hassani, Islem Rek</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in federated learning lies in mixing heterogeneous datasets and classification tasks while minimizing the high communication cost caused by clients as well as the exchange of weight updates with the server over a fixed number of rounds. This results in divergent model convergence rates and performance, which may hinder their deployment in precision medicine. In real-world scenarios, client data is collected from different hospitals with extremely varying components (e.g., imaging modality, organ type, etc). Previous studies often overlooked the convoluted heterogeneity during the training stage where the target learning tasks vary across clients as well as the dataset type and their distributions. To address such limitations, we unprecedentedly introduce UniFed, a universal federated learning paradigm that aims to classify any disease from any imaging modality. UniFed also handles the issue of varying convergence times in the client-specific optimization based on the complexity of their learning tasks. Specifically, by dynamically adjusting both local and global models, UniFed considers the varying task complexities of clients and the server, enhancing its adaptability to real-world scenarios, thereby mitigating issues related to overtraining and excessive communication. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a sequential model transfer mechanism that takes into account the diverse tasks among hospitals and a dynamic task-complexity based ordering. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and convergence time over relevant benchmarks in diagnosing retina, histopathology, and liver tumour diseases under federated learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Alberto Barbano, Matteo Brunello, Benoit Dufumier, Marco Grangetto</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with a weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dino Ienco (EVERGREEN, UMR TETIS, INRAE), Cassio Fraga Dantas (UMR TETIS, INRAE, EVERGREEN)</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal knowledge distillation (CMKD) refers to the scenario in which a learning framework must handle training and test data that exhibit a modality mismatch, more precisely, training and test data do not cover the same set of data modalities. Traditional approaches for CMKD are based on a teacher/student paradigm where a teacher is trained on multi-modal data with the aim to successively distill knowledge from a multi-modal teacher to a single-modal student. Despite the widespread adoption of such paradigm, recent research has highlighted its inherent limitations in the context of cross-modal knowledge transfer.Taking a step beyond the teacher/student paradigm, here we introduce a new framework for cross-modal knowledge distillation, named DisCoM-KD (Disentanglement-learning based Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation), that explicitly models different types of per-modality information with the aim to transfer knowledge from multi-modal data to a single-modal classifier. To this end, DisCoM-KD effectively combines disentanglement representation learning with adversarial domain adaptation to simultaneously extract, foreach modality, domain-invariant, domain-informative and domain-irrelevant features according to a specific downstream task. Unlike the traditional teacher/student paradigm, our framework simultaneously learns all single-modal classifiers, eliminating the need to learn each student model separately as well as the teacher classifier. We evaluated DisCoM-KD on three standard multi-modal benchmarks and compared its behaviourwith recent SOTA knowledge distillation frameworks. The findings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of DisCoM-KD over competitors considering mismatch scenarios involving both overlapping and non-overlapping modalities. These results offer insights to reconsider the traditional paradigm for distilling information from multi-modal data to single-modal neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Qi, Chen Feng, Fan Zhang, Xiaozhong Xu, Shan Liu, David Bull</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, user-generated content (UGC) has become one of the major video types consumed via streaming networks. Numerous research contributions have focused on assessing its visual quality through subjective tests and objective modeling. In most cases, objective assessments are based on a no-reference scenario, where the corresponding reference content is assumed not to be available. However, full-reference video quality assessment is also important for UGC in the delivery pipeline, particularly associated with the video transcoding process. In this context, we present a new UGC video quality database, BVI-UGC, for user-generated content transcoding, which contains 60 (non-pristine) reference videos and 1,080 test sequences. In this work, we simulated the creation of non-pristine reference sequences (with a wide range of compression distortions), typical of content uploaded to UGC platforms for transcoding. A comprehensive crowdsourced subjective study was then conducted involving more than 3,500 human participants. Based on this collected subjective data, we benchmarked the performance of 10 full-reference and 11 no-reference quality metrics. Our results demonstrate the poor performance (SROCC values are lower than 0.6) of these metrics in predicting the perceptual quality of UGC in two different scenarios (with or without a reference).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enhao Zhang, Chaohua Li, Chuanxing Geng, Songcan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) presents an elegant geometric structure that enables individual activations (features), class means and classifier (weights) vectors to reach \textit{optimal} inter-class separability during the terminal phase of training on a \textit{balanced} dataset. Once shifted to imbalanced classification, such an optimal structure of NC can be readily destroyed by the notorious \textit{minority collapse}, where the classifier vectors corresponding to the minority classes are squeezed. In response, existing works endeavor to recover NC typically by optimizing classifiers. However, we discover that this squeezing phenomenon is not only confined to classifier vectors but also occurs with class means.
  Consequently, reconstructing NC solely at the classifier aspect may be futile, as the feature means remain compressed, leading to the violation of inherent \textit{self-duality} in NC (\textit{i.e.}, class means and classifier vectors converge mutually) and incidentally, resulting in an unsatisfactory collapse of individual activations towards the corresponding class means. To shake off these dilemmas, we present a unified \textbf{All}-around \textbf{N}eural \textbf{C}ollapse framework (AllNC), aiming to comprehensively restore NC across multiple aspects including individual activations, class means and classifier vectors. We thoroughly analyze its effectiveness and verify on multiple benchmark datasets that it achieves state-of-the-art in both balanced and imbalanced settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning brought boosts to auto diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis, thus, greatly helping ophthalmologists for early disease detection, which contributes to preventing disease deterioration that may eventually lead to blindness. It has been proved that convolutional neural network (CNN)-aided lesion identifying or segmentation benefits auto DR screening. The key to fine-grained lesion tasks mainly lies in: (1) extracting features being both sensitive to tiny lesions and robust against DR-irrelevant interference, and (2) exploiting and re-using encoded information to restore lesion locations under extremely imbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a CNN-based DR diagnosis network with attention mechanism involved, termed lesion-aware network, to better capture lesion information from imbalanced data. Specifically, we design the lesion-aware module (LAM) to capture noise-like lesion areas across deeper layers, and the feature-preserve module (FPM) to assist shallow-to-deep feature fusion. Afterward, the proposed lesion-aware network (LANet) is constructed by embedding the LAM and FPM into the CNN decoders for DR-related information utilization. The proposed LANet is then further extended to a DR screening network by adding a classification layer. Through experiments on three public fundus datasets with pixel-level annotations, our method outperforms the mainstream methods with an area under curve of 0.967 in DR screening, and increases the overall average precision by 7.6%, 2.1%, and 1.2% in lesion segmentation on three datasets. Besides, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of the proposed sub-modules.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN's potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Meituan's online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Migraine, a prevalent neurological disorder, has been associated with various ocular manifestations suggestive of neuronal and microvascular deficits. However, there is limited understanding of the extent to which retinal imaging may discriminate between individuals with migraines versus without migraines. In this study, we apply convolutional neural networks to color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) data to investigate differences in the retina that may not be apparent through traditional human-based interpretations of retinal imaging. Retrospective data of CFP type 1 [posterior pole] and type 2 [optic nerve head (ONH)] from 369 and 336 participants respectively were analyzed. All participants had bilaterally normal optic nerves and maculae, with no retinal-involving diseases. CFP images were concatenated with OCT default ONH measurements, then inputted through three convolutional neural networks - VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inceptionv3. The primary outcome was performance of discriminating between with migraines versus without migraines, using retinal microvascular and neuronal imaging characteristics. Using CFP type 1 data, discrimination (AUC [95% CI]) was high (0.84 [0.8, 0.88] to 0.87 [0.84, 0.91]) and not significantly different between VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inceptionv3. Using CFP type 2 [ONH] data, discrimination was reduced and ranged from poor to fair (0.69 [0.62, 0.77] to 0.74 [0.67, 0.81]). OCT default ONH measurements overall did not significantly contribute to model performance. Class activation maps (CAMs) highlighted that the paravascular arcades were regions of interest. The findings suggest that individuals with migraines demonstrate microvascular differences more so than neuronal differences in comparison to individuals without migraines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia-Hong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (2) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (3) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

<p>Abstract: Most datasets used for supervised machine learning consist of a single label per data point. However, in cases where more information than just the class label is available, would it be possible to train models more efficiently? We introduce two novel model architectures, which we call hybrid concept-based models, that train using both class labels and additional information in the dataset referred to as concepts. In order to thoroughly assess their performance, we introduce ConceptShapes, an open and flexible class of datasets with concept labels. We show that the hybrid concept-based models outperform standard computer vision models and previously proposed concept-based models with respect to accuracy, especially in sparse data settings. We also introduce an algorithm for performing adversarial concept attacks, where an image is perturbed in a way that does not change a concept-based model's concept predictions, but changes the class prediction. The existence of such adversarial examples raises questions about the interpretable qualities promised by concept-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senmao Wang, Haifan Gong, Runmeng Cui, Boyao Wan, Yicheng Liu, Zhonglin Hu, Haiqing Yang, Jingyang Zhou, Bo Pan, Lin Lin, Haiyue Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Costal cartilage segmentation is crucial to various medical applications, necessitating precise and reliable techniques due to its complex anatomy and the importance of accurate diagnosis and surgical planning. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach called topology-guided deformable Mamba (TGDM) for costal cartilage segmentation. The TGDM is tailored to capture the intricate long-range costal cartilage relationships. Our method leverages a deformable model that integrates topological priors to enhance the adaptability and accuracy of the segmentation process. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive benchmark that contains 165 cases for costal cartilage segmentation. This benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating costal cartilage segmentation techniques and provides a valuable resource for future research. Extensive experiments conducted on both in-domain benchmarks and out-of domain test sets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods, showing significant improvements in segmentation precision and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Xu, Hao Xu, Matthew Sinclair, Esther Puyol-Ant\'on, Steven A Niederer, Amedeo Chiribiri, Steven E Williams, Michelle C Williams, Alistair A Young</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are two common non-invasive imaging methods for assessing patients with cardiovascular disease. CMR typically acquires multiple sparse 2D slices, with unavoidable respiratory motion artefacts between slices, whereas CT acquires isotropic dense data but uses ionising radiation. In this study, we explore the combination of Slice Shifting Algorithm (SSA), Spatial Transformer Network (STN), and Label Transformer Network (LTN) to: 1) correct respiratory motion between segmented slices, and 2) transform sparse segmentation data into dense segmentation. All combinations were validated using synthetic motion-corrupted CMR slice segmentation generated from CT in 1699 cases, where the dense CT serves as the ground truth. In 199 testing cases, SSA-LTN achieved the best results for Dice score and Huasdorff distance (94.0% and 4.7 mm respectively, average over 5 labels) but gave topological errors in 8 cases. STN was effective as a plug-in tool for correcting all topological errors with minimal impact on overall performance (93.5% and 5.0 mm respectively). SSA also proves to be a valuable plug-in tool, enhancing performance over both STN-based and LTN-based models. The code for these different combinations is available at https://github.com/XESchong/STACOM2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Villani, Dario Lazzaro, Antonio Emanuele Cin\`a, Matteo Dell'Amico, Battista Biggio, Fabio Roli</p>
<p>Abstract: Data poisoning attacks on clustering algorithms have received limited attention, with existing methods struggling to scale efficiently as dataset sizes and feature counts increase. These attacks typically require re-clustering the entire dataset multiple times to generate predictions and assess the attacker's objectives, significantly hindering their scalability. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing Sonic, a novel genetic data poisoning attack that leverages incremental and scalable clustering algorithms, e.g., FISHDBC, as surrogates to accelerate poisoning attacks against graph-based and density-based clustering methods, such as HDBSCAN. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Sonic in poisoning the target clustering algorithms. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting the scalability and transferability of poisoning attacks against clustering algorithms, and we conclude by examining the robustness of hyperparameters in our attack strategy Sonic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinjoni Mukhopadhyay King, Faisal Nawab, Katia Obraczka</p>
<p>Abstract: The current state-of-the-art in user mobility research has extensively relied on open-source mobility traces captured from pedestrian and vehicular activity through a variety of communication technologies as users engage in a wide-range of applications, including connected healthcare, localization, social media, e-commerce, etc. Most of these traces are feature-rich and diverse, not only in the information they provide, but also in how they can be used and leveraged. This diversity poses two main challenges for researchers and practitioners who wish to make use of available mobility datasets. First, it is quite difficult to get a bird's eye view of the available traces without spending considerable time looking them up. Second, once they have found the traces, they still need to figure out whether the traces are adequate to their needs.
  The purpose of this survey is three-fold. It proposes a taxonomy to classify open-source mobility traces including their mobility mode, data source and collection technology. It then uses the proposed taxonomy to classify existing open-source mobility traces and finally, highlights three case studies using popular publicly available datasets to showcase how our taxonomy can tease out feature sets in traces to help determine their applicability to specific use-cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailing Guo, Zhenquan Lin, Canyang Chen, Xiaofen Xing, Fang Liu, Xiangmin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rankness plays an important role in traditional machine learning, but is not so popular in deep learning. Most previous low-rank network compression methods compress networks by approximating pre-trained models and re-training. However, the optimal solution in the Euclidean space may be quite different from the one with low-rank constraint. A well-pre-trained model is not a good initialization for the model with low-rank constraints. Thus, the performance of a low-rank compressed network degrades significantly. Compared with other network compression methods such as pruning, low-rank methods attract less attention in recent years. In this paper, we devise a new training method, low-rank projection with energy transfer (LRPET), that trains low-rank compressed networks from scratch and achieves competitive performance. We propose to alternately perform stochastic gradient descent training and projection of each weight matrix onto the corresponding low-rank manifold. Compared to re-training on the compact model, this enables full utilization of model capacity since solution space is relaxed back to Euclidean space after projection. The matrix energy (the sum of squares of singular values) reduction caused by projection is compensated by energy transfer. We uniformly transfer the energy of the pruned singular values to the remaining ones. We theoretically show that energy transfer eases the trend of gradient vanishing caused by projection. In modern networks, a batch normalization (BN) layer can be merged into the previous convolution layer for inference, thereby influencing the optimal low-rank approximation of the previous layer. We propose BN rectification to cut off its effect on the optimal low-rank approximation, which further improves the performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqi Chen, Yushuang Wu, Qiyuan Dai, Hong-Yu Zhou, Mutian Xu, Sibei Yang, Xiaoguang Han, Yizhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained momentum in graph representation learning and boosted the state of the art in a variety of areas, such as data mining (\emph{e.g.,} social network analysis and recommender systems), computer vision (\emph{e.g.,} object detection and point cloud learning), and natural language processing (\emph{e.g.,} relation extraction and sequence learning), to name a few. With the emergence of Transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, graph Transformers embed a graph structure into the Transformer architecture to overcome the limitations of local neighborhood aggregation while avoiding strict structural inductive biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of GNNs and graph Transformers in computer vision from a task-oriented perspective. Specifically, we divide their applications in computer vision into five categories according to the modality of input data, \emph{i.e.,} 2D natural images, videos, 3D data, vision + language, and medical images. In each category, we further divide the applications according to a set of vision tasks. Such a task-oriented taxonomy allows us to examine how each task is tackled by different GNN-based approaches and how well these approaches perform. Based on the necessary preliminaries, we provide the definitions and challenges of the tasks, in-depth coverage of the representative approaches, as well as discussions regarding insights, limitations, and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Zhou, Zhen Li, Chun-Le Guo, Li Liu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Qibin Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous works have shown that increasing the window size for Transformer-based image super-resolution models (e.g., SwinIR) can significantly improve the model performance. Still, the computation overhead is also considerable when the window size gradually increases. In this paper, we present SRFormer, a simple but novel method that can enjoy the benefit of large window self-attention but introduces even less computational burden. The core of our SRFormer is the permuted self-attention (PSA), which strikes an appropriate balance between the channel and spatial information for self-attention. Without any bells and whistles, we show that our SRFormer achieves a 33.86dB PSNR score on the Urban100 dataset, which is 0.46dB higher than that of SwinIR but uses fewer parameters and computations. In addition, we also attempt to scale up the model by further enlarging the window size and channel numbers to explore the potential of Transformer-based models. Experiments show that our scaled model, named SRFormerV2, can further improve the results and achieves state-of-the-art. We hope our simple and effective approach could be useful for future research in super-resolution model design. The homepage is https://z-yupeng.github.io/SRFormer/.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new learning approach, Soft Conditional Prompt Learning (SCP), which leverages the strengths of prompt learning for aerial video action recognition. Our approach is designed to predict the action of each agent by helping the models focus on the descriptions or instructions associated with actions in the input videos for aerial/robot visual perception. Our formulation supports various prompts, including learnable prompts, auxiliary visual information, and large vision models to improve the recognition performance. We present a soft conditional prompt method that learns to dynamically generate prompts from a pool of prompt experts under different video inputs. By sharing the same objective with the task, our proposed SCP can optimize prompts that guide the model's predictions while explicitly learning input-invariant (prompt experts pool) and input-specific (data-dependent) prompt knowledge. In practice, we observe a 3.17-10.2% accuracy improvement on the aerial video datasets (Okutama, NECDrone), which consist of scenes with single-agent and multi-agent actions. We further evaluate our approach on ground camera videos to verify the effectiveness and generalization and achieve a 1.0-3.6% improvement on dataset SSV2. We integrate our method into the ROS2 as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Li, Jianing Qiu, Michael Spratling</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial training (AT) is an effective defense against adversarial examples. However, AT is prone to overfitting which degrades robustness substantially. Recently, data augmentation (DA) was shown to be effective in mitigating robust overfitting if appropriately designed and optimized for AT. This work proposes a new method to automatically learn online, instance-wise, DA policies to improve robust generalization for AT. This is the first automated DA method specific for robustness. A novel policy learning objective, consisting of Vulnerability, Affinity and Diversity, is proposed and shown to be sufficiently effective and efficient to be practical for automatic DA generation during AT. Importantly, our method dramatically reduces the cost of policy search from the 5000 hours of AutoAugment and the 412 hours of IDBH to 9 hours, making automated DA more practical to use for adversarial robustness. This allows our method to efficiently explore a large search space for a more effective DA policy and evolve the policy as training progresses. Empirically, our method is shown to outperform all competitive DA methods across various model architectures and datasets. Our DA policy reinforced vanilla AT to surpass several state-of-the-art AT methods regarding both accuracy and robustness. It can also be combined with those advanced AT methods to further boost robustness. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/AROID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yajie Cui, Zhaoxiang Liu, Shiguo Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection without priors of the anomalies is challenging. In the field of unsupervised anomaly detection, traditional auto-encoder (AE) tends to fail based on the assumption that by training only on normal images, the model will not be able to reconstruct abnormal images correctly. On the contrary, we propose a novel patch-wise auto-encoder (Patch AE) framework, which aims at enhancing the reconstruction ability of AE to anomalies instead of weakening it. Each patch of image is reconstructed by corresponding spatially distributed feature vector of the learned feature representation, i.e., patch-wise reconstruction, which ensures anomaly-sensitivity of AE. Our method is simple and efficient. It advances the state-of-the-art performances on Mvtec AD benchmark, which proves the effectiveness of our model. It shows great potential in practical industrial application scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nafiseh Kakhani, Moien Rangzan, Ali Jamali, Sara Attarchi, Seyed Kazem Alavipanah, Michael Mommert, Nikolaos Tziolas, Thomas Scholten</p>
<p>Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) constitutes a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystem functionality, playing a pivotal role in nutrient cycling, hydrological balance, and erosion mitigation. Precise mapping of SOC distribution is imperative for the quantification of ecosystem services, notably carbon sequestration and soil fertility enhancement. Digital soil mapping (DSM) leverages statistical models and advanced technologies, including machine learning (ML), to accurately map soil properties, such as SOC, utilizing diverse data sources like satellite imagery, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate series. Within the domain of ML, self-supervised learning (SSL), which exploits unlabeled data, has gained prominence in recent years. This study introduces a novel approach that aims to learn the geographical link between multimodal features via self-supervised contrastive learning, employing pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) for image inputs and Transformers for climate data, before fine-tuning the model with ground reference samples. The proposed approach has undergone rigorous testing on two distinct large-scale datasets, with results indicating its superiority over traditional supervised learning models, which depends solely on labeled data. Furthermore, through the utilization of various evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, CCC, etc.), the proposed model exhibits higher accuracy when compared to other conventional ML algorithms like random forest and gradient boosting. This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and contributes to the advancement of DSM techniques, thereby facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Zhang, Xingyu Li, Waqas Sultani, Chen Chen, Safwan Wshah</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) estimates the location of a ground image by matching it to a geo-tagged aerial image in a database. Recent works achieve outstanding progress on CVGL benchmarks. However, existing methods still suffer from poor performance in cross-area evaluation, in which the training and testing data are captured from completely distinct areas. We attribute this deficiency to the lack of ability to extract the geometric layout of visual features and models' overfitting to low-level details. Our preliminary work introduced a Geometric Layout Extractor (GLE) to capture the geometric layout from input features. However, the previous GLE does not fully exploit information in the input feature. In this work, we propose GeoDTR+ with an enhanced GLE module that better models the correlations among visual features. To fully explore the LS techniques from our preliminary work, we further propose Contrastive Hard Samples Generation (CHSG) to facilitate model training. Extensive experiments show that GeoDTR+ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in cross-area evaluation on CVUSA, CVACT, and VIGOR by a large margin ($16.44\%$, $22.71\%$, and $13.66\%$ without polar transformation) while keeping the same-area performance comparable to existing SOTA. Moreover, we provide detailed analyses of GeoDTR+. Our code will be available at https://gitlab.com/vail-uvm/geodtr plus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Shen, Kun Hu, Wei Bao, Chang Wen Chen, Zhiyong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand-drawn 2D animation workflow is typically initiated with the creation of sketch keyframes. Subsequent manual inbetweens are crafted for smoothness, which is a labor-intensive process and the prospect of automatic animation sketch interpolation has become highly appealing. Yet, common frame interpolation methods are generally hindered by two key issues: 1) limited texture and colour details in sketches, and 2) exaggerated alterations between two sketch keyframes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep learning method - Sketch-Aware Interpolation Network (SAIN). This approach incorporates multi-level guidance that formulates region-level correspondence, stroke-level correspondence and pixel-level dynamics. A multi-stream U-Transformer is then devised to characterize sketch inbetweening patterns using these multi-level guides through the integration of self / cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, to facilitate future research on animation sketch inbetweening, we constructed a large-scale dataset - STD-12K, comprising 30 sketch animation series in diverse artistic styles. Comprehensive experiments on this dataset convincingly show that our proposed SAIN surpasses the state-of-the-art interpolation methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The accurate reconstruction of dynamic scenes with neural radiance fields is significantly dependent on the estimation of camera poses. Widely used structure-from-motion pipelines encounter difficulties in accurately tracking the camera trajectory when faced with separate dynamics of the scene content and the camera movement. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Motion-Aware Fast and Robust Camera Localization for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DynaMoN). DynaMoN utilizes semantic segmentation and generic motion masks to handle dynamic content for initial camera pose estimation and statics-focused ray sampling for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis. Our novel iterative learning scheme switches between training the NeRF and updating the pose parameters for an improved reconstruction and trajectory estimation quality. The proposed pipeline shows significant acceleration of the training process. We extensively evaluate our approach on two real-world dynamic datasets, the TUM RGB-D dataset and the BONN RGB-D Dynamic dataset. DynaMoN improves over the state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality and trajectory accuracy. We plan to make our code public to enhance research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Hendrik Metzen, Piyapat Saranrittichai, Chaithanya Kumar Mummadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifiers built upon vision-language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable zero-shot performance across a broad range of image classification tasks. Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language model to templates built from random words and characters. Up until now, deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors has remained nearly unchanged, i.e., classify to the class that maximizes cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the image encoding. However, weighing all class descriptors equally can be suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP tunes per-image weights to each prompt template at inference time, based on statistics of class descriptor-image similarities. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has only a minor additional computation overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that AutoCLIP outperforms baselines across a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates consistently and by up to 3 percent point accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyuan Yang, Jianfeng Wang, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Chung-Ching Lin, Zicheng Liu, Lijuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ``Idea to Image,'' a system that enables multimodal iterative self-refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for automatic image design and generation. Humans can quickly identify the characteristics of different text-to-image (T2I) models via iterative explorations. This enables them to efficiently convert their high-level generation ideas into effective T2I prompts that can produce good images. We investigate if systems based on large multimodal models (LMMs) can develop analogous multimodal self-refinement abilities that enable exploring unknown models or environments via self-refining tries. Idea2Img cyclically generates revised T2I prompts to synthesize draft images, and provides directional feedback for prompt revision, both conditioned on its memory of the probed T2I model's characteristics. The iterative self-refinement brings Idea2Img various advantages over vanilla T2I models. Notably, Idea2Img can process input ideas with interleaved image-text sequences, follow ideas with design instructions, and generate images of better semantic and visual qualities. The user preference study validates the efficacy of multimodal iterative self-refinement on automatic image design and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Dang, Minnan Luo, Chengyou Jia, Guang Dai, Jihong Wang, Xiaojun Chang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoding only the task-related information from the raw data, \ie, disentangled representation learning, can greatly contribute to the robustness and generalizability of models. Although significant advances have been made by regularizing the information in representations with information theory, two major challenges remain: 1) the representation compression inevitably leads to performance drop; 2) the disentanglement constraints on representations are in complicated optimization. To these issues, we introduce Bayesian networks with transmitted information to formulate the interaction among input and representations during disentanglement. Building upon this framework, we propose \textbf{DisTIB} (\textbf{T}ransmitted \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck for \textbf{Dis}entangled representation learning), a novel objective that navigates the balance between information compression and preservation. We employ variational inference to derive a tractable estimation for DisTIB. This estimation can be simply optimized via standard gradient descent with a reparameterization trick. Moreover, we theoretically prove that DisTIB can achieve optimal disentanglement, underscoring its superior efficacy. To solidify our claims, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks to demonstrate the appealing efficacy of DisTIB and validate our theoretical analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanwang Yang, Qiao Feng, Yu-Kun Lai, Kun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Rendering 3D human appearance from a single image in real-time is crucial for achieving holographic communication and immersive VR/AR. Existing methods either rely on multi-camera setups or are constrained to offline operations. In this paper, we propose R2Human, the first approach for real-time inference and rendering of photorealistic 3D human appearance from a single image. The core of our approach is to combine the strengths of implicit texture fields and explicit neural rendering with our novel representation, namely Z-map. Based on this, we present an end-to-end network that performs high-fidelity color reconstruction of visible areas and provides reliable color inference for occluded regions. To further enhance the 3D perception ability of our network, we leverage the Fourier occupancy field as a prior for generating the texture field and providing a sampling surface in the rendering stage. We also propose a consistency loss and a spatial fusion strategy to ensure the multi-view coherence. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and challenging real-world images, in real-time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfei Xiao, Ziqi Zhou, Wenxuan Li, Shiyi Lan, Jieru Mei, Zhiding Yu, Alan Yuille, Yuyin Zhou, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ProLab, a novel approach using property-level label space for creating strong interpretable segmentation models. Instead of relying solely on category-specific annotations, ProLab uses descriptive properties grounded in common sense knowledge for supervising segmentation models. It is based on two core designs. First, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) and carefully crafted prompts to generate descriptions of all involved categories that carry meaningful common sense knowledge and follow a structured format. Second, we introduce a description embedding model preserving semantic correlation across descriptions and then cluster them into a set of descriptive properties (e.g., 256) using K-Means. These properties are based on interpretable common sense knowledge consistent with theories of human recognition. We empirically show that our approach makes segmentation models perform stronger on five classic benchmarks (e.g., ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Pascal Context, Cityscapes, and BDD). Our method also shows better scalability with extended training steps than category-level supervision. Our interpretable segmentation framework also emerges with the generalization ability to segment out-of-domain or unknown categories using only in-domain descriptive properties.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqin Dai, Wanlu Zhu, Ronghui Li, Zeping Ren, Xiangzheng Zhou, Xiu Li, Jun Li, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating group choreography from music has gained attention in cultural entertainment and virtual reality, aiming to coordinate visually cohesive and diverse group movements. Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuel Ben-Baruch, Adam Botach, Igor Kviatkovsky, Manoj Aggarwal, G\'erard Medioni</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing size of datasets used for training neural networks, data pruning becomes an attractive field of research. However, most current data pruning algorithms are limited in their ability to preserve accuracy compared to models trained on the full data, especially in high pruning regimes. In this paper we explore the application of data pruning while incorporating knowledge distillation (KD) when training on a pruned subset. That is, rather than relying solely on ground-truth labels, we also use the soft predictions from a teacher network pre-trained on the complete data. By integrating KD into training, we demonstrate significant improvement across datasets, pruning methods, and on all pruning fractions. We first establish a theoretical motivation for employing self-distillation to improve training on pruned data. Then, we empirically make a compelling and highly practical observation: using KD, simple random pruning is comparable or superior to sophisticated pruning methods across all pruning regimes. On ImageNet for example, we achieve superior accuracy despite training on a random subset of only 50% of the data. Additionally, we demonstrate a crucial connection between the pruning factor and the optimal knowledge distillation weight. This helps mitigate the impact of samples with noisy labels and low-quality images retained by typical pruning algorithms. Finally, we make an intriguing observation: when using lower pruning fractions, larger teachers lead to accuracy degradation, while surprisingly, employing teachers with a smaller capacity than the student's may improve results. Our code will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Jiang, Xinglin Li, Weiren Yu, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of fashion design, sketches serve as the canvas for expressing an artist's distinctive drawing style and creative vision, capturing intricate details like stroke variations and texture nuances. The advent of sketch-to-image cross-modal translation technology has notably aided designers. However, existing methods often compromise these sketch details during image generation, resulting in images that deviate from the designer's intended concept. This limitation hampers the ability to offer designers a precise preview of the final output. To overcome this challenge, we introduce HAIFIT, a novel approach that transforms sketches into high-fidelity, lifelike clothing images by integrating multi-scale features and capturing extensive feature map dependencies from diverse perspectives. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on our self-collected dataset, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in generating photorealistic clothing images. Our method excels in preserving the distinctive style and intricate details essential for fashion design applications. In addition, our method also has obvious advantages in model training and inference speed, contributing to reducing designers' time costs and improving design efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Salman Shamil, Dibyadip Chatterjee, Fadime Sener, Shugao Ma, Angela Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D hand pose is an underexplored modality for action recognition. Poses are compact yet informative and can greatly benefit applications with limited compute budgets. However, poses alone offer an incomplete understanding of actions, as they cannot fully capture objects and environments with which humans interact. We propose HandFormer, a novel multimodal transformer, to efficiently model hand-object interactions. HandFormer combines 3D hand poses at a high temporal resolution for fine-grained motion modeling with sparsely sampled RGB frames for encoding scene semantics. Observing the unique characteristics of hand poses, we temporally factorize hand modeling and represent each joint by its short-term trajectories. This factorized pose representation combined with sparse RGB samples is remarkably efficient and highly accurate. Unimodal HandFormer with only hand poses outperforms existing skeleton-based methods at 5x fewer FLOPs. With RGB, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on Assembly101 and H2O with significant improvements in egocentric action recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingding Cai, Janne Heikkil\"a, Esa Rahtu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces GS-Pose, a unified framework for localizing and estimating the 6D pose of novel objects. GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database. Extensive evaluations on the LINEMOD and OnePose-LowTexture datasets demonstrate excellent performance, establishing the new state-of-the-art. Project page: https://dingdingcai.github.io/gs-pose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Sarafianos, Tuur Stuyck, Xiaoyu Xiang, Yilei Li, Jovan Popovic, Rakesh Ranjan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Garment3DGen a new method to synthesize 3D garment assets from a base mesh given a single input image as guidance. Our proposed approach allows users to generate 3D textured clothes based on both real and synthetic images, such as those generated by text prompts. The generated assets can be directly draped and simulated on human bodies. We leverage the recent progress of image-to-3D diffusion methods to generate 3D garment geometries. However, since these geometries cannot be utilized directly for downstream tasks, we propose to use them as pseudo ground-truth and set up a mesh deformation optimization procedure that deforms a base template mesh to match the generated 3D target. Carefully designed losses allow the base mesh to freely deform towards the desired target, yet preserve mesh quality and topology such that they can be simulated. Finally, we generate high-fidelity texture maps that are globally and locally consistent and faithfully capture the input guidance, allowing us to render the generated 3D assets. With Garment3DGen users can generate the simulation-ready 3D garment of their choice without the need of artist intervention. We present a plethora of quantitative and qualitative comparisons on various assets and demonstrate that Garment3DGen unlocks key applications ranging from sketch-to-simulated garments or interacting with the garments in VR.

We introduced a Deep Learning model able to re-frame the surfaces where light bounces happen as a virtual mirror. This modeling makes the task easier to handle and also facilitates the construction of annotated training data. From the obtained data it is possible to retrieve the depth information of the hidden scene.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Wu, Chaohui Yu, Yanqin Jiang, Chenjie Cao, Fan Wang, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 2D/3D generative models enable the generation of dynamic 3D objects from a single-view video. Existing approaches utilize score distillation sampling to form the dynamic scene as dynamic NeRF or dense 3D Gaussians. However, these methods struggle to strike a balance among reference view alignment, spatio-temporal consistency, and motion fidelity under single-view conditions due to the implicit nature of NeRF or the intricate dense Gaussian motion prediction. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient, sparse-controlled video-to-4D framework named SC4D, that decouples motion and appearance to achieve superior video-to-4D generation. Moreover, we introduce Adaptive Gaussian (AG) initialization and Gaussian Alignment (GA) loss to mitigate shape degeneration issue, ensuring the fidelity of the learned motion and shape. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing methods in both quality and efficiency. In addition, facilitated by the disentangled modeling of motion and appearance of SC4D, we devise a novel application that seamlessly transfers the learned motion onto a diverse array of 4D entities according to textual descriptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the growing success of 3D-aware GANs, which can be trained on 2D images to generate high-quality 3D assets, they still rely on multi-view images with camera annotations to synthesize sufficient details from all viewing directions. However, the scarce availability of calibrated multi-view image datasets, especially in comparison to single-view images, has limited the potential of 3D GANs. Moreover, while bypassing camera pose annotations with a camera distribution constraint reduces dependence on exact camera parameters, it still struggles to generate a consistent orientation of 3D assets. To this end, we propose SYM3D, a novel 3D-aware GAN designed to leverage the prevalent reflectional symmetry structure found in natural and man-made objects, alongside a proposed view-aware spatial attention mechanism in learning the 3D representation. We evaluate SYM3D on both synthetic (ShapeNet Chairs, Cars, and Airplanes) and real-world datasets (ABO-Chair), demonstrating its superior performance in capturing detailed geometry and texture, even when trained on only single-view images. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating symmetry regularization in helping reduce artifacts in the modeling of 3D assets in the text-to-3D task.

<p>Abstract: This survey addresses the critical challenge of deepfake detection amidst the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. As AI-generated media, including video, audio and text, become more realistic, the risk of misuse to spread misinformation and commit identity fraud increases. Focused on face-centric deepfakes, this work traces the evolution from traditional single-modality methods to sophisticated multi-modal approaches that handle audio-visual and text-visual scenarios. We provide comprehensive taxonomies of detection techniques, discuss the evolution of generative methods from auto-encoders and GANs to diffusion models, and categorize these technologies by their unique attributes. To our knowledge, this is the first survey of its kind. We also explore the challenges of adapting detection methods to new generative models and enhancing the reliability and robustness of deepfake detectors, proposing directions for future research. This survey offers a detailed roadmap for researchers, supporting the development of technologies to counter the deceptive use of AI in media creation, particularly facial forgery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefanos Pertigkiozoglou, Evangelos Chatzipantazis, Kostas Daniilidis</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of this paper is to address the problem of global point cloud registration (PCR) i.e., finding the optimal alignment between point clouds irrespective of the initial poses of the scans. This problem is notoriously challenging for classical optimization methods due to computational constraints. First, we show that state-of-the-art deep learning methods suffer from huge performance degradation when the point clouds are arbitrarily placed in space. We propose that equivariant deep learning should be utilized for solving this task and we characterize the specific type of bi-equivariance of PCR. Then, we design BiEquiformer a novel and scalable bi-equivariant pipeline i.e. equivariant to the independent transformations of the input point clouds. While a naive approach would process the point clouds independently we design expressive bi-equivariant layers that fuse the information from both point clouds. This allows us to extract high-quality superpoint correspondences and in turn, robust point-cloud registration. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art methods show that our method achieves comparable performance in the canonical setting and superior performance in the robust setting in both the 3DMatch and the challenging low-overlap 3DLoMatch dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Frascaroli, Aniello Panariello, Pietro Buzzega, Lorenzo Bonicelli, Angelo Porrello, Simone Calderara</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of Transformers and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP, fine-tuning large pre-trained models has recently become a prevalent strategy in Continual Learning. This has led to the development of numerous prompting strategies to adapt transformer-based models without incurring catastrophic forgetting. However, these strategies often compromise the original zero-shot capabilities of the pre-trained CLIP model and struggle to adapt to domains that significantly deviate from the pre-training data. In this work, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning, a simple and novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting CLIP. Briefly, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn class-conditioned distributions within the embedding space of the visual encoder. We then exploit these distributions to sample new synthetic visual embeddings and train the corresponding class-specific textual prompts during subsequent tasks. Through extensive experiments on different domains, we show that such a generative replay approach can adapt to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities, evaluated using a novel metric tailored for CL scenarios. Notably, further analysis reveals that our approach can bridge the gap with joint prompt tuning. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted much attention for their multifunctionality. However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model, which utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear scalability and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer-based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning while also trying various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments in various multimodal benchmark tests demonstrate the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlight the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning. We propose a novel multimodal connector called the Mamba-2 Scan Connector (MSC), which enhances representational capabilities. (2) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling while faster inference speed; (3) Compared to multimodal models utilizing Mamba-1, the Mamba-2-based ML-Mamba exhibits superior inference performance and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farukh Yaushev, Daria Nogina, Valentin Samokhin, Mariya Dugova, Ekaterina Petrash, Dmitry Sevryukov, Mikhail Belyaev, Maxim Pisov</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding body part geometry is crucial for precise medical diagnostics. Curves effectively describe anatomical structures and are widely used in medical imaging applications related to cardiovascular, respiratory, and skeletal diseases. Traditional curve detection methods are often task-specific, relying heavily on domain-specific features, limiting their broader applicability. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting non-branching curves, which does not require prior knowledge of the object's orientation, shape, or position. Our method uses neural networks to predict (1) an attraction field, which offers subpixel accuracy, and (2) a closeness map, which limits the region of interest and essentially eliminates outliers far from the desired curve. We tested our curve detector on several clinically relevant tasks with diverse morphologies and achieved impressive subpixel-level accuracy results that surpass existing methods, highlighting its versatility and robustness. Additionally, to support further advancements in this field, we provide our private annotations of aortic centerlines and masks, which can serve as a benchmark for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Lai, Chuanhao Liu, Shihui Sheng, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection in autonomous driving is critical yet challenging due to occlusions, varying object scales, and complex urban environments. This paper introduces the RCBEV-KAN algorithm, a pioneering method designed to enhance 3D object detection by fusing multimodal sensor data from cameras, LiDAR, and millimeter-wave radar. Our innovative Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approach, utilizing a Transformer architecture, significantly boosts detection precision and efficiency by seamlessly integrating diverse data sources, improving spatial relationship handling, and optimizing computational processes. Experimental results show that the RCBEV-KAN model demonstrates superior performance across most detection categories, achieving higher Mean Distance AP (0.389 vs. 0.316, a 23% improvement), better ND Score (0.484 vs. 0.415, a 17% improvement), and faster Evaluation Time (71.28s, 8% faster). These results indicate that RCBEV-KAN is more accurate, reliable, and efficient, making it ideal for dynamic and challenging autonomous driving environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Chen, Xiaozhen Qiao, Zhe Sun, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model excels in integrating semantic information between images and text through contrastive learning techniques. It has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, the deployment of large CLIP models is hindered in resource-limited environments, while smaller models frequently fail to meet the performance benchmarks required for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ComKD-CLIP: Comprehensive Knowledge Distillation for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-traning Model, which aims to comprehensively distill the knowledge from a large teacher CLIP model into a smaller student model, ensuring comparable performance with significantly reduced parameters. ComKD-CLIP is composed of two key mechanisms: Image Feature Alignment (IFAlign) and Educational Attention (EduAttention). IFAlign makes the image features extracted by the student model closely match those extracted by the teacher model, enabling the student to learn teacher's knowledge of extracting image features. EduAttention explores the cross-relationships between text features extracted by the teacher model and image features extracted by the student model, enabling the student model to learn how the teacher model integrates text-image features. In addition, ComKD-CLIP can refine the knowledge distilled from IFAlign and EduAttention by leveraging the text-image feature fusion results of the teacher model, ensuring the student model accurately absorbs the teacher's knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingbei Meng, Bi'an Du, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction stands as a formidable challenge in computer vision, aiming to build complete three-dimensional models from a limited array of viewing perspectives. This task confronts several difficulties: 1) the limited number of input images that lack consistent information; 2) dependence on the quality of input images; and 3) the substantial size of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a self-augmented coarse-to-fine Gaussian splatting paradigm, enhanced with a structure-aware mask, for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. In particular, our method initially employs a coarse Gaussian model to obtain a basic 3D representation from sparse-view inputs. Subsequently, we develop a fine Gaussian network to enhance consistent and detailed representation of the output with both 3D geometry augmentation and perceptual view augmentation. During training, we design a structure-aware masking strategy to further improve the model's robustness against sparse inputs and noise.Experimental results on the MipNeRF360 and OmniObject3D datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances for sparse input views in both perceptual quality and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rukesh Prajapati, Amr S. El-Wakeel</p>
<p>Abstract: Road intersection monitoring and control research often utilize bird's eye view (BEV) simulators. In real traffic settings, achieving a BEV akin to that in a simulator necessitates the deployment of drones or specific sensor mounting, which is neither feasible nor practical. Consequently, traffic intersection management remains confined to simulation environments given these constraints. In this paper, we address the gap between simulated environments and real-world implementation by introducing a novel deep-learning model that converts a single camera's perspective of a road intersection into a BEV. We created a simulation environment that closely resembles a real-world traffic junction. The proposed model transforms the vehicles into BEV images, facilitating road intersection monitoring and control model processing. Inspired by image transformation techniques, we propose a Spatial-Transformer Double Decoder-UNet (SDD-UNet) model that aims to eliminate the transformed image distortions. In addition, the model accurately estimates the vehicle's positions and enables the direct application of simulation-trained models in real-world contexts. SDD-UNet model achieves an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) above 95% which is 40% better than the original UNet model. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.102 and the centroid of the predicted mask is 0.14 meters displaced, on average, indicating high accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasiliy Alekseev, Ilya Lukashevich, Ilia Zharikov, Ilya Vasiliev</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural network models have a complex architecture and are overparameterized. The number of parameters is more than the whole dataset, which is highly resource-consuming. This complicates their application and limits its usage on different devices. Reduction in the number of network parameters helps to reduce the size of the model, but at the same time, thoughtlessly applied, can lead to a deterioration in the quality of the network. One way to reduce the number of model parameters is matrix decomposition, where a matrix is represented as a product of smaller matrices. In this paper, we propose a new way of applying the matrix decomposition with respect to the weights of convolutional layers. The essence of the method is to train not all convolutions, but only the subset of convolutions (basis convolutions), and represent the rest as linear combinations of the basis ones. Experiments on models from the ResNet family and the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that basis convolutions can not only reduce the size of the model but also accelerate the forward and backward passes of the network. Another contribution of this work is that we propose a fast method for selecting a subset of network layers in which the use of matrix decomposition does not degrade the quality of the final model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcella Astrid, Enjie Ghorbel, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods on audio-visual deepfake detection mainly focus on high-level features for modeling inconsistencies between audio and visual data. As a result, these approaches usually overlook finer audio-visual artifacts, which are inherent to deepfakes. Herein, we propose the introduction of fine-grained mechanisms for detecting subtle artifacts in both spatial and temporal domains. First, we introduce a local audio-visual model capable of capturing small spatial regions that are prone to inconsistencies with audio. For that purpose, a fine-grained mechanism based on a spatially-local distance coupled with an attention module is adopted. Second, we introduce a temporally-local pseudo-fake augmentation to include samples incorporating subtle temporal inconsistencies in our training set. Experiments on the DFDC and the FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of generalization as compared to the state-of-the-art under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guozhen Zhang, Jingyu Liu, Shengming Cao, Xiaotong Zhao, Kevin Zhao, Kai Ma, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) from image-text matching has sparked an interest in image-to-video adaptation. However, most current approaches retain the full forward pass for each frame, leading to a high computation overhead for processing entire videos. In this paper, we present InTI, a novel approach for compressive image-to-video adaptation using dynamic Inter-frame Token Interpolation. InTI aims to softly preserve the informative tokens without disrupting their coherent spatiotemporal structure. Specifically, each token pair at identical positions within neighbor frames is linearly aggregated into a new token, where the aggregation weights are generated by a multi-scale context-aware network. In this way, the information of neighbor frames can be adaptively compressed in a point-by-point manner, thereby effectively reducing the number of processed frames by half each time. Importantly, InTI can be seamlessly integrated with existing adaptation methods, achieving strong performance without extra-complex design. On Kinetics-400, InTI reaches a top-1 accuracy of 87.1 with a remarkable 37.5% reduction in GFLOPs compared to naive adaptation. When combined with additional temporal modules, InTI achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.6 with a 37% reduction in GFLOPs. Similar conclusions have been verified in other common datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a novel matrix-encoding method that is particularly convenient for neural networks to make predictions in a privacy-preserving manner using homomorphic encryption. Based on this encoding method, we implement a convolutional neural network for handwritten image classification over encryption. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform homomorphic multiplication, the main idea behind it, in a simple version, is to encrypt matrix $A$ and the transpose of matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively. With additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication can be calculated over encrypted matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation, we in advance span each convolution kernel to a matrix space of the same size as the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which is later used together with the ciphertext encrypting input images for calculating some of the final convolution results. We accumulate all these intermediate results and thus complete the convolution operation.
  In a public cloud with 40 vCPUs, our convolutional neural network implementation on the MNIST testing dataset takes $\sim$ 287 seconds to compute ten likelihoods of 32 encrypted images of size $28 \times 28$ simultaneously. The data owner only needs to upload one ciphertext ($\sim 19.8$ MB) encrypting these 32 images to the public cloud.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoshan Liu, Qiujie Lv, Yifan Li, Ziduo Yang, Lei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) has been widely leveraged in computer vision to alleviate the data shortage, whereas the DA in medical image analysis (MIA) faces multiple challenges. The prevalent DA approaches in MIA encompass conventional DA, synthetic DA, and automatic DA. However, utilizing these approaches poses various challenges such as experience-driven design and intensive computation cost. Here, we propose an efficient and effective automatic DA method termed MedAugment. We propose a pixel augmentation space and spatial augmentation space and exclude the operations that can break medical details and features, such as severe color distortions or structural alterations that can compromise image diagnostic value. Besides, we propose a novel sampling strategy by sampling a limited number of operations from the two spaces. Moreover, we present a hyperparameter mapping relationship to produce a rational augmentation level and make the MedAugment fully controllable using a single hyperparameter. These configurations settle the differences between natural and medical images, such as high sensitivity to certain attributes such as brightness and posterize. Extensive experimental results on four classification and four segmentation datasets demonstrate the superiority of MedAugment. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed MedAugment serves as a more suitable yet general processing pipeline for medical images without producing color distortions or structural alterations and involving negligible computational overhead. We emphasize that our method can serve as a plugin for arbitrary projects without any extra training stage, thereby holding the potential to make a valuable contribution to the medical field, particularly for medical experts without a solid foundation in deep learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Chen, Xuanyu Zhang, Shuai Liu, Yongbing Zhang, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising tool for reducing sampling costs. Current deep neural network (NN)-based CS methods face the challenges of collecting labeled measurement-ground truth (GT) data and generalizing to real applications. This paper proposes a novel $\mathbf{S}$elf-supervised s$\mathbf{C}$alable deep CS method, comprising a deep $\mathbf{L}$earning scheme called $\mathbf{SCL}$ and a family of $\mathbf{Net}$works named $\mathbf{SCNet}$, which does not require GT and can handle arbitrary sampling ratios and matrices once trained on a partial measurement set. Our SCL contains a dual-domain loss and a four-stage recovery strategy. The former encourages a cross-consistency on two measurement parts and a sampling-reconstruction cycle-consistency regarding arbitrary ratios and matrices to maximize data/information utilization. The latter can progressively leverage common signal prior in external measurements and internal characteristics of test samples and learned NNs to improve accuracy. SCNet combines both the explicit guidance from optimization algorithms with implicit regularization from advanced NN blocks to learn a collaborative signal representation. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 1-/2-/3-D natural and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, superior performance, flexibility, and generalization ability of our method over existing self-supervised methods and its significant potential in competing against state-of-the-art supervised methods.

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. However, conventional surface mesh generation methods, such as active shape models and multi-atlas segmentation, are highly time-consuming and require complex processing pipelines to generate simulation-ready 3D meshes. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multiview HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity and simulation ready meshes from CMR images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the contents of multimodal documents is essential to accurately extract relevant evidence and use it for reasoning. Existing document understanding models tend to generate answers with a single word or phrase directly, ignoring the source document's evidence and lacking interpretability. In this work, we address the lack of step-wise capabilities through data augmentation and extension. Specifically, We use Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which have strong visual understanding and reasoning abilities, as data generators to generate step-wise question-and-answer pairs for document images and use a high-performance LLM as the error detector to filter out noisy data. This step-wise data generation pipeline is implemented using both template-based and few-shot methods. We then use the generated high-quality data to train a humanized document understanding and reasoning model, specifically designed to solve complex questions that require reasoning or multi-hop question answering, dubbed DocAssistant. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and application value of step-wise generation, showing a 5 improvement on InfoVQA with complex layouts and a 7 improvement on ChartQA with complex reasoning, compared to directly generated answers. We hope our work highlights the potential of synthetic data and encourages further exploration of multi-modal document reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are an increasingly integral part of modern factory and warehouse operations. Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonggeun Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision, explainable AI (xAI) methods seek to mitigate the 'black-box' problem by making the decision-making process of deep learning models more interpretable and transparent. Traditional xAI methods concentrate on visualizing input features that influence model predictions, providing insights primarily suited for experts. In this work, we present an interaction-based xAI method that enhances user comprehension of image classification models through their interaction. Thus, we developed a web-based prototype allowing users to modify images via painting and erasing, thereby observing changes in classification results. Our approach enables users to discern critical features influencing the model's decision-making process, aligning their mental models with the model's logic. Experiments conducted with five images demonstrate the potential of the method to reveal feature importance through user interaction. Our work contributes a novel perspective to xAI by centering on end-user engagement and understanding, paving the way for more intuitive and accessible explainability in AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinchi Zhou, Tianqi Chen, Jun Hou, Huidong Xie, Nicha C. Dvornek, S. Kevin Zhou, David L. Wilson, James S. Duncan, Chi Liu, Bo Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-image translation is a vital component in medical imaging processing, with many uses in a wide range of imaging modalities and clinical scenarios. Previous methods include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), which offer realism but suffer from instability and lack uncertainty estimation. Even though both GAN and DM methods have individually exhibited their capability in medical image translation tasks, the potential of combining a GAN and DM to further improve translation performance and to enable uncertainty estimation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a Cascade Multi-path Shortcut Diffusion Model (CMDM) for high-quality medical image translation and uncertainty estimation. To reduce the required number of iterations and ensure robust performance, our method first obtains a conditional GAN-generated prior image that will be used for the efficient reverse translation with a DM in the subsequent step. Additionally, a multi-path shortcut diffusion strategy is employed to refine translation results and estimate uncertainty. A cascaded pipeline further enhances translation quality, incorporating residual averaging between cascades. We collected three different medical image datasets with two sub-tasks for each dataset to test the generalizability of our approach. Our experimental results found that CMDM can produce high-quality translations comparable to state-of-the-art methods while providing reasonable uncertainty estimations that correlate well with the translation error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amelie Sophie Robrecht, Hendric Voss, Lisa Gottschalk, Stefan Kopp</p>
<p>Abstract: In human interaction, gestures serve various functions such as marking speech rhythm, highlighting key elements, and supplementing information. These gestures are also observed in explanatory contexts. However, the impact of gestures on explanations provided by virtual agents remains underexplored. A user study was carried out to investigate how different types of gestures influence perceived interaction quality and listener understanding. This study addresses the effect of gestures in explanation by developing an embodied virtual explainer integrating both beat gestures and iconic gestures to enhance its automatically generated verbal explanations. Our model combines beat gestures generated by a learned speech-driven synthesis module with manually captured iconic gestures, supporting the agent's verbal expressions about the board game Quarto! as an explanation scenario. Findings indicate that neither the use of iconic gestures alone nor their combination with beat gestures outperforms the baseline or beat-only conditions in terms of understanding. Nonetheless, compared to prior research, the embodied agent significantly enhances understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luoxiao Yang, Yun Wang, Xinqi Fan, Israel Cohen, Jingdong Chen, Yue Zhao, Zijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Vettoruzzo, Joaquin Vanschoren, Mohamed-Rafik Bouguelia, Thorsteinn R\"ognvaldsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability to continually learn over time by accommodating new knowledge while retaining previously learned experience. While this concept is inherent in human learning, current machine learning methods are highly prone to overwrite previously learned patterns and thus forget past experience. Instead, model parameters should be updated selectively and carefully, avoiding unnecessary forgetting while optimally leveraging previously learned patterns to accelerate future learning. Since hand-crafting effective update mechanisms is difficult, we propose meta-learning a transformer-based optimizer to enhance CL. This meta-learned optimizer uses attention to learn the complex relationships between model parameters across a stream of tasks, and is designed to generate effective weight updates for the current task while preventing catastrophic forgetting on previously encountered tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets like SplitMNIST, RotatedMNIST, and SplitCIFAR-100 affirm the efficacy of the proposed approach in terms of both forward and backward transfer, even on small sets of labeled data, highlighting the advantages of integrating a meta-learned optimizer within the continual learning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Daza, Luis F. Gomez, Julian Fierrez, Aythami Morales, Ruben Tolosana, Javier Ortega-Garcia</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces an innovative method for estimating attention levels (cognitive load) using an ensemble of facial analysis techniques applied to webcam videos. Our method is particularly useful, among others, in e-learning applications, so we trained, evaluated, and compared our approach on the mEBAL2 database, a public multi-modal database acquired in an e-learning environment. mEBAL2 comprises data from 60 users who performed 8 different tasks. These tasks varied in difficulty, leading to changes in their cognitive loads. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art facial analysis technologies to quantify the users' cognitive load in the form of high or low attention. Several behavioral signals and physiological processes related to the cognitive load are used, such as eyeblink, heart rate, facial action units, and head pose, among others. Furthermore, we conduct a study to understand which individual features obtain better results, the most efficient combinations, explore local and global features, and how temporary time intervals affect attention level estimation, among other aspects. We find that global facial features are more appropriate for multimodal systems using score-level fusion, particularly as the temporal window increases. On the other hand, local features are more suitable for fusion through neural network training with score-level fusion approaches. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art accuracies using the public mEBAL2 benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Tayyab Khan, Wenhe Feng, Lequn Chen, Ye Han Ng, Nicholas Yew Jin Tan, Seung Ki Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) plays a crucial role in modern manufacturing, facilitating seamless transitions from digital designs to physical products. However, a significant challenge within this integration is the Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) of CAD models, especially in the context of hybrid manufacturing that combines subtractive and additive manufacturing processes. Traditional AFR methods, focused mainly on the identification of subtractive (machined) features including holes, fillets, chamfers, pockets, and slots, fail to recognize features pertinent to additive manufacturing. Furthermore, the traditional methods fall short in accurately extracting geometric dimensions and orientations, which are also key factors for effective manufacturing process planning. This paper presents a novel approach for creating a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses features relevant to both additive and subtractive machining through Python Open Cascade. The Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCNN) model is implemented to accurately identify the composite additive-subtractive features within the synthetic CAD dataset. The key novelty and contribution of the proposed methodology lie in its ability to recognize a wide range of manufacturing features, and precisely extracting their dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes. The proposed model demonstrates remarkable feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy of 100% for identified features. Therefore, the proposed methodology enhances the integration of CAD, CAPP, and CAM within hybrid manufacturing by providing precise feature recognition and dimension extraction. It facilitates improved manufacturing process planning, by enabling more informed decision-making.</p>
