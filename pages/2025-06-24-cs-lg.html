<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Luo, Jia Wang, Dapeng Lan, Yu Liu, Zhibo Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs. This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer (MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE) layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelin Zang, Fei Wang, Liangyu Li, Jinlin Wu, Chunshui Zhao, Zhen Lei, Baigui Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation: foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet, VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results, validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Payam Zohari, Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of data integration for multi-omics data has emerged as a powerful strategy to unravel the complex biological underpinnings of cancer. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer an effective framework to model heterogeneous and structured omics data, enabling precise representation of molecular interactions and regulatory networks. This systematic review explores several recent studies that leverage GNN-based architectures in multi-omics cancer research. We classify the approaches based on their targeted omics layers, graph neural network structures, and biological tasks such as subtype classification, prognosis prediction, and biomarker discovery. The analysis reveals a growing trend toward hybrid and interpretable models, alongside increasing adoption of attention mechanisms and contrastive learning. Furthermore, we highlight the use of patient-specific graphs and knowledge-driven priors as emerging directions. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers aiming to design effective GNN-based pipelines for integrative cancer analysis, offering insights into current practices, limitations, and potential future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth M. Narayanan, James D. Braza, Ryan-Rhys Griffiths, Albert Bou, Geemi Wellawatte, Mayk Caldas Ramos, Ludovico Mitchener, Samuel G. Rodriques, Andrew D. White</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew B. Kahng, Yiting Liu, Zhiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and (ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS) within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17248">Efficient Quantification of Multimodal Interaction at Sample Level</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zequn Yang, Hongfa Wang, Di Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy -- collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this, we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware model ensembling.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17249">Improving Prediction Certainty Estimation for Reliable Early Exiting via Null Space Projection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianing He, Qi Zhang, Duoqian Miao, Yi Kun, Shufeng Hao, Hongyun Zhang, Zhihua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty, causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off between task performance and inference efficiency.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17250">Towards Interpretable Adversarial Examples via Sparse Adversarial Attack</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fudong Lin, Jiadong Lou, Hao Wang, Brian Jalaian, Xu Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels (i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength. In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition, theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e., "obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17251">Training-free LLM Verification via Recycling Few-shot Examples</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongseok Lee, Jimyung Hong, Dongyoung Kim, Jaehyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Huang, Yikun Ban, Lean Fu, Xiaojie Li, Zhongxiang Dai, Jianxin Li, Deqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm, simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of fixed preference datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoang Li, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii) solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to the optimum in practical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunan Zou, Ziyun Zhang, Xueting Sun, Guojie Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights, importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity, alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects: (1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124). Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains. Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions, contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical region contributing to model predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma: how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic and continual learning settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikai Long, Zijian Hu, Xiaodong Yu, Jianwen Xie, Zhaozhuo Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO) offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order tuning regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianren Zhang, Hui Liu, Delvin Ce Zhang, Xianfeng Tang, Qi He, Dongwon Lee, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model. Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jusheng Zhang, Kaitong Cai, Yijia Fan, Jian Wang, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations, indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring reliable reasoning and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satyam Mishra, Phung Thao Vi, Shivam Mishra, Vishwanath Bijalwan, Vijay Bhaskar Semwal, Abdul Manan Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SafeRL-Lite, an open-source Python library for building reinforcement learning (RL) agents that are both constrained and explainable. Existing RL toolkits often lack native mechanisms for enforcing hard safety constraints or producing human-interpretable rationales for decisions. SafeRL-Lite provides modular wrappers around standard Gym environments and deep Q-learning agents to enable: (i) safety-aware training via constraint enforcement, and (ii) real-time post-hoc explanation via SHAP values and saliency maps. The library is lightweight, extensible, and installable via pip, and includes built-in metrics for constraint violations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on constrained variants of CartPole and provide visualizations that reveal both policy logic and safety adherence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator, facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability (thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2) information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive 20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection (99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains. AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17307">Learning to Adapt Frozen CLIP for Few-Shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixiang Chi, Li Gu, Huan Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Yanan Wu, Yang Wang, Konstantinos N Plataniotis</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP, solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16, performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP, this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for FMoW.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tamas Bisztray, Bilel Cherif, Richard A. Dubniczky, Nils Gruschka, Bertalan Borsos, Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Attila Kovacs, Vasileios Mavroeidis, Norbert Tihanyi</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5 encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3, Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant Google Colab scripts on GitHub: https://github.com/LLMauthorbench/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma Finn, T. Anderson Keller, Manos Theodosis, Demba E. Ba</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agnideep Aich, Md Monzur Murshed, Sameera Hewage, Amanda Mayeaux</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases, results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation, which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas as a statistical method in machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime A. Berkovich, Noah S. David, Markus J. Buehler</p>
<p>Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Long, Haopeng Wang, Haiwei Dong, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</p>
<p>Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wang, Hewei Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture, FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model. We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is 7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglin Lai, Mengyao Liao, Dong Xu, Zebin Zhao, Zhihang Yuan, Chao Fan, Jianqiang Li, Bingzhe Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES) algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set of experts on overall model safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Wu, Meitang Li, Jingcheng Yang, Jize Jiang, Kaizhuo Yan, Zhaoheng Li, Minjia Zhang, Klara Nahrstedt</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs), particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amitash Nanda, Sree Bhargavi Balija, Debashis Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs) approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks, using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on causes of highly and low interpretable features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen Schotth\"ofer, Timon Klein, Jonas Kusch</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape. To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger validation metrics at given parameter budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanyu Zhuang, Geoffroy Peeters, Ga\"el Richard</p>
<p>Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning (RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and generalizes well across different audio domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Madhusudan Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management, personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context, combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhang, Zi Wang, Hanwen Zhou, Zhaohong Deng, Weiping Ding, Yuxi Ge, Te Zhang, Yuanpeng Zhang, Kup-Sze Choi, Shitong Wang, Shudong Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible. In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed, considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views, and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained the best results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lakshita Dodeja, Karl Schmeckpeper, Shivam Vats, Thomas Weng, Mingxi Jia, George Konidaris, Stefanie Tellex</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods, and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17576">Towards Deeper GCNs: Alleviating Over-smoothing via Iterative Training and Fine-tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Furong Peng, Jinzhen Gao, Xuan Lu, Kang Liu, Yifan Huo, Sheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast, Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations, maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1) layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2) low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and (3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method, LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Wang, Biao Chen, Hairun Xie, Rui Wang, Yifan Xia, Jifa Zhang, Hui Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by 28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chicheng Zhang, Yihan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions, $\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness, and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of $\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and $\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$ in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly interpolates between realizable and agnostic regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Ahmed, Clemens Schaefer, Gil Tabak, Denis Vnukov, Zenong Zhang, Felix chern, Anatoliy Yevtushenko, Andy Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved, which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by 1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on quality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17620">Trustworthy Chronic Disease Risk Prediction For Self-Directed Preventive Care via Medical Literature Validation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Le, Khoi Ton</p>
<p>Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases. However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment. Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care. Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness. Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases, indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17621">Exploiting Efficiency Vulnerabilities in Dynamic Deep Learning Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravishka Rathnasuriya, Wei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency. While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency, resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zesen Wang, Yonggang Li, Lijuan Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manhin Poon, XiangXiang Dai, Xutong Liu, Fang Kong, John C. S. Lui, Jinhang Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution: the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction) extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17672">Learning Personalized Utility Functions for Drivers in Ride-hailing Systems Using Ensemble Hypernetworks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiming Mai, Jie Gao, Oded Cats</p>
<p>Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions, and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes. However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique, personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonglae Cho, Harryn Oh, Donghyun Lee, Luis Eduardo Rodrigues Vieira, Andrew Bermingham, Ziad El Sayed</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features. However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features, which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of SAE training datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research, particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to support low-resource research environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization (EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose \textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning (\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains. Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial, field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207 batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time. Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50% average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into the sustainable energy landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD) algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.</p>

A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model. It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks enables synergistic learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dyuman Aditya, Colton Payne, Mario Leiva, Paulo Shakarian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes. This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Cristian Nica, Akshaya Vishnu Kudlu Shanbhogue, Harshil Shah, Aleix Cambray, Tudor Berariu, Lucas Maystre, David Barber</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode (granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment. We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2% of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000 steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Romero, Shuoyang Ding, Corey D. Barret, Georgiana Dinu, George Karypis</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings. Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or number of active parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amber Hu, Henry Smith, Scott Linderman</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable, motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI). However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets, including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijun Zhang, Xiao Liu, Hui Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of this generative solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neta Shoham, Liron Mor-Yosef, Haim Avron</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongtian Sun, Anoushka Harit, Pietro Lio</p>
<p>Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity. Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics. Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT, PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinnan Zhang, Chenliang Li, Siliang Zeng, Jiaxiang Li, Zhongruo Wang, Kaixiang Lin, Songtao Lu, Alfredo Garcia, Mingyi Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible. In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions, and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anoushka Harit, Zhongtian Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse), and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under uncertainty in dynamic social environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Del Gobbo</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real, high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries: SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN, TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio. Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility, assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case. The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the 1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use, making it more accessible for practitioners.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17848">Pathway-based Progressive Inference (PaPI) for Energy-Efficient Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Suyash Gaurav, Jukka Heikkonen, Jatin Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$ is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size. Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning in energy-constrained settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Wurgaft, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Core Francisco Park, Hidenori Tanaka, Gautam Reddy, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions. We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies: beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased. Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhang Xie, Chuntao Ding, Xiaqing Li, Shenyuan Ren, Yidong Li, Zhichao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission, storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101 with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately 78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+ offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+ delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios. Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized predictive modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingfang Hu (Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, USA.), Ian A. Kash (Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, USA.)</p>
<p>Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the parametric space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiran Thorat, Amit Hasan, Caiwen Ding, Zhijie Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network (GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs. Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of 92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Mou, Miao Xu, Wei Chen, Rongquan Bai, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shulun Chen, Wei Shao, Flora D. Salim, Hao Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Bassetti, Luk\'a\v{s} Posp\'i\v{s}il, Michael Groom, Terence J. O'Kane, Illia Horenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training - a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariya Hendriksen, Tabish Rashid, David Bignell, Raluca Georgescu, Abdelhak Lemkhenter, Katja Hofmann, Sam Devlin, Sarah Parisot</p>
<p>Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjian Huang, Guiping Cao, Jiahao Xia, Jingkun Chen, Hao Wang, Jianguo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods, binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration. Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an efficient communication gradient compression algorithm designed for distributed training. LQ-SGD further develops on the basis of PowerSGD by incorporating the low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD, providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingting Zhu, Tingyang Chen, Yinghui Wu, Arijit Khan, Xiangyu Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees. Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations. Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Mattioli, Youness Ait Hadichou, Sabrina Chaouche, Martin Gonzalez</p>
<p>Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in out-of-distribution settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18007">Imputation of Longitudinal Data Using GANs: Challenges and Implications for Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharon Torao Pingi, Md Abul Bashar, Richi Nayak</p>
<p>Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data, characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions. Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to address LDC challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations. Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Boudou, Batiste Le Bars, Nirupam Gupta, Aur\'elien Bellet</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data. While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically, we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error, degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}} \big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhay Sheshadri, John Hughes, Julian Michael, Alex Mallen, Arun Jose,  Janus, Fabien Roger</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals. Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in alignment faking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their ``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability. Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and code are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TAB.</p>

This work explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system identification. Standard meta learning approaches optimize the expected loss, overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks, enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows to reduce failures in safety-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Hossein Amani, Aryo Lotfi, Nicolas Mario Baldwin, Samy Bengio, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Emmanuel Abbe, Robert West</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to partial solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoxiu Wei, Mingchao Liang, Florian Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so, the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved. To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhan, Liliang Ren, Shuohang Wang, Liyuan Liu, Yang Liu, Yeyun Gong, Yanzhi Wang, Yelong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However, efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers. At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM, including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static, frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed, uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention, due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited practical value.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process, or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling. Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the \textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Venhoff, Iv\'an Arcuschin, Philip Torr, Arthur Conmy, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghyun Lee, Yuhang Li, Ruokai Yin, Shiting Xiao, Priyadarshini Panda</p>
<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs. However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane (LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over existing PEFT methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Kamran Chowdhury Shisher, Vishrant Tripathi, Mung Chiang, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems, while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however, the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in non-stationary environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary for training supervised ML models. In this work, we study the use of the very recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance, particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across all tested datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Alice Yang, Jianyu Zhang, L\'eon Bottou</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically, present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards addressing this challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Wan, Wei Wang, Wenyue Xu, Wotao Yin, Jie Song, Mingyang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models' evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically, AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Li, Chuan Wang, Hongdong Zhu, Qi Gao, Yin Ma, Hai Wei, Kai Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Li, Long Liu, Yihang Hu, Hu Chen, Shifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers. However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning, i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student, we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manaswin Oddiraju, Bharath Varma Penumatsa, Divyang Amin, Michael Piedmonte, Souma Chowdhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However, their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover, Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yu, Bo Ji, Shouli Wang, Shu Yao, Zefan Wang, Ganqu Cui, Lifan Yuan, Ning Ding, Yuan Yao, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama, and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6 points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points across seven benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Tang, Peter A. Torrione, Cihat Eldeniz, Leslie M. Collins</p>
<p>Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data. The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved performance for the landmine detection problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haseeb Ullah Khan Shinwari, Muhammad Usama</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$ sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32% trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA. Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for efficient foundation model adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naiyu Yin, Tian Gao, Yue Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research, leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG (ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs. By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable down-stream applications in causal discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhang, Jinghong Mao, Shangwen Zhu, Zhantao Yang, Lianghua Huang, Yu Liu, Deli Zhao, Ruili Feng, Fan Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed, which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability, that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency, particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing physical principles of ray-surface interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchao Fan, Xuyang Lei, Xiaolin Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks, yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixin Wu, Na Cai, Qiao Cheng, Jiachen Wang, Yitao Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Confucius3-Math, an open-source large language model with 14B parameters that (1) runs efficiently on a single consumer-grade GPU; (2) achieves SOTA performances on a range of mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming many models with significantly larger sizes. In particular, as part of our mission to enhancing education and knowledge dissemination with AI, Confucius3-Math is specifically committed to mathematics learning for Chinese K-12 students and educators. Built via post-training with large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), Confucius3-Math aligns with national curriculum and excels at solving main-stream Chinese K-12 mathematical problems with low cost. In this report we share our development recipe, the challenges we encounter and the techniques we develop to overcome them. In particular, we introduce three technical innovations: Targeted Entropy Regularization, Recent Sample Recovery and Policy-Specific Hardness Weighting. These innovations encompass a new entropy regularization, a novel data scheduling policy, and an improved group-relative advantage estimator. Collectively, they significantly stabilize the RL training, improve data efficiency, and boost performance. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of building strong reasoning models in a particular domain at low cost. We open-source our model and code at https://github.com/netease-youdao/Confucius3-Math.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Kiran Bacsa, Loon Ching Tang, Eleni Chatzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior, achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Floor Eijkelboom, Heiko Zimmermann, Sharvaree Vadgama, Erik J Bekkers, Max Welling, Christian A. Naesseth, Jan-Willem van de Meent</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichong Li, Chen Liang, Zixuan Zhang, Ilgee Hong, Young Jin Kim, Weizhu Chen, Tuo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE (3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE architectures. We make our models publicly available at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-mini-MoE-instruct and https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-tiny-MoE-instruct .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koushik Viswanadha, Deepanway Ghosal, Somak Aditya</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14% less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics, we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by better representing them in their logical formulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Aruta, Ciro Listone, Giuseppe Murano, Aniello Murano</p>
<p>Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of 0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network, enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominique Mercier, Andreas Dengel,  Sheraz,  Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either filtered or the relevant input data is marked.</p>

<p>Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniss Bessalah, Hatem Mohamed Abdelmoumen, Karima Benatchba, Hadjer Benmeziane</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this, we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandra Agostini, Andrea Maurino, Blerina Spahiu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types, including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification, duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chang, Kuang-Da Wang, Ping-Chun Hsieh, Cheng-Kuan Lin, Wen-Chih Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs. ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points, which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT (Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer), a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior. Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$ for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan G. Rittig, Clemens Kortmann</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos, hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering. Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for future industrial applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences, allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'ois\'in Luo, James McDermott, Christian Gagn\'e, Qiang Sun, Colm O'Riordan</p>
<p>Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows, induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii) the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviral Gupta, Armaan Sethi, Ameesh Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations. These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap, training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap, inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengjian Hua, Eric Vanden-Eijnden, Ricky T. Q. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control, with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal dynamics from population data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective, comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding symmetry-aware model selection.</p>

Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyin Xia, Yifan Wang, Lifeng Shen, Guoyin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally, the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises. Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical evaluation of various clustering tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18640">Federated Loss Exploration for Improved Convergence on Non-IID Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Intern\`o, Markus Olhofer, Yaochu Jin, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration (FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters. This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome critical barriers in diverse FL applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Hanneke, Amin Karbasi, Anay Mehrotra, Grigoris Velegkas</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025]. While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions (uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in the growing area of language generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchang Zhu, Jintang Li, Huizhe Zhang, Liang Chen, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives: topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZzoomD/SaGIF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Li, Shifei Ding, Lili Guo, Xuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation (MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Kolawole, Keshav Santhanam, Virginia Smith, Pratiksha Thaker</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuning Yang, Han Yu, Tianrun Gao, Xiaodong Xu, Guangyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL) enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building trustworthy and fair FFM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debanjan Dutta, Faizanuddin Ansari, Anish Chakrabarty, Swagatam Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems \emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator $\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be approximated only by learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Feng, Samuel Dalton, Benjamin Letham, Maximilian Balandat, Eytan Bakshy</p>
<p>Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.</p>

Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Bahr, Lucas Po{\ss}ner, Konstantin Weise, Sophie Gr\"oger, R\"udiger Daub</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification model used in BMW Group production facilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Csaba Zsolnai, Niels L\"orch, Julian Arnold</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions, where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content, making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Atul Bhope, K. R. Jayaram, Praveen Venkateswaran, Nalini Venkatasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin An, Ruijie Li, Qiao Ning, Shikai Guo, Hui Li, Qian Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial Learning method between the association network view and different similarity views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in predicting potential drug-microbe associations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances. In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.</p>

While manually defining such expressions is intricate, there already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further improvements required.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadley Black, Arya Mazumdar, Barna Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$ elements into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information about a small subset of elements. Our starting point is the well-studied pairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same class. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$ queries, while adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the last two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and relevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many applications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing query complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic query complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$, interpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant $r$, the query complexity is $\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs $O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.
  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show $\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that there is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally, we obtain nearly matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using subset queries in terms of both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hydrogen's role is growing as an energy carrier, increasing the need for efficient production, with methane steam reforming being the most widely used technique. This process is crucial for applications like fuel cells, where hydrogen is converted into electricity, pushing for reactor miniaturization and optimized process control through numerical simulations.

An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes experimental data from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, interpolated data, and theoretical data derived from theoretical models for each regime. Data augmentation and assigning appropriate weights to each data type enhanced training. After evaluating Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling, the optimal model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the composition of the post-reaction mixture under varying operating parameters, indicated by a mean squared error of 0.000498 and strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.927. The network's ability to provide continuous derivatives of its predictions makes it particularly useful for process modeling and optimization. The results confirm the surrogate model's robustness for simulating methane steam reforming in both kinetic and equilibrium regimes, making it a valuable tool for design and process optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenric P. Nelson</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes, a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to $p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE); however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables $(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems, $q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reese E. Jones, Adrian Buganza Tepole, Jan N. Fuhg</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes. This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for gradient-based learning and inference.
  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression, enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability, making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and physical simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Scarbro, Calum Imrie, Sinem Getir Yaman, Kavan Fatehi, Corina S. Pasareanu, Radu Calinescu, Ravi Mangal</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinaik Chhetri, Yousaf Reza, Moghis Fereidouni, Srijata Maji, Umar Farooq, AB Siddique</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern recommendation systems typically follow two complementary paradigms: collaborative filtering, which models long-term user preferences from historical interactions, and conversational recommendation systems (CRS), which interact with users in natural language to uncover immediate needs. Each captures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack collaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions, traditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate needs. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in real user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in timestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a three-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles and community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2) Semantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of flexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the plan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by executional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three domains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K multi-turn dialogs per dataset. Human and automatic evaluations confirm the naturalness, coherence, and behavioral grounding of the generated conversations. To demonstrate utility, we build a cross-attention transformer model that jointly encodes user history and dialog context, achieving gains in Hit@K and NDCG@K over baselines using either signal alone or naive fusion. Notably, our model achieves a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp over the strongest baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Raja, Arpita Vats</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

<p>Abstract: We present Mercury, a new generation of commercial-scale large language models (LLMs) based on diffusion. These models are parameterized via the Transformer architecture and trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel. In this report, we detail Mercury Coder, our first set of diffusion LLMs designed for coding applications. Currently, Mercury Coder comes in two sizes: Mini and Small. These models set a new state-of-the-art on the speed-quality frontier. Based on independent evaluations conducted by Artificial Analysis, Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small achieve state-of-the-art throughputs of 1109 tokens/sec and 737 tokens/sec, respectively, on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and outperform speed-optimized frontier models by up to 10x on average while maintaining comparable quality. We discuss additional results on a variety of code benchmarks spanning multiple languages and use-cases as well as real-world validation by developers on Copilot Arena, where the model currently ranks second on quality and is the fastest model overall.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyi Lin, Anshuman Suri, Alina Oprea, Cheng Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal patterns, (2) breadth-first sampling to identify easily accessible jailbreaks, and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized comparison of red team attacks, and model certification under extreme adversarial conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel T. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect (ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves "imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts. Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual counterfactuals (non-actual).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Lin, Theresa Chen, Colby Brungard, Grunwald Sabine, Sue Ives, Matt Macander, Timm Nawrocki, Yao-Yi Chiang, Nic Jelinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes. These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17309">Efficient Malware Detection with Optimized Learning on High-Dimensional Features</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Choudhary, Sarthak Pawar, Yashodhara Haribhakta</p>
<p>Abstract: Malware detection using machine learning requires feature extraction from binary files, as models cannot process raw binaries directly. A common approach involves using LIEF for raw feature extraction and the EMBER vectorizer to generate 2381-dimensional feature vectors. However, the high dimensionality of these features introduces significant computational challenges. This study addresses these challenges by applying two dimensionality reduction techniques: XGBoost-based feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We evaluate three reduced feature dimensions (128, 256, and 384), which correspond to approximately 5.4%, 10.8%, and 16.1% of the original 2381 features, across four models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, and Random Forest-using a unified training, validation, and testing split formed from the EMBER-2018, ERMDS, and BODMAS datasets. This approach ensures generalization and avoids dataset bias. Experimental results show that LightGBM trained on the 384-dimensional feature set after XGBoost feature selection achieves the highest accuracy of 97.52% on the unified dataset, providing an optimal balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. The best model, trained in 61 minutes using 30 GB of RAM and 19.5 GB of disk space, generalizes effectively to completely unseen datasets, maintaining 95.31% accuracy on TRITIUM and 93.98% accuracy on INFERNO. These findings present a scalable, compute-efficient approach for malware detection without compromising accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Liu, Pengfei Jiao, Mengzhou Gao, Chaochao Chen, Di Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric, the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes. However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we apply machine learning and software engineering in analyzing air pollution levels in City of Baltimore. The data model was fed with three primary data sources: 1) a biased method of estimating insurance risk used by homeowners loan corporation, 2) demographics of Baltimore residents, and 3) census data estimate of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The dataset covers 650,643 Baltimore residents in 44.7 million residents in 202 major cities in US. The results show that air pollution levels have a clear association with the biased insurance estimating method. Great disparities present in NO2 level between more desirable and low income blocks. Similar disparities exist in air pollution level between residents' ethnicity. As Baltimore population consists of a greater proportion of people of color, the finding reveals how decades old policies has continued to discriminate and affect quality of life of Baltimore citizens today.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations, short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies. MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changwen Xu, Shang Zhu, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan</p>
<p>Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability. Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures, CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for property prediction and materials discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content reconstruction.</p>

They are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration, distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are developed in parallel by the two research communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quoc Thinh Vo, Joe Woods, Priontu Chowdhury, David K. Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater sound localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhao Duan, James Diffenderfer, Sandeep Madireddy, Tianlong Chen, Bhavya Kailkhura, Kaidi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios, e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g., AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp, including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaus Salvatore, Qiong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Past work has long recognized the important role of context in guiding how humans search their memory. While context-based memory models can explain many memory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over possible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that foundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention -- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural machine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their convergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the functional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to model human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine translation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both interpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show that our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns as effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate additional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search performance emerges from the interaction of different model components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Guan, David Bates, Li Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality. These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the "health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society. This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions. First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs' capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback, particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Ravichandran, Ignacio Hounie, Fernando Cladera, Alejandro Ribeiro, George J. Pappas, Vijay Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We release all software, trained models, and datasets at https://zacravichandran.github.io/PRISM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei-An Hsieh, Kong Yao Chee, M. Ani Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an accurate dynamics model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Yao, Ke Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite progress in controllable symbolic music generation, data scarcity remains a challenge for certain control modalities. Composer-style music generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available, limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g., melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yile Gu, Rohan Kadekodi, Hoang Nguyen, Keisuke Kamahori, Yiyu Liu, Baris Kasikci</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent shift in Generative AI (GenAI) applications from cloud-only environments to end-user devices introduces new challenges in resource management, system efficiency, and user experience. This paper presents ConsumerBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the system efficiency and response time of GenAI models running on end-user devices. Unlike existing benchmarks that assume exclusive model access on dedicated GPUs, ConsumerBench simulates realistic multi-application scenarios executing concurrently on constrained hardware. Furthermore, ConsumerBench supports customizable workflows that simulate complex tasks requiring coordination among multiple applications. ConsumerBench captures both application-level metrics, including latency and Service Level Objective (SLO) attainment, and system-level metrics like CPU/GPU utilization and memory bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, ConsumerBench reveals inefficiencies in resource sharing, unfair scheduling under greedy allocation, and performance pitfalls of static model server configurations. The paper also provides practical insights for model developers and system designers, highlighting the benefits of custom kernels tailored to consumer-grade GPU architectures and the value of implementing SLO-aware scheduling strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingting Liu, Yuan Liu, Jinhui Tang, Liyin Yuan, Chengyu Liu, Chunlai Li, Xiubao Sui, Qian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging, are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze. However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC, progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Garg, Micha{\l} Derezi\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method, thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies, often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive biases for computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Xia, Robin Schmucker, Conrad Borchers, Vincent Aleven</p>
<p>Abstract: Mastery learning improves learning proficiency and efficiency. However, the overpractice of skills--students spending time on skills they have already mastered--remains a fundamental challenge for tutoring systems. Previous research has reduced overpractice through the development of better problem selection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few efforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level adaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose and evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem selection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models and problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding can reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to complete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered. Fast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection algorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that preferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that while Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its practical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and engaged at higher levels of difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Jian Pei, Manzil Zaheer, Bhuwan Dhingra</p>
<p>Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual) pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks. Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent. Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the original token count.</p>

<p>Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, they are still prone to hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Csaba T\'oth</p>
<p>Abstract: The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling - common challenges in real-world time series and graph data.
  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency, bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling; the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context length.
  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\% improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using LLMs.The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/samwu-learn/Step.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit, such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabien Furfaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans), a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA). It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance, Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is available at https://github.com/fabienfrfr/tptt .

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhe Ding, Kang He, Bobo Li, Li Zheng, Haijun He, Fei Li, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%, highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models (LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution, spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts, spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudh Kalyan, Sundararajan Natarajan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, the physics informed neural networks (PINNs) is employed for the numerical simulation of heat transfer involving a moving source. To reduce the computational effort, a new training method is proposed that uses a continuous time-stepping through transfer learning. Within this, the time interval is divided into smaller intervals and a single network is initialized. On this single network each time interval is trained with the initial condition for (n+1)th as the solution obtained at nth time increment. Thus, this framework enables the computation of large temporal intervals without increasing the complexity of the network itself. The proposed framework is used to estimate the temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium with a moving heat source. The results from the proposed framework is compared with traditional finite element method and a good agreement is seen.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Han, Zeyi Liu, Shijin Chen, Dongliang Zou, Xiao He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and presents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The discrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions degrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied to others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has been introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing multi-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization approaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault features. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific multi-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact on fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the model to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall generalization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing end-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically in variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a real-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed, aiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant operating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with a retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant fault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the source domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulrahman Al-Fakih, Ardiansyah Koeshidayatullah, Nabil A. Saraih, Tapan Mukerji, Rayan Kanfar, Abdulmohsen Alali, SanLinn I. Kaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies, porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over 19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74, FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA 0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling (Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bal\'azs Csan\'ad Cs\'aji, B\'alint Horv\'ath</p>
<p>Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsuan-Po Liu, Hessam Mahdavifar</p>
<p>Abstract: A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale, privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at https://camp-lab-purdue.github.io/bayesian-social-deduction/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Kamrul Hossain, Walid Aljoby, Anis Elgabli, Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem, Khaled A. Harras</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without exposing clients' data. While clients only share model updates with the aggregator, studies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these updates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during transmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where adversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections, constituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random selection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL performance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which simultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and robust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL implements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The first framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual trust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework handles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them. For the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1) enforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a cluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to prioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a two-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients based on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF) ensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to reduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve energy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\times$ faster time-to-accuracy and up to $1.06\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in music foundation models have improved audio representation learning, yet their effectiveness across diverse musical traditions remains limited. We introduce CultureMERT-95M, a multi-culturally adapted foundation model developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and understanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training strategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling stable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a 650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music traditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across diverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior state-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We further investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural adaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task arithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on non-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets. Cross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with varying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally adapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on world music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and CultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap, often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may be beneficial to the marine robotics community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler Cultice, Md. Saif Hassan Onim, Annarita Giani, Himanshu Thapliyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Sensitive data captured by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a large role in the safety and integrity of many critical infrastructures. Detection of anomalous or malicious data, or Anomaly Detection (AD), with machine learning is one of many vital components of cyberphysical security. Quantum kernel-based machine learning methods have shown promise in identifying complex anomalous behavior by leveraging the highly expressive and efficient feature spaces of quantum computing. This study focuses on the parameterization of Quantum Hybrid Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) using three popular datasets from Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The results demonstrate that QSVMs outperform traditional classical kernel methods, achieving 13.3% higher F1 scores. Additionally, this research investigates noise using simulations based on real IBMQ hardware, revealing a maximum error of only 0.98% in the QSVM kernels. This error results in an average reduction of 1.57% in classification metrics. Furthermore, the study found that QSVMs show a 91.023% improvement in kernel-target alignment compared to classical methods, indicating a potential "quantum advantage" in anomaly detection for critical infrastructures. This effort suggests that QSVMs can provide a substantial advantage in anomaly detection for ICS, ultimately enhancing the security and integrity of critical infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Kunapuli, Jake Welde, Dinesh Jayaraman, Vijay Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information, describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC, but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required. Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fahad Mostafa, Md Rejuan Haque, Md Mostafijur Rahman, Farzana Nasrin</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter estimation is a foundational step in statistical modeling, enabling us to extract knowledge from data and apply it effectively. Bayesian estimation of parameters incorporates prior beliefs with observed data to infer distribution parameters probabilistically and robustly. Moreover, it provides full posterior distributions, allowing uncertainty quantification and regularization, especially useful in small or truncated samples. Utilizing the left-truncated log-logistic (LTLL) distribution is particularly well-suited for modeling time-to-event data where observations are subject to a known lower bound such as precipitation data and cancer survival times. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the LTLL distribution with a fixed truncation point \( x_L > 0 \). Given a random variable \( X \sim LL(\alpha, \beta; x_L) \), where \( \alpha > 0 \) is the scale parameter and \( \beta > 0 \) is the shape parameter, the likelihood function is derived based on a truncated sample \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N \) with \( X_i > x_L \). We assume independent prior distributions for the parameters, and the posterior inference is conducted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, specifically using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain posterior estimates \( \hat{\alpha} \) and \( \hat{\beta} \). Through simulation studies and real-world applications, we demonstrate that Bayesian estimation provides more stable and reliable parameter estimates, particularly when the likelihood surface is irregular due to left truncation. The results highlight the advantages of Bayesian inference outperform the estimation of parameter uncertainty in truncated distributions for time to event data analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunan Liu, Aurelien Pelissier, Yanjun Shao, Lilian Denzler, Andrew C. R. Martin, Brooks Paige, Mariia Rodriguez Martinez</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions, and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary, AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable, structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer. This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs) often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic (lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered away from diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Hu, Debarghya Mukherjee, Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world applications, ensuring the robustness and stability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial, particularly for image classification tasks that encounter various input perturbations. While data augmentation techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related to the W-DRO problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trong-An Bui, Thanh-Thoai Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud contamination significantly impairs the usability of optical satellite imagery, affecting critical applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and land-use analysis. This research presents a Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework that integrates SAR-optical feature fusion with deep learning-based image reconstruction to generate cloud-free optical imagery. The proposed framework employs an attention-driven feature fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data. Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of 0.017. These outcomes highlight the framework's effectiveness in producing high-fidelity, spatially and spectrally consistent cloud-free optical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianghong Huang, Luping Ji, Xin Ma, Mao Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry, widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks. Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However, existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyu Wang, Zhiqiang Hu, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish" can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the "gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Kant Gupta, Shounak Das, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features. Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Trinh, Andreas Ren\'e Geist, Josefine Monnet, Stefan Vilceanu, Sebastian Trimpe, Christian Brecher</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.</p>

In this technical report, we present a fast and reliable neural inverse kinematics framework designed for real-time capture of human body motions from 3D keypoints. We describe the network architecture, training methodology, and inference procedure in detail. Our framework is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, and we support key design decisions through ablation studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric regression method that models complex input-output relationships as the sum of convex and concave components. The method-Identifiable Convex-Concave Nonparametric Least Squares (ICCNLS)-decomposes the target function into additive shape-constrained components, each represented via sub-gradient-constrained affine functions. To address the affine ambiguity inherent in convex-concave decompositions, we introduce global statistical orthogonality constraints, ensuring that residuals are uncorrelated with both intercept and input variables. This enforces decomposition identifiability and improves interpretability. We further incorporate L1, L2 and elastic net regularisation on sub-gradients to enhance generalisation and promote structural sparsity. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, including healthcare pricing data, and demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and model simplicity compared to conventional CNLS and difference-of-convex (DC) regression approaches. Our results show that statistical identifiability, when paired with convex-concave structure and sub-gradient regularisation, yields interpretable models suited for forecasting, benchmarking, and policy evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shu Yu Tew, Daniel F. Schmidt, Mario Boley</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GRASP, a simple Bayesian framework for regression with grouped predictors, built on the normal beta prime (NBP) prior. The NBP prior is an adaptive generalization of the horseshoe prior with tunable hyperparameters that control tail behavior, enabling a flexible range of sparsity, from strong shrinkage to ridge-like regularization. Unlike prior work that introduced the group inverse-gamma gamma (GIGG) prior by decomposing the NBP prior into structured hierarchies, we show that directly controlling the tails is sufficient without requiring complex hierarchical constructions. Extending the non-tail adaptive grouped half-Cauchy hierarchy of Xu et al., GRASP assigns the NBP prior to both local and group shrinkage parameters allowing adaptive sparsity within and across groups. A key contribution of this work is a novel framework to explicitly quantify correlations among shrinkage parameters within a group, providing deeper insights into grouped shrinkage behavior. We also introduce an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampler for hyperparameter estimation. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the robustness and versatility of GRASP across grouped regression problems with varying sparsity and signal-to-noise ratios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and 46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities. Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor, Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably, it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8 A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Idan Simai, Ronen Talmon, Uri Shaham</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine learning model for diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers, including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning modeling algorithms were implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a training AUC of 1.00 and a testing AUC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. DCA indicated a higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies, suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable machine learning model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Noroozizadeh, Pim Welle, Jeremy C. Weiss, George H. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner, nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for causal interpretation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masudul Hasan Masud Bhuiyan, Gianluca De Stefano, Giancarlo Pellegrino, Cristian-Alexandru Staicu</p>
<p>Abstract: Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues. A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features, existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges (150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases, reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Yilmaz, Aniruddh Aiyengar</p>
<p>Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal disorders in under-resourced areas.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms. Utilizing \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) we develop a generic program that allows statistical characterization of various algorithmic performance metrics. Through these we identify the concepts of \emph{parametric manifold} and its \emph{funneling points} as key mathematical objects that govern the underlying algorithms' behavior. An isomorphism between single funneling point manifolds and global convergence of descending algorithms is established. The structure and shape of the parametric manifold as well as its dependence on the sample complexity are studied through both plain and lifted RDT. Emergence of a phase transition is observed. Namely, as sample complexity increases, parametric manifold transitions from a multi to a single funneling point structure. This in return corresponds to a transition from the scenarios where descending algorithms generically fail to the scenarios where they succeed in solving phase retrieval. We also develop and implement a practical algorithmic variant that in a hybrid alternating fashion combines a barrier and a plain gradient descent. Even though the theoretical results are obtained for infinite dimensional scenarios (and consequently non-jittery parametric manifolds), we observe a strong agrement between theoretical and simulated phase transitions predictions for fairly small dimensions on the order of a few hundreds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihailo Stojnic</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze the relation between spectral initializers and theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR). In companion paper [104], for any sample complexity ratio, $\alpha$, \emph{parametric manifold}, ${\mathcal {PM}}(\alpha)$, is recognized as a critically important structure that generically determines dPRs abilities to solve phase retrieval (PR). Moreover, overlap between the algorithmic solution and the true signal is positioned as a key ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s component. We here consider the so-called \emph{overlap optimal} spectral initializers (OptSpins) as dPR's starting points and develop a generic \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based program to statistically characterize them. In particular, we determine the functional structure of OptSpins and evaluate the starting overlaps that they provide for the dPRs. Since ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s so-called \emph{flat regions} are highly susceptible to \emph{local jitteriness} and as such are key obstacles on dPR's path towards PR's global optimum, a precise characterization of the starting overlap allows to determine if such regions can be successfully circumvented. Through the presented theoretical analysis we observe two key points in that regard: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} dPR's theoretical phase transition (critical $\alpha$ above which they solve PR) might be difficult to practically achieve as the ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s flat regions are large causing the associated OptSpins to fall exactly within them; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} Opting for so-called ``\emph{safer compression}'' and slightly increasing $\alpha$ (by say $15\%$) shrinks flat regions and allows OptSpins to fall outside them and dPRs to ultimately solve PR. Numerical simulations are conducted as well and shown to be in an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mihailo Stojnic</p>
<p>Abstract: Companion paper [118] developed a powerful \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based analytical program to statistically characterize performance of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR) (these include all variants of gradient descents and among them widely popular Wirtinger flows). We here generalize the program and show how it can be utilized to handle rank $d$ positive definite phase retrieval (PR) measurements (with special cases $d=1$ and $d=2$ serving as emulations of the real and complex phase retrievals, respectively). In particular, we observe that the minimal sample complexity ratio (number of measurements scaled by the dimension of the unknown signal) which ensures dPR's success exhibits a phase transition (PT) phenomenon. For both plain and lifted RDT we determine phase transitions locations. To complement theoretical results we implement a log barrier gradient descent variant and observe that, even in small dimensional scenarios (with problem sizes on the order of 100), the simulated phase transitions are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuli Slavutsky, David M. Blei</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks make accurate predictions but often fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, especially under covariate distribution shifts between training and testing. To address this problem, we propose a Bayesian framework for uncertainty estimation that explicitly accounts for covariate shifts. While conventional approaches rely on fixed priors, the key idea of our method is an adaptive prior, conditioned on both training and new covariates. This prior naturally increases uncertainty for inputs that lie far from the training distribution in regions where predictive performance is likely to degrade. To efficiently approximate the resulting posterior predictive distribution, we employ amortized variational inference. Finally, we construct synthetic environments by drawing small bootstrap samples from the training data, simulating a range of plausible covariate shift using only the original dataset. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data. It yields substantially improved uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moein Khajehnejad, Forough Habibollahi, Adeel Razi</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Yang, Chung Peng Lee, Shangbin Feng, Dora Zhao, Bingbing Wen, Anthony Z. Liu, Yulia Tsvetkov, Bill Howe</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of 124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets, each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364 multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to 78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to the overall image context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Caspari, Thomas Bierweiler, Sarah Fadda, Daniel Labisch, Maarten Nauta, Franzisko Wagner, Merle Warmbold, Constantinos C. Pantelides</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models, which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1) regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotong Du, Yaqing Wang, Fei Xiong, Lei Shao, Ming Liu, Hao Gu, Quanming Yao, Zhen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms, multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance costs and alleviate data sparsity. The key to effective multi-scenario recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However, existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users' behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng He, Zhenyang Liu, Marco Valentino, Zhixue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa, the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies, emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and alignment properties.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18440">New Hardness Results for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dror Chawin, Ishay Haviv</p>
<p>Abstract: The low-rank matrix completion problem asks whether a given real matrix with missing values can be completed so that the resulting matrix has low rank or is close to a low-rank matrix. The completed matrix is often required to satisfy additional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a bounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad real-world applications.
  This paper presents new $\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix completion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and any real number $\varepsilon \in [ 2^{-O(d)},\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial matrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive semi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a positive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an additive error of at most $\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to exceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2 \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra, and Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than $2$ and to $\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is constrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive semi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity assumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel notion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line digraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Romero, Gianluca Baldassarre, Richard J. Duro, Vieri Giuliano Santucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks, and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the various challenges of open-ended learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atifa Kalsoom, M. A. Iftikhar, Amjad Ali, Zubair Shah, Shidin Balakrishnan, Hazrat Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness. In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE images, confirming its generalization ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> So Yeon Kim, Yang Jeong Park, Ju Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a hybridization approach, by ``hacking" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including \textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize high-performance predictive modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural estimators are simulation-based estimators for the parameters of a family of statistical models, which build a direct mapping from the sample to the parameter vector. They benefit from the versatility of available network architectures and efficient training methods developed in the field of deep learning. Neural estimators are amortized in the sense that, once trained, they can be applied to any new data set with almost no computational cost. While many papers have shown very good performance of these methods in simulation studies and real-world applications, so far no statistical guarantees are available to support these observations theoretically. In this work, we study the risk of neural estimators by decomposing it into several terms that can be analyzed separately. We formulate easy-to-check assumptions ensuring that each term converges to zero, and we verify them for popular applications of neural estimators. Our results provide a general recipe to derive theoretical guarantees also for broader classes of architectures and estimation problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Li, Wei Wu, Zhi Gao, Xiaomeng Fan, Peilin Yu, Yuwei Wu, Zhipeng Lu, Yunde Jia, Mehrtash Harandi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic \underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure (HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets. To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies, transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system, additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated. Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors. Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I) corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mauricio Byrd Victorica, Gy\"orgy D\'an, Henrik Sandberg</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused, implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors, SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection and the case of image classification, respectively.

This is done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model. Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Probabilistic models are often used to make predictions in regions of the data space where no observations are available, but it is not always clear whether such predictions are well-informed by previously seen data. In this paper, we propose a knowledge score for predictions from Gaussian process regression (GPR) models that quantifies the extent to which observing data have reduced our uncertainty about a prediction. The knowledge score is interpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1. We demonstrate in several experiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR model are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks such as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation.

Understanding SGD's generalization properties is crucial for ensuring robust model performance on unseen data. In this paper, we analyze the generalization error bounds of SGD for non-convex learning by introducing the Type II perturbed SGD (T2pm-SGD), which accommodates both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions. The generalization error bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the flatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$, significantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses, where n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting an optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further refined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory term is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across iterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which increase with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter generalization error bounds for both loss function types. Our theoretical results are validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of T2pm-SGD in establishing tighter generalization bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Liao, Jiaqing Liu, TianQi Hou, Difan Zou, Zenan Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized machine learning (ML) by enabling efficient modeling of global dependencies across inputs. Their inherently parallelizable structures allow for efficient scaling with the exponentially increasing size of both pretrained data and model parameters. Yet, despite their central role as the computational backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), the theoretical understanding of Attentions, especially in the nonlinear setting, remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the \emph{in-context memorization error} of \emph{nonlinear Attention}, in the high-dimensional proportional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and their embedding dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Leveraging recent advances in the theory of large kernel random matrices, we show that nonlinear Attention typically incurs higher memorization error than linear ridge regression on random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the input exhibits statistical structure, particularly when the Attention weights align with the input signal direction. Our results reveal how nonlinearity and input structure interact with each other to govern the memorization performance of nonlinear Attention. The theoretical insights are supported by numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Huber, Alexander Waibel</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g., byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to 11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dustin Aganian, Erik Franze, Markus Eisenbach, Horst-Michael Gross</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0 to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yigit Berkay Uslu, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Mark Eisen, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks, where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality gaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Shen, Shiyu Wang, Arnaud Lamy, Mariam Avagyan, John Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional data are ubiquitous, with examples ranging from natural images to scientific datasets, and often reside near low-dimensional manifolds. Leveraging this geometric structure is vital for downstream tasks, including signal denoising, reconstruction, and generation. However, in practice, the manifold is typically unknown and only noisy samples are available. A fundamental approach to uncovering the manifold structure is local averaging, which is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art provable methods for manifold fitting and denoising. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no works that rigorously analyze the accuracy of local averaging in a manifold setting in high-noise regimes. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses of a two-round mini-batch local averaging method applied to noisy samples drawn from a $d$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$, under a relatively high-noise regime where the noise size is comparable to the reach $\tau$. We show that with high probability, the averaged point $\hat{\mathbf q}$ achieves the bound $d(\hat{\mathbf q}, \mathcal M) \leq \sigma \sqrt{d\left(1+\frac{\kappa\mathrm{diam}(\mathcal {M})}{\log(D)}\right)}$, where $\sigma, \mathrm{diam(\mathcal M)},\kappa$ denote the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise, manifold's diameter and a bound on its extrinsic curvature, respectively. This is the first analysis of local averaging accuracy over the manifold in the relatively high noise regime where $\sigma \sqrt{D} \approx \tau$. The proposed method can serve as a preprocessing step for a wide range of provable methods designed for lower-noise regimes. Additionally, our framework can provide a theoretical foundation for a broad spectrum of denoising and dimensionality reduction methods that rely on local averaging techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Cort\'es Castillo, Wolfgang Dahmen, Jay Gopalakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop, analyze, and experimentally explore residual-based loss functions for machine learning of parameter-to-solution maps in the context of parameter-dependent families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our primary concern is on rigorous accuracy certification to enhance prediction capability of resulting deep neural network reduced models. This is achieved by the use of variationally correct loss functions. Through one specific example of an elliptic PDE, details for establishing the variational correctness of a loss function from an ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) discretization are worked out. Despite the focus on the example, the proposed concepts apply to a much wider scope of problems, namely problems for which stable DPG formulations are available. The issue of {high-contrast} diffusion fields and ensuing difficulties with degrading ellipticity are discussed. Both numerical results and theoretical arguments illustrate that for high-contrast diffusion parameters the proposed DPG loss functions deliver much more robust performance than simpler least-squares losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Cook, Silvia Sapora, Arash Ahmadian, Akbir Khan, Tim Rocktaschel, Jakob Foerster, Laura Ruis</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suyash Gaurav, Muhammad Farhan Humayun, Jukka Heikkonen, Jatin Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aristotelis Papatheodorou, Pranav Vaidhyanathan, Natalia Ares, Ioannis Havoutis</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles, into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs), the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures, restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet) to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models, grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wu, Yushi Bai, Zhiqiang Hu, Roy Ka-Wei Lee, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on ''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B, consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3-235B.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a new dataset and algorithm for fast and efficient coastal distance calculations from Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Existing global coastal datasets are only available at coarse resolution (e.g. 1-4 km) which limits their utility. Publicly available satellite imagery combined with computer vision enable much higher precision. We provide a global coastline dataset at 10 meter resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data. To handle the computational challenge of querying at such an increased scale, we introduce a new library: Layered Iterative Geospatial Hierarchical Terrain-Oriented Unified Search Engine (Lighthouse). Lighthouse is both exceptionally fast and resource-efficient, requiring only 1 CPU and 2 GB of RAM to achieve millisecond online inference, making it well suited for real-time applications in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vansh Sharma, Venkat Raman</p>
<p>Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models (LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed: per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for concept-level control for practical agentic systems.</p>

In this work, we aim to close the gap between theory and practice by showing that stochastic heavy ball momentum retains the fast linear rate of (deterministic) heavy ball momentum on quadratic optimization problems, at least when minibatching with a sufficiently large batch size. The algorithm we study can be interpreted as an accelerated randomized Kaczmarz algorithm with minibatching and heavy ball momentum. The analysis relies on carefully decomposing the momentum transition matrix, and using new spectral norm concentration bounds for products of independent random matrices. We provide numerical illustrations demonstrating that our bounds are reasonably sharp.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate time series forecasting is crucial for optimizing resource allocation, industrial production, and urban management, particularly with the growth of cyber-physical and IoT systems. However, limited training sample availability in fields like physics and biology poses significant challenges. Existing models struggle to capture long-term dependencies and to model diverse meta-knowledge explicitly in few-shot scenarios. To address these issues, we propose MetaGP, a meta-learning-based Gaussian process latent variable model that uses a Gaussian process kernel function to capture long-term dependencies and to maintain strong correlations in time series. We also introduce Kernel Association Search (KAS) as a novel meta-learning component to explicitly model meta-knowledge, thereby enhancing both interpretability and prediction accuracy. We study MetaGP on simulated and real-world few-shot datasets, showing that it is capable of state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. We also find that MetaGP can capture long-term dependencies and can model meta-knowledge, thereby providing valuable insights into complex time series patterns.</p>

Both the Indeterminate Probability Neural Network (IPNN) model and the non-neural multivariate time series forecasting application demonstrate IPT's effectiveness in modeling high-dimensional distributions, with successful validation up to 1000 dimensions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Bordino, Stefano Favaro, Sandra Fortini</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a recent and growing literature on large-width asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties of deep Gaussian neural networks (NNs), namely NNs with weights initialized as Gaussian distributions. For a Gaussian NN of depth $L\geq1$ and width $n\geq1$, it is well-known that, as $n\rightarrow+\infty$, the NN's output converges (in distribution) to a Gaussian process. Recently, some quantitative versions of this result, also known as quantitative central limit theorems (QCLTs), have been obtained, showing that the rate of convergence is $n^{-1}$, in the $2$-Wasserstein distance, and that such a rate is optimal. In this paper, we investigate the use of second-order Poincar\'e inequalities as an alternative approach to establish QCLTs for the NN's output. Previous approaches consist of a careful analysis of the NN, by combining non-trivial probabilistic tools with ad-hoc techniques that rely on the recursive definition of the network, typically by means of an induction argument over the layers, and it is unclear if and how they still apply to other NN's architectures. Instead, the use of second-order Poincar\'e inequalities rely only on the fact that the NN is a functional of a Gaussian process, reducing the problem of establishing QCLTs to the algebraic problem of computing the gradient and Hessian of the NN's output, which still applies to other NN's architectures. We show how our approach is effective in establishing QCLTs for the NN's output, though it leads to suboptimal rates of convergence. We argue that such a worsening in the rates is peculiar to second-order Poincar\'e inequalities, and it should be interpreted as the "cost" for having a straightforward, and general, procedure for obtaining QCLTs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is more ubiquitous in multiple domains. Smartphones, social media platforms, search engines, and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of applications that utilize artificial intelligence technologies to enhance their performance. This study carries out a scoping review of the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. The goal was to find the most advanced technologies used in different domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three recognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning domain: Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine Learning Research, and Machine Learning, and articles published in 2022 were observed. Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the technology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or otherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must show improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts of the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the data gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured, and the technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum manual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating labeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or semi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched. The learning algorithms should be able to be updated efficiently, and predictions should be interpretable. Using artificial intelligence technologies in real-world applications, safety and explainable predictions are mandatory to consider before mass adoption can occur.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Palumbo, Yang Guo, Xi Wu, Jiefeng Chen, Yingyu Liang, Somesh Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Both transduction and rejection have emerged as important techniques for defending against adversarial perturbations. A recent work by Goldwasser et al. showed that rejection combined with transduction can give provable guarantees (for certain problems) that cannot be achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, under recent strong adversarial attacks, their work was shown to have low performance in a practical deep-learning setting. In this paper, we take a step towards realizing the promise of transduction+rejection in more realistic scenarios. Our key observation is that a novel application of a reduction technique by Tram\`er, which was until now only used to demonstrate the vulnerability of certain defenses, can be used to actually construct effective defenses. Theoretically, we show that a careful application of this technique in the transductive setting can give significantly improved sample-complexity for robust generalization. Our theory guides us to design a new transductive algorithm for learning a selective model; extensive experiments using state of the art attacks show that our approach provides significantly better robust accuracy (81.6% on CIFAR-10 and 57.9% on CIFAR-100 under $l_\infty$ with budget 8/255) than existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Yi Lu, Yi-Jie Cheng, Chun-Liang Li, Hsuan-Tien Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Active Learning (AL) addresses the crucial challenge of enabling machines to efficiently gather labeled examples through strategic queries. Among the many AL strategies, Uncertainty Sampling (US) stands out as one of the most widely adopted. US queries the example(s) that the current model finds uncertain, proving to be both straightforward and effective. Despite claims in the literature suggesting superior alternatives to US, community-wide acceptance remains elusive. In fact, existing benchmarks for tabular datasets present conflicting conclusions on the continued competitiveness of US. In this study, we review the literature on AL strategies in the last decade and build the most comprehensive open-source AL benchmark to date to understand the relative merits of different AL strategies. The benchmark surpasses existing ones by encompassing a broader coverage of strategies, models, and data. Through our investigation of the conflicting conclusions in existing tabular AL benchmarks by evaluation under broad AL experimental settings, we uncover fresh insights into the often-overlooked issue of using machine learning models--**model compatibility** in the context of US. Specifically, we notice that adopting the different models for the querying unlabeled examples and learning tasks would degrade US's effectiveness. Notably, our findings affirm that US maintains a competitive edge over other strategies when paired with compatible models. These findings have practical implications and provide a concrete recipe for AL practitioners, empowering them to make informed decisions when working with tabular classifications with limited labeled data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Chun-Hei Lam, Justin Sirignano, Konstantinos Spiliopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical methods are developed to characterize the asymptotics of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the number of hidden units, data samples in the sequence, hidden state updates, and training steps simultaneously grow to infinity. In the case of an RNN with a simplified weight matrix, we prove the convergence of the RNN to the solution of an infinite-dimensional ODE coupled with the fixed point of a random algebraic equation. The analysis requires addressing several challenges which are unique to RNNs. In typical mean-field applications (e.g., feedforward neural networks), discrete updates are of magnitude $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the number of updates is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Therefore, the system can be represented as an Euler approximation of an appropriate ODE/PDE, which it will converge to as $N \rightarrow \infty$. However, the RNN hidden layer updates are $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, RNNs cannot be represented as a discretization of an ODE/PDE and standard mean-field techniques cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a fixed point analysis for the evolution of the RNN memory states, with convergence estimates in terms of the number of update steps and the number of hidden units. The RNN hidden layer is studied as a function in a Sobolev space, whose evolution is governed by the data sequence (a Markov chain), the parameter updates, and its dependence on the RNN hidden layer at the previous time step. Due to the strong correlation between updates, a Poisson equation must be used to bound the fluctuations of the RNN around its limit equation. These mathematical methods give rise to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) limits for RNNs trained on data sequences as the number of data samples and size of the neural network grow to infinity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitian Wu, Chenxiao Yang, Kaipeng Zeng, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naveen Raman, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Juyeon Heo, Mateja Jamnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept-based explainability methods use human-understandable intermediaries to produce explanations for machine learning models. These methods assume concept predictions can help understand a model's internal reasoning. In this work, we assess the degree to which such an assumption is true by analyzing whether concept predictors leverage ``relevant'' features to make predictions, a term we call locality. Concept-based models that fail to respect localities also fail to be explainable because concept predictions are based on spurious features, making the interpretation of the concept predictions vacuous. To assess whether concept-based models respect localities, we construct and use three metrics to characterize when models respect localities, complementing our analysis with theoretical results. Each of our metrics captures a different notion of perturbation and assess whether perturbing ``irrelevant'' features impacts the predictions made by a concept predictors. We find that many concept-based models used in practice fail to respect localities because concept predictors cannot always clearly distinguish distinct concepts. Based on these findings, we propose suggestions for alleviating this issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte, Karim Elmaaroufi, Stefan J. Witwicki, Matei Zaharia, Sanjit A. Seshia</p>
<p>Abstract: Expert demonstrations have proven an easy way to indirectly specify complex tasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal specifications, e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations. Unfortunately, these techniques are generally not sample efficient. In this work, we introduce $L^*LM$, an algorithm for learning DFAs from both demonstrations and natural language. Due to the expressivity of natural language, we observe a significant improvement in the data efficiency of learning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, $L^*LM$ leverages large language models to answer membership queries about the underlying task. This is then combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from demonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our experiments, we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a powerful few-shot learner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Zhu, Shijie Ma, Zhen Cheng, Xu-Yao Zhang, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, existing studies are largely based on the closed-world assumption, which assumes that the environment is stationary, and the model is fixed once deployed. In many real-world applications, this fundamental and rather naive assumption may not hold because an open environment is complex, dynamic, and full of unknowns. In such cases, rejecting unknowns, discovering novelties, and then continually learning them, could enable models to be safe and evolve continually as biological systems do. This article presents a holistic view of open-world machine learning by investigating unknown rejection, novelty discovery, and continual learning in a unified paradigm. The challenges, principles, and limitations of current methodologies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances are summarized. Finally, we discuss several potential directions for further progress in the field. By providing a comprehensive introduction to the emerging open-world machine learning paradigm, this article aims to help researchers build more powerful AI systems in their respective fields, and to promote the development of artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: When deploying time series forecasting models based on machine learning to real world settings, one often encounter situations where the data distribution drifts. Such drifts expose the forecasting models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and machine learning models lack robustness in these settings. Robustness can be improved by using deep generative models or genetic algorithms to augment time series datasets, but these approaches lack interpretability and are computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable and simple framework for generating time series. Our method combines time-series decompositions with analytic functions, and is able to generate time series with characteristics matching both in- and out-of-distribution data. This approach allows users to generate new time series in an interpretable fashion, which can be used to augment the dataset and improve forecasting robustness. We demonstrate our framework through EXPRTS, a visual analytics tool designed for univariate time series forecasting models and datasets. Different visualizations of the data distribution, forecasting errors and single time series instances enable users to explore time series datasets, apply transformations, and evaluate forecasting model robustness across diverse scenarios. We show how our framework can generate meaningful OOD time series that improve model robustness, and we validate EXPRTS effectiveness and usability through three use-cases and a user study.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09760">Hierarchical Decision Making Based on Structural Information Principles</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianghua Zeng, Hao Peng, Dingli Su, Angsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a promising approach for managing task complexity across multiple levels of abstraction and accelerating long-horizon agent exploration. However, the effectiveness of hierarchical policies heavily depends on prior knowledge and manual assumptions about skill definitions and task decomposition. In this paper, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-based framework, namely SIDM, for hierarchical Decision Making in both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. Central to our work is the utilization of structural information embedded in the decision-making process to adaptively and dynamically discover and learn hierarchical policies through environmental abstractions. Specifically, we present an abstraction mechanism that processes historical state-action trajectories to construct abstract representations of states and actions. We define and optimize directed structural entropy, a metric quantifying the uncertainty in transition dynamics between abstract states, to discover skills that capture key transition patterns in RL environments. Building on these findings, we develop a skill-based learning method for single-agent scenarios and a role-based collaboration method for multi-agent scenarios, both of which can flexibly integrate various underlying algorithms for enhanced performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and stability of policy learning by up to 32.70%, 64.86%, and 88.26%, respectively, as measured by average rewards, convergence timesteps, and standard deviations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuning Yang, Han Yu, Chuan Sun, Tianrun Gao, Xiaohong Liu, Xiaodong Xu, Ping Zhang, Guangyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm for training models on local sensitive data with privacy protection. Pre-trained transformer-based models have emerged as useful foundation models (FMs) to be fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, large-scale pre-trained models make it challenging for traditional FL due to high communication overhead in the resource-constrained IoT. This has inspired the field of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) research. Existing PEFT methods attempt to optimize model performance at the given dropout level. Such an approach places the burden on human users to find a dropout rate that provides a satisfactory level of performance through trial-and-error, which is time consuming and resource intensive. To address this limitation, we propose the Step-wise Parameter Dropout for Continual Federated Learning (SPD-CFL) approach. Instead of pre-defining a desired dropout rate, it allows users to specify the target level of performance and then attempts to find the most suitable dropout rate for the given FL model. Specifically, on the server side, SPD-CFL drops trainable parameters in a stepwise manner to improve communication efficiency by reducing the rank of low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The sensitivity-based gradient consistency (SGC) measure is designed to facilitate the adaptive adjustment of parameter dropout. In addition, SPD-CFL introduces continual learning (CL) on the client side to mitigate performance degradation due to the inconsistent optima with distinct parameter dropout rates under heterogeneous FL. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark dataset CIFAR-10 and a real-world medical Face dataset demonstrate significant superiority of SPD-CFL over state-of-the-art methods. Compared to the best-performing baseline, it achieves a 2.07% higher test AUC while reducing communication overhead by 29.53%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Zhang, Xuanyu Cao, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) necessitates that edge devices conduct local training and communicate with a parameter server, resulting in significant energy consumption. A key challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which limits their operational lifespan and impacts learning performance. To tackle this issue, we implement energy harvesting techniques in FL systems to capture ambient energy, thereby providing continuous power to edge devices. We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is affected by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states. To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Baharoon, Jonathan Klein, Dominik L. Michels</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language contrastive learning frameworks such as CLIP enable learning representations from natural language supervision and provide strong zero-shot classification capabilities. However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks such as segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different downstream vision tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples in the self-supervised learning path and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. Moreover, Harmony optimizes for five different objectives simultaneously, efficiently utilizing the supervision in each data example, making it even more suited in data-constrained settings. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and outperforms the previously leading joint self- and weakly supervised methods, SLIP, MaskCLIP, and DetailCLIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ju-Seung Byun, Andrew Perrault</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) training is inherently unstable due to factors such as moving targets and high gradient variance. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) can introduce additional difficulty. Differing preferences can complicate the alignment process, and prediction errors in a trained reward model can become more severe as the LLM generates unseen outputs. To enhance training robustness, RL has adopted techniques from supervised learning, such as ensembles and layer normalization. In this work, we improve the stability of RL training by adapting the reverse cross entropy (RCE) from supervised learning for noisy data to define a symmetric RL loss. We demonstrate performance improvements across various tasks and scales. We conduct experiments in discrete action tasks (Atari games) and continuous action space tasks (MuJoCo benchmark and Box2D) using Symmetric A2C (SA2C) and Symmetric PPO (SPPO), with and without added noise with especially notable performance in SPPO across different hyperparameters. Furthermore, we validate the benefits of the symmetric RL loss when using SPPO for large language models through improved performance in RLHF tasks, such as IMDB positive sentiment sentiment and TL;DR summarization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jueqing Lu, Wray Buntine, Yuanyuan Qi, Joanna Dipnall, Belinda Gabbe, Lan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Resolving conflicts is critical for improving the reliability of multi-view classification. While prior work focuses on learning consistent and informative representations across views, it often assumes perfect alignment and equal importance of all views, an assumption rarely met in real-world scenarios, as some views may express distinct information. To address this, we develop a computational trust-based discounting method that enhances the Evidential Multi-view framework by accounting for the instance-wise reliability of each view through a probability-sensitive trust mechanism. We evaluate our method on six real-world datasets using Top-1 Accuracy, Fleiss' Kappa, and a new metric, Multi-View Agreement with Ground Truth, to assess prediction reliability. We also assess the effectiveness of uncertainty in indicating prediction correctness via AUROC. Additionally, we test the scalability of our method through end-to-end training on a large-scale dataset. The experimental results show that computational trust can effectively resolve conflicts, paving the way for more reliable multi-view classification models in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takuya Ito, Luca Cocchi, Tim Klinger, Parikshit Ram, Murray Campbell, Luke Hearne</p>
<p>Abstract: In transformers, the positional encoding (PE) provides essential information that distinguishes the position and order amongst tokens in a sequence. Most prior investigations of PE effects on generalization were tailored to 1D input sequences, such as those presented in natural language, where adjacent tokens (e.g., words) are highly related. In contrast, many real world tasks involve datasets with highly non-trivial positional arrangements, such as datasets organized in multiple spatial dimensions, or datasets for which ground truth positions are not known. Here we find that the choice of initialization of a learnable PE greatly influences its ability to learn interpretable PEs that lead to enhanced generalization. We empirically demonstrate our findings in three experiments: 1) A 2D relational reasoning task; 2) A nonlinear stochastic network simulation; 3) A real world 3D neuroscience dataset, applying interpretability analyses to verify the learning of accurate PEs. Overall, we find that a learned PE initialized from a small-norm distribution can 1) uncover interpretable PEs that mirror ground truth positions in multiple dimensions, and 2) lead to improved generalization. These results illustrate the feasibility of learning identifiable and interpretable PEs for enhanced generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of causal effects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as personalized medicine. A powerful approach for this is conformal prediction, which has several practical benefits due to model-agnostic finite-sample guarantees. Yet, existing methods for conformal prediction of causal effects are limited to binary/discrete treatments and make highly restrictive assumptions such as known propensity scores. In this work, we provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced through propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are valid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample prediction intervals for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating the derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal prediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose conformal prediction for continuous treatments when the propensity score is unknown and must be estimated from data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Rowbottom, Georg Maierhofer, Teo Deveney, Eike Mueller, Alberto Paganini, Katharina Schratz, Pietro Li\`o, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Chris Budd</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel, and effective, approach to achieve optimal mesh relocation in finite element methods (FEMs). The cost and accuracy of FEMs is critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. Mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the mesh geometry to obtain the best solution accuracy at given computational budget. Classical r-adaptivity relies on the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to determine mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing, and relies on estimates that relate interpolation- and FEM-error. Recent machine learning approaches have focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Instead, our new approach trains a graph neural network (GNN) to determine mesh point locations by directly minimising the FE solution error from the PDE system Firedrake to achieve higher solution accuracy. Our GNN architecture closely aligns the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing classical estimates for optimality with a learnable strategy. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. Our method outperforms both classical, and prior ML, approaches to r-adaptive meshing. In particular, it achieves lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse engineer the computation performed by a neural network in terms of its internal components. Although there is a growing body of research on mechanistic interpretation of neural networks, the notion of a mechanistic interpretation itself is often ad-hoc. Inspired by the notion of abstract interpretation from the program analysis literature that aims to develop approximate semantics for programs, we give a set of axioms that formally characterize a mechanistic interpretation as a description that approximately captures the semantics of the neural network under analysis in a compositional manner. We demonstrate the applicability of these axioms for validating mechanistic interpretations on an existing, well-known interpretability study as well as on a new case study involving a Transformer-based model trained to solve the well-known 2-SAT problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Kubaty, Bartosz W\'ojcik, Bart{\l}omiej Krzepkowski, Monika Michaluk, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Jary Pomponi, Kamil Adamczewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Early exits enable the network's forward pass to terminate early by attaching trainable internal classifiers to the backbone network. Existing early-exit methods typically adopt either a joint training approach, where the backbone and exit heads are trained simultaneously, or a disjoint approach, where the heads are trained separately. However, the implications of this choice are often overlooked, with studies typically adopting one approach without adequate justification. This choice influences training dynamics and its impact remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a set of metrics to analyze early-exit training dynamics and guide the choice of training strategy. We demonstrate that conventionally used joint and disjoint regimes yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a mixed training strategy: the backbone is trained first, followed by the training of the entire multi-exit network. Through comprehensive evaluations of training strategies across various architectures, datasets, and early-exit methods, we present the strengths and weaknesses of the early exit training strategies. In particular, we show consistent improvements in performance and efficiency using the proposed mixed strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyue Zhang, Benjie Wang, Marta Kwiatkowska, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most methods for neural network verification focus on bounding the image, i.e., set of outputs for a given input set. This can be used to, for example, check the robustness of neural network predictions to bounded perturbations of an input. However, verifying properties concerning the preimage, i.e., the set of inputs satisfying an output property, requires abstractions in the input space. We present a general framework for preimage abstraction that produces under- and over-approximations of any polyhedral output set. Our framework employs cheap parameterised linear relaxations of the neural network, together with an anytime refinement procedure that iteratively partitions the input region by splitting on input features and neurons. The effectiveness of our approach relies on carefully designed heuristics and optimization objectives to achieve rapid improvements in the approximation volume. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating significant improvement in efficiency and scalability to high-input-dimensional image classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Further, we showcase the application to quantitative verification and robustness analysis, presenting a sound and complete algorithm for the former and providing sound quantitative results for the latter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Denoodt, Bart de Boer, Jos\'e Oramas</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Smooth InfoMax (SIM), a self-supervised representation learning method that incorporates interpretability constraints into the latent representations at different depths of the network. Based on $\beta$-VAEs, SIM's architecture consists of probabilistic modules optimized locally with the InfoNCE loss to produce Gaussian-distributed representations regularized toward the standard normal distribution. This creates smooth, well-defined, and better-disentangled latent spaces, enabling easier post-hoc analysis. Evaluated on speech data, SIM preserves the large-scale training benefits of Greedy InfoMax while improving the effectiveness of post-hoc interpretability methods across layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Jindong Han, Wei Fan, Leilei Sun, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a semantic-oriented PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a semantic-oriented decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitian Wu, David Wipf, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (e.g., observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model as a principled mathematical framework for understanding the mechanism of MPNNs and navigating novel architectural designs. Inspired by physical systems, the model combines the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified perspective on common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLP, GCN, GIN, APPNP, GCNII, GAT, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers, whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets, ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Mondorf, Sondre Wold, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental question in interpretability research is to what extent neural networks, particularly language models, implement reusable functions through subnetworks that can be composed to perform more complex tasks. Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have made progress in identifying $\textit{circuits}$, which represent the minimal computational subgraphs responsible for a model's behavior on specific tasks. However, most studies focus on identifying circuits for individual tasks without investigating how functionally similar circuits $\textit{relate}$ to each other. To address this gap, we study the modularity of neural networks by analyzing circuits for highly compositional subtasks within a transformer-based language model. Specifically, given a probabilistic context-free grammar, we identify and compare circuits responsible for ten modular string-edit operations. Our results indicate that functionally similar circuits exhibit both notable node overlap and cross-task faithfulness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the circuits identified can be reused and combined through set operations to represent more complex functional model capabilities.</p>

FutureFill reduces generation time from quadratic to quasilinear in the context length. Moreover, when generating from a prompt, it requires a prefill cache whose size grows only with the number of tokens to be generated, often much smaller than the caches required by standard convolutional or attention based models. We validate our theoretical claims with experiments on synthetic tasks and demonstrate substantial efficiency gains when generating from a deep convolutional sequence prediction model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensemble methods are known for enhancing the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models by combining multiple base learners. However, standard approaches like greedy or random ensembling often fall short, as they assume a constant weight across samples for the ensemble members. This can limit expressiveness and hinder performance when aggregating the ensemble predictions. In this study, we explore employing regularized neural networks as ensemble methods, emphasizing the significance of dynamic ensembling to leverage diverse model predictions adaptively. Motivated by the risk of learning low-diversity ensembles, we propose regularizing the ensembling model by randomly dropping base model predictions during the training. We demonstrate this approach provides lower bounds for the diversity within the ensemble, reducing overfitting and improving generalization capabilities. Our experiments showcase that the regularized neural ensemblers yield competitive results compared to strong baselines across several modalities such as computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained generalist policies are rapidly gaining relevance in robot learning due to their promise of fast adaptation to novel, in-domain tasks. This adaptation often relies on collecting new demonstrations for a specific task of interest and applying imitation learning algorithms, such as behavioral cloning. However, as soon as several tasks need to be learned, we must decide which tasks should be demonstrated and how often? We study this multi-task problem and explore an interactive framework in which the agent adaptively selects the tasks to be demonstrated. We propose AMF (Active Multi-task Fine-tuning), an algorithm to maximize multi-task policy performance under a limited demonstration budget by collecting demonstrations yielding the largest information gain on the expert policy. We derive performance guarantees for AMF under regularity assumptions and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness to efficiently fine-tune neural policies in complex and high-dimensional environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikai Zhang, Rui Hu, Ping Liu, Jiahao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning enables the fine-tuning of foundation models (FMs) across distributed clients for specific tasks; however, its scalability is limited by the heterogeneity of client memory capacities. In this work, we propose Fed-pilot, a memory-efficient federated fine-tuning framework. It enables memory-constrained clients to participate in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based fine-tuning by training only a subset of LoRA modules locally. Fed-pilot identifies the optimal selection of trainable LoRA modules as a knapsack optimization problem, maximizing model performance under memory constraints for each client. To mitigate inconsistencies arising from heterogeneous module allocations and Non-IID data, Fed-pilot employs a novel aggregation rule that dynamically compensates for under-updated layers. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets across various heterogeneous data settings demonstrate Fed-pilot's effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on federated fine-tuning of FMs that integrates memory-constrained optimization. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xihang Yue, Yi Yang, Linchao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in operator learning have produced two distinct approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs): attention-based methods offering point-level adaptability but lacking spectral constraints, and spectral-based methods providing domain-level continuity priors but limited in local flexibility. This dichotomy has hindered the development of PDE solvers with both strong flexibility and generalization capability. This work introduces Holistic Physics Mixer (HPM), a simple framework that bridges this gap by integrating spectral and physical information in a unified space. HPM unifies both approaches as special cases while enabling more powerful spectral-physical interactions beyond either method alone. This enables HPM to inherit both the strong generalization of spectral methods and the flexibility of attention mechanisms while avoiding their respective limitations. Through extensive experiments across diverse PDE problems, we demonstrate that HPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, while maintaining strong generalization capabilities with limited training data and excellent zero-shot performance on unseen resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Frans, Danijar Hafner, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models and flow-matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce shortcut models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) across various domains, understanding and enhancing their mathematical capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of LLMs' mathematical abilities, with a specific focus on their arithmetic performances. We identify numerical precision as a key factor that influences their effectiveness in arithmetical tasks. Our results show that Transformers operating with low numerical precision fail to address arithmetic tasks, such as iterated addition and integer multiplication, unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In contrast, Transformers with standard numerical precision can efficiently handle these tasks with significantly smaller model sizes. We further support our theoretical findings through empirical experiments that explore the impact of varying numerical precision on arithmetic tasks, providing valuable insights for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jong-Ik Park, Srinivasa Pranav, Jos\'e M. F. Moura, Carlee Joe-Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are now a major focus of leading technology organizations due to their ability to generalize across diverse tasks. Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4% in IID and up to 15.8% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reece Shuttleworth, Jacob Andreas, Antonio Torralba, Pratyusha Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in trainable parameters. But, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not. Further, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and find its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by causally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated singular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover, scaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training distribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we should expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more forgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of sequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder dimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the practicality of our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viacheslav Surkov, Chris Wendler, Antonio Mari, Mikhail Terekhov, Justin Deschenaux, Robert West, Caglar Gulcehre, David Bau</p>
<p>Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Mehdizavareh, Arijit Khan, Simon Lebech Cichosz</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning Wu, Han Huang, Yueting Xu, Zhifeng Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained traction in transportation, bioinformatics, language and image processing, but research on their application to supply chain management remains limited. Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsushi Kudo</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers around the world operate a variety of NWP models. In addition, recent advances in AI-driven NWP models have further increased the availability of NWP outputs. While this expansion holds the potential to improve forecast accuracy, it raises a critical question: which prediction is the most plausible? If the NWP models have comparable accuracy, it is impossible to determine in advance which one is the best. Traditional approaches, such as ensemble or weighted averaging, combine multiple NWP outputs to produce a single forecast with improved accuracy. However, they often result in meteorologically unrealistic and uninterpretable outputs, such as the splitting of tropical cyclone centers or frontal boundaries into multiple distinct systems.
  To address this issue, we propose DeepMedcast, a deep learning method that generates intermediate forecasts between two or more NWP outputs. Unlike averaging, DeepMedcast provides predictions in which meteorologically significant features -- such as the locations of tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, fronts, and shear lines -- approximately align with the arithmetic mean of the corresponding features predicted by the input NWP models, without distorting meteorological structures. We demonstrate the capability of DeepMedcast through case studies and verification results, showing that it produces realistic and interpretable forecasts with higher accuracy than the input NWP models. By providing plausible intermediate forecasts, DeepMedcast can significantly contribute to the efficiency and standardization of operational forecasting tasks, including general, marine, and aviation forecasts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) benefit from large and diverse datasets for their training. Since this data is often scraped from the Internet without permission from the data owners, this raises concerns about copyright and intellectual property protections. While (illicit) use of data is easily detected for training samples perfectly re-created by a DM at inference time, it is much harder for data owners to verify if their data was used for training when the outputs from the suspect DM are not close replicas. Conceptually, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which detect if a given data point was used during training, present themselves as a suitable tool to address this challenge. However, we demonstrate that existing MIAs are not strong enough to reliably determine the membership of individual images in large, state-of-the-art DMs. To overcome this limitation, we propose CDI, a framework for data owners to identify whether their dataset was used to train a given DM. CDI relies on dataset inference techniques, i.e., instead of using the membership signal from a single data point, CDI leverages the fact that most data owners, such as providers of stock photography, visual media companies, or even individual artists, own datasets with multiple publicly exposed data points which might all be included in the training of a given DM. By selectively aggregating signals from existing MIAs and using new handcrafted methods to extract features for these datasets, feeding them to a scoring model, and applying rigorous statistical testing, CDI allows data owners with as little as 70 data points to identify with a confidence of more than 99% whether their data was used to train a given DM. Thereby, CDI represents a valuable tool for data owners to claim illegitimate use of their copyrighted data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengjie Zheng, Haipeng Chen, Lin Cheng, Shengping Gong, Xu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Six, Alexandre Chidiac, Arkin Worlikar</p>
<p>Abstract: This document is an evaluation of the original "Rank-N-Contrast" (arXiv:2210.01189v2) paper published in 2023. This evaluation is done for academic purposes. Deep regression models often fail to capture the continuous nature of sample orders, creating fragmented representations and suboptimal performance. To address this, we reproduced the Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) framework, which learns continuous representations by contrasting samples by their rankings in the target space. Our study validates RNC's theoretical and empirical benefits, including improved performance and robustness. We extended the evaluation to an additional regression dataset and conducted robustness tests using a holdout method, where a specific range of continuous data was excluded from the training set. This approach assessed the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This replication study validates the original findings and broadens the understanding of RNC's applicability and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brett Barkley, David Fridovich-Keil</p>
<p>Abstract: Dyna-style off-policy model-based reinforcement learning (DMBRL) algorithms are a family of techniques for generating synthetic state transition data and thereby enhancing the sample efficiency of off-policy RL algorithms. This paper identifies and investigates a surprising performance gap observed when applying DMBRL algorithms across different benchmark environments with proprioceptive observations. We show that, while DMBRL algorithms perform well in OpenAI Gym, their performance can drop significantly in DeepMind Control Suite (DMC), even though these settings offer similar tasks and identical physics backends. Modern techniques designed to address several key issues that arise in these settings do not provide a consistent improvement across all environments, and overall our results show that adding synthetic rollouts to the training process -- the backbone of Dyna-style algorithms -- significantly degrades performance across most DMC environments. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of several fundamental challenges in model-based RL and show that, like many optimization fields, there is no free lunch when evaluating performance across diverse benchmarks in RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghoon Na, Haizhao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates that when a shallow neural network with a Lipschitz continuous activation function is trained using either empirical or population risk to approximate a target function that is $r$ times continuously differentiable on $[0,1]^d$, the population risk may not decay at a rate faster than $t^{-\frac{4r}{d-2r}}$, where $t$ is an analog of the total number of optimization iterations. This result highlights the presence of the curse of dimensionality in the optimization computation required to achieve a desired accuracy. Instead of analyzing parameter evolution directly, the training dynamics are examined through the evolution of the parameter distribution under the 2-Wasserstein gradient flow. Furthermore, it is established that the curse of dimensionality persists when a locally Lipschitz continuous activation function is employed, where the Lipschitz constant in $[-x,x]$ is bounded by $O(x^\delta)$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$. In this scenario, the population risk is shown to decay at a rate no faster than $t^{-\frac{(4+2\delta)r}{d-2r}}$. Understanding how function smoothness influences the curse of dimensionality in neural network optimization theory is an important and underexplored direction that this work aims to address.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Kirtania, Arun Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Junjiao Tian, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) or kernel ridge regression is a widely used and powerful tool for nonlinear prediction. Therefore, active learning (AL) for GPR, which actively collects data labels to achieve an accurate prediction with fewer data labels, is an important problem. However, existing AL methods do not theoretically guarantee prediction accuracy for target distribution. Furthermore, as discussed in the distributionally robust learning literature, specifying the target distribution is often difficult. Thus, this paper proposes two AL methods that effectively reduce the worst-case expected error for GPR, which is the worst-case expectation in target distribution candidates. We show an upper bound of the worst-case expected squared error, which suggests that the error will be arbitrarily small by a finite number of data labels under mild conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing RNA molecules that interact with specific proteins is a critical challenge in experimental and computational biology. Existing computational approaches require a substantial amount of previously known interacting RNA sequences for each specific protein or a detailed knowledge of RNA structure, restricting their utility in practice. To address this limitation, we develop RNA-BAnG, a deep learning-based model designed to generate RNA sequences for protein interactions without these requirements. Central to our approach is a novel generative method, Bidirectional Anchored Generation (BAnG), which leverages the observation that protein-binding RNA sequences often contain functional binding motifs embedded within broader sequence contexts. We first validate our method on generic synthetic tasks involving similar localized motifs to those appearing in RNAs, demonstrating its benefits over existing generative approaches. We then evaluate our model on biological sequences, showing its effectiveness for conditional RNA sequence design given a binding protein.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adri\`a L\'opez Escoriza, Nicklas Hansen, Stone Tao, Tongzhou Mu, Hao Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-horizon tasks in robotic manipulation present significant challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) due to the difficulty of designing dense reward functions and effectively exploring the expansive state-action space. However, despite a lack of dense rewards, these tasks often have a multi-stage structure, which can be leveraged to decompose the overall objective into manageable subgoals. In this work, we propose DEMO3, a framework that exploits this structure for efficient learning from visual inputs. Specifically, our approach incorporates multi-stage dense reward learning, a bi-phasic training scheme, and world model learning into a carefully designed demonstration-augmented RL framework that strongly mitigates the challenge of exploration in long-horizon tasks. Our evaluations demonstrate that our method improves data-efficiency by an average of 40% and by 70% on particularly difficult tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We validate this across 16 sparse-reward tasks spanning four domains, including challenging humanoid visual control tasks using as few as five demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurag Singh, Siu Lun Chau, Krikamol Muandet</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Wang, Pengan Chen, Jingqi Zhou, Qintong Li, Jingwei Dong, Jiahui Gao, Boyang Xue, Jiyue Jiang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model customization necessitates high-quality and diverse datasets, but acquiring such data remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. Despite the great potential of large language models (LLMs) for data synthesis, current approaches are constrained by limited seed data, model biases, and low-variation prompts, resulting in limited diversity and biased distributions with the increase of data scales. To tackle this challenge, we introduce TREESYNTH, a tree-guided subspace-based data synthesis approach inspired by decision trees. It constructs a spatial partitioning tree to recursively divide a task-specific full data space (i.e., root node) into numerous atomic subspaces (i.e., leaf nodes) with mutually exclusive and exhaustive attributes to ensure both distinctiveness and comprehensiveness before synthesizing samples within each atomic subspace. This globally dividing-and-synthesizing method finally collects subspace samples into a comprehensive dataset, effectively circumventing repetition and space collapse to ensure the diversity of large-scale data synthesis. Furthermore, the spatial partitioning tree enables sample allocation into atomic subspaces, allowing the rebalancing of existing datasets for more balanced and comprehensive distributions. Empirically, extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superior data diversity, model performance, and robust scalability of TREESYNTH compared to both human-crafted datasets and peer data synthesis methods, with an average performance gain reaching 10%. Besides, the consistent improvements of TREESYNTH-balanced datasets highlight its efficacious application to redistribute existing datasets for more comprehensive coverage and the induced performance enhancement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang An, Yuxing Liu, Rui Pan, Yi Ren, Shiqian Ma, Donald Goldfarb, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep neural networks is a structured optimization problem, because the parameters are naturally represented by matrices and tensors rather than by vectors. Under this structural representation, it has been widely observed that gradients are low-rank and Hessians are approximately block-wise diagonal. These structured properties are crucial for designing efficient optimization algorithms, but are not utilized by many current popular optimizers like Adam. In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm ASGO that capitalizes on these properties by employing a preconditioner that is adaptively updated using structured gradients. By fine-grained theoretical analysis, ASGO is proven to achieve superior convergence rates compared to existing structured gradient methods. Based on the convergence theory, we further demonstrate that ASGO can benefit from the low-rank and block-wise diagonal properties. We also discuss practical modifications of ASGO and empirically verify ASGO's effectiveness on language model tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discrete Diffusion and Flow Matching models have significantly advanced generative modeling for discrete structures, including graphs. However, the dependencies between intermediate noisy states lead to error accumulation and propagation during the reverse denoising process - a phenomenon known as compounding denoising errors. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Simple Iterative Denoising, which simplifies discrete diffusion and circumvents the issue by assuming conditional independence between intermediate states. Additionally, we enhance our model by incorporating a Critic. During generation, the Critic selectively retains or corrupts elements in an instance based on their likelihood under the data distribution. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines in graph generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudio Spiess, Mandana Vaziri, Louis Mandel, Martin Hirzel</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.06\pm15.3$ percentage points), up to 68.9pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Kashefi, Tapan Mukerji</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have gained attention as an alternative to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for deep learning applications in computational physics, particularly for solving inverse problems with sparse data, as exemplified by the physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (PIKAN). However, the capability of KANs to simultaneously solve inverse problems over multiple irregular geometries within a single training run remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (PI-KAN-PointNet), in which shared KANs are integrated into the PointNet architecture to capture the geometric features of computational domains. The loss function comprises the squared residuals of the governing equations, computed via automatic differentiation, along with sparse observations and partially known boundary conditions. We construct shared KANs using Jacobi polynomials and investigate their performance by considering Jacobi polynomials of different degrees and types in terms of both computational cost and prediction accuracy. As a benchmark test case, we consider natural convection in a square enclosure with a cylinder, where the cylinder's shape varies across a dataset of 135 geometries. PI-KAN-PointNet offers two main advantages. First, it overcomes the limitation of current PIKANs, which are restricted to solving only a single computational domain per training run, thereby reducing computational costs. Second, when comparing the performance of PI-KAN-PointNet with that of the physics-informed PointNet using MLPs, we observe that, with approximately the same number of trainable parameters and comparable computational cost in terms of the number of epochs, training time per epoch, and memory usage, PI-KAN-PointNet yields more accurate predictions, particularly for values on unknown boundary conditions involving nonsmooth geometries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacques Cloete, Nikolaus Vertovec, Alessandro Abate</p>
<p>Abstract: To apply reinforcement learning to safety-critical applications, we ought to provide safety guarantees during both policy training and deployment. In this work, we present theoretical results that place a bound on the probability of violating a safety property for a new task-specific policy in a model-free, episodic setting. This bound, based on a maximum policy ratio computed with respect to a 'safe' base policy, can also be applied to temporally-extended properties (beyond safety) and to robust control problems. To utilize these results, we introduce SPoRt, which provides a data-driven method for computing this bound for the base policy using the scenario approach, and includes Projected PPO, a new projection-based approach for training the task-specific policy while maintaining a user-specified bound on property violation. SPoRt thus enables users to trade off safety guarantees against task-specific performance. Complementing our theoretical results, we present experimental results demonstrating this trade-off and comparing the theoretical bound to posterior bounds derived from empirical violation rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose DARSLP, a simple gloss-free, transformer-based sign language production (SLP) framework that directly maps spoken-language text to sign pose sequences. We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from sentence-level text embeddings. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL-divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: At the current stage, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated excellent capabilities in evaluating aerodynamic performance, significantly reducing the time and cost required for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. However, when faced with the task of processing extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) vehicle models, the lack of large-scale datasets and training resources, coupled with the inherent diversity and complexity of the geometry of different vehicle models, means that the prediction accuracy and versatility of these networks are still not up to the level required for current production. In view of the remarkable success of Transformer models in the field of natural language processing and their strong potential in the field of image processing, this study innovatively proposes a point cloud learning framework called DrivAer Transformer (DAT). The DAT structure uses the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which contains high-fidelity CFD data of industrial-standard 3D vehicle shapes. enabling accurate estimation of air drag directly from 3D meshes, thus avoiding the limitations of traditional methods such as 2D image rendering or signed distance fields (SDF). DAT enables fast and accurate drag prediction, driving the evolution of the aerodynamic evaluation process and laying the critical foundation for introducing a data-driven approach to automotive design. The framework is expected to accelerate the vehicle design process and improve development efficiency.</p>

This study introduces a novel approach by incorporating specific trip destinations-such as home, work, medical appointments, social activities, and errands-using geohashing to analyze the driving habits of older drivers in Nebraska. We employed a two-fold methodology that combines data visualization with advanced machine learning models, including C5.0, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to assess the effectiveness of these location-based variables in predicting cognitive impairment. Notably, the C5.0 model showed a robust and stable performance, achieving a median recall of 0.68, which indicates that our methodology accurately identifies cognitive impairment in drivers 68\% of the time. This emphasizes our model's capacity to reduce false negatives, a crucial factor given the profound implications of failing to identify impaired drivers. Our findings underscore the innovative use of life-space variables in understanding and predicting cognitive decline, offering avenues for early intervention and tailored support for affected individuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenting Wang, Guofeng Cui, Yu-Jhe Li, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhao Yan, Yafu Li, Zican Hu, Zhi Wang, Ganqu Cui, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards~(\textit{RLVR}). However, existing \textit{RLVR} approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{LUFFY} (\textbf{L}earning to reason \textbf{U}nder o\textbf{FF}-polic\textbf{Y} guidance), a framework that augments \textit{RLVR} with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Specifically, LUFFY combines the Mixed-Policy GRPO framework, which has a theoretically guaranteed convergence rate, alongside policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Compared with previous RLVR methods, LUFFY achieves an over \textbf{+6.4} average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over \textbf{+6.2} points in out-of-distribution tasks. Most significantly, we show that LUFFY successfully trains weak models in scenarios where on-policy RLVR completely fails. These results provide compelling evidence that LUFFY transcends the fundamental limitations of on-policy RLVR and demonstrates the great potential of utilizing off-policy guidance in RLVR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iman Khadir, Shane Stevenson, Henry Li, Kyle Krick, Abram Burrows, David Hall, Stan Posey, Samuel S. P. Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elliot L. Epstein, Rajat Dwaraknath, Thanawat Sornwanee, John Winnicki, Jerry Weihong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel method for density estimation that leverages an estimated score function to debias kernel density estimation (SD-KDE). In our approach, each data point is adjusted by taking a single step along the score function with a specific choice of step size, followed by standard KDE with a modified bandwidth. The step size and modified bandwidth are chosen to remove the leading order bias in the KDE. Our experiments on synthetic tasks in 1D, 2D and on MNIST, demonstrate that our proposed SD-KDE method significantly reduces the mean integrated squared error compared to the standard Silverman KDE, even with noisy estimates in the score function. These results underscore the potential of integrating score-based corrections into nonparametric density estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordi de la Torre</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate a scalable methodology for harmonizing inconsistent units in large-scale clinical datasets, addressing a key barrier to data interoperability.
  Materials and Methods: We designed a novel unit harmonization system combining BM25, sentence embeddings, Bayesian optimization, and a bidirectional transformer based binary classifier for retrieving and matching laboratory test entries. The system was evaluated using the Optum Clinformatics Datamart dataset (7.5 billion entries). We implemented a multi-stage pipeline: filtering, identification, harmonization proposal generation, automated re-ranking, and manual validation. Performance was assessed using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and other standard information retrieval metrics.
  Results: Our hybrid retrieval approach combining BM25 and sentence embeddings (MRR: 0.8833) significantly outperformed both lexical-only (MRR: 0.7985) and embedding-only (MRR: 0.5277) approaches. The transformer-based reranker further improved performance (absolute MRR improvement: 0.10), bringing the final system MRR to 0.9833. The system achieved 83.39\% precision at rank 1 and 94.66\% recall at rank 5.
  Discussion: The hybrid architecture effectively leverages the complementary strengths of lexical and semantic approaches. The reranker addresses cases where initial retrieval components make errors due to complex semantic relationships in medical terminology.
  Conclusion: Our framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for unit harmonization in clinical datasets, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy. Once harmonized, data can be reused seamlessly in different analyses, ensuring consistency across healthcare systems and enabling more reliable multi-institutional studies and meta-analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hwanwoo Kim, Panos Toulis, Eric Laber</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, TD procedures are generally sensitive to step size specification. A poor choice of step size can dramatically increase variance and slow convergence in both on-policy and off-policy evaluation tasks. In practice, researchers use trial and error to identify stable step sizes, but these approaches tend to be ad hoc and inefficient. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed point equations. Such updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, we derive asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds for our proposed implicit TD algorithms, which include implicit TD(0), TD($\lambda$), and TD with gradient correction (TDC). Our results show that implicit TD algorithms are applicable to a much broader range of step sizes, and thus provide a robust and versatile framework for policy evaluation and value approximation in modern RL tasks. We demonstrate these benefits empirically through extensive numerical examples spanning both on-policy and off-policy tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Chen, Keyu Yan, Lin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function. Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear margins on the more challenging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu Luo, Xi Lin, Mengyuan Zhong, Fei Liu, Zhenkun Wang, Jianyong Sun, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimisation (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) without extensive manual design. While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches, L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior performance across various problem sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Mestoukirdi, Mourad Khanfouci</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ECHO-LLaMA, an efficient LLaMA architecture designed to improve both the training speed and inference throughput of LLaMA architectures while maintaining its learning capacity. ECHO-LLaMA transforms LLaMA models into shared KV caching across certain layers, significantly reducing KV computational complexity while maintaining or improving language performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO-LLaMA achieves up to 77\% higher token-per-second throughput during training, up to 16\% higher Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU), and up to 14\% lower loss when trained on an equal number of tokens. Furthermore, on the 1.1B model, ECHO-LLaMA delivers approximately 7\% higher test-time throughput compared to the baseline. By introducing a computationally efficient adaptation mechanism, ECHO-LLaMA offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for pretraining and finetuning large language models, enabling faster and more resource-efficient training without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Xia, Hao Feng, Hongwei Sun, Junjie Wang, Qicong Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for recovering missing values in power load data due to its ability to exploit the inherent low-dimensional structures of spatiotemporal measurements. Among various techniques, low-rank factorization models are favoured for their efficiency and interpretability. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of regularization parameters, which are typically fixed or manually tuned, resulting in limited generalization capability or slow convergence in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Regularization-optimized Low-Rank Factorization, which introduces a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to adaptively adjust the regularization coefficient. Furthermore, we provide a detailed algorithmic complexity analysis, showing that our method preserves the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent while improving adaptivity. Experimental results on real-world power load datasets validate the superiority of our method in both imputation accuracy and training efficiency compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianmarco Genalti, Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper initiates the study of data-dependent regret bounds in constrained MAB settings. These bounds depend on the sequence of losses that characterize the problem instance. Thus, they can be much smaller than classical $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, while being equivalent to them in the worst case. Despite this, data-dependent regret bounds have been completely overlooked in constrained MAB settings. The goal of this paper is to answer the following question: Can data-dependent regret bounds be derived in the presence of constraints? We answer this question affirmatively in constrained MABs with adversarial losses and stochastic constraints. Specifically, our main focus is on the most challenging and natural settings with hard constraints, where the learner must ensure that the constraints are always satisfied with high probability. We design an algorithm with a regret bound consisting of two data-dependent terms. The first term captures the difficulty of satisfying the constraints, while the second one encodes the complexity of learning independently of the presence of constraints. We also prove a lower bound showing that these two terms are not artifacts of our specific approach and analysis, but rather the fundamental components that inherently characterize the complexities of the problem. Finally, in designing our algorithm, we also derive some novel results in the related (and easier) soft constraints settings, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bao Pham, Gabriel Raya, Matteo Negri, Mohammed J. Zaki, Luca Ambrogioni, Dmitry Krotov</p>
<p>Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is unavailable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant computational resources and prolonged training durations. To address this challenge, we build upon prior work that introduced a neural architecture with permutation-invariant sensory processing. We propose a modified attention mechanism that applies a non-linear transformation to the key vectors (K), producing enriched representations (K') through a custom mapping function. This Nonlinear Attention (NLA) mechanism enhances the representational capacity of the attention layer, enabling the agent to learn more expressive feature interactions. As a result, our model achieves significantly faster convergence and improved training efficiency, while maintaining performance on par with the baseline. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear attention mechanisms to accelerate reinforcement learning without sacrificing effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuze Chen, Tianyi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector, structurally resembling bilinear systems. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Bilinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we propose a novel Bilinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates superior performance and computation efficiency in both language and vision modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Cetin, Tianyu Zhao, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs) focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean Memery, Kevin Denamganai, Anna Kapron-King, Kartic Subr</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs, typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain. The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes. In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a neural network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Chen, Zhengwei Fang, Xiao Yang, Chao Yu, Zhaoxia Yin, Hang Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Sondej, Yushi Yang, Miko{\l}aj Kniejski, Marcel Windys</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyi Lu, Yiding Sun, Jinqian Chen, Zhichuan Yang, Jiangming Pan, Jihua Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by 75%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Ferle, Jonas Ader, Thomas Wiemers, Nora Grieb, Adrian Lindenmeyer, Hans-Jonas Meyer, Thomas Neumuth, Markus Kreuz, Kristin Reiche, Maximilian Merz</p>
<p>Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Mlodozeniec, Isaac Reid, Sam Power, David Krueger, Murat Erdogdu, Richard E. Turner, Roger Grosse</p>
<p>Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments, e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly, we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyuan Dong, Dingkang Yang, Xiao Liang, Chao Feng, Jiao Ran</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc. Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler choices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Chen, Soumyadeep Pal, Yimeng Zhang, Qing Qu, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM unlearning, seeks to remove specific undesirable data or knowledge from a trained model, while maintaining its performance on standard tasks. While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine whether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant inputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad applicability of unlearning trace detection. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned given an input query.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyue Jiang, Jiahao Cui, Xiaowen Dong, Laura Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a critical task in fields ranging from molecule design to drug discovery. Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between a reference distribution and the data distribution. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space. We show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling convergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design the probability path for graph generation. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that respects the underlying geometry of graphs and provides smooth velocities in the probability path. The novel framework can be adapted to both continuous and discrete flow-matching algorithms. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and 2D/3D molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow in graph generation with competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Yuan, Yin Zheng, Taifeng Wang, Binbin Liu, Hongteng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance. The code of the experiments is available at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Shortcut learning undermines model generalization to out-of-distribution data. While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP. Our study redefines the landscape of model generalization by addressing overlooked semantic biases, establishing SCISSOR as a foundational framework for mitigating shortcut learning and fostering more robust, bias-resistant AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains. However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice and multi-slice scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Gao, Zhichang Guo, Dazhi Zhang, Dong Li, Runze Liu, Pengfei Li, Kai Tian, Biqing Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion, preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework. Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth (IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT), further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target LLM's capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL) that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior. Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.</p>

Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality. The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Consolo, Edoardo Amaldi, Emilio Carrizosa</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15 well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended to consider group fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce three concepts that describe an agent's incentives: response incentives indicate which variables in the environment, such as sensitive demographic information, affect the decision under the optimal policy. Instrumental control incentives indicate whether an agent's policy is chosen to manipulate part of its environment, such as the preferences or instructions of a user. Impact incentives indicate which variables an agent will affect, intentionally or otherwise. For each concept, we establish sound and complete graphical criteria, and discuss general classes of techniques that may be used to produce incentives for safe and fair agent behaviour. Finally, we outline how these notions may be generalised to multi-decision settings. This journal-length paper extends our conference publications "Incentives for Responsiveness, Instrumental Control and Impact" and "Agent Incentives: A Causal Perspective": the material on response incentives and instrumental control incentives is updated, while the work on impact incentives and multi-decision settings is entirely new.</p>

Taking certain one-parameter slices of degree-Rips recovers well-known methods for density-based clustering, but we show that these methods are unstable. However, we prove that degree-Rips, as a multiparameter object, is stable, and we propose an alternative approach for taking slices of degree-Rips, which yields a one-parameter hierarchical clustering algorithm with better stability properties. We prove that this algorithm is consistent, using the correspondence-interleaving distance. We provide an algorithm for extracting a single clustering from one-parameter hierarchical clusterings, which is stable with respect to the correspondence-interleaving distance. And, we integrate these methods into a pipeline for density-based clustering, which we call Persistable. Adapting tools from multiparameter persistent homology, we propose visualization tools that guide the selection of all parameters of the pipeline. We demonstrate Persistable on benchmark data sets, showing that it identifies multi-scale cluster structure in data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghalib Ahmed Tahir, Chu Kiong Loo</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic food detection is an emerging topic of interest due to its wide array of applications ranging from detecting food images on social media platforms to filtering non-food photos from the users in dietary assessment apps. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an eating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public places. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high accuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and selecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a nonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable feature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method extracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good generalization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality problem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix with large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel multicolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d tree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each subset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel structures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the k-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For evaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using nine publically available datasets. Experimental results showed the superiority of our method on an integrated set of measures while solving the problem of 'curse of dimensionality in KELM for large datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpan Kusari, Wenbo Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Subgraph isomorphism, also known as subgraph matching, is typically regarded as an NP-complete problem. This complexity is further compounded in practical applications where edge weights are real-valued and may be affected by measurement noise and potential missing data. Such graph matching routinely arises in applications such as image matching and map matching. Most subgraph matching methods fail to perform node-to-node matching under presence of such corruptions. We propose a method for identifying the node correspondence between a subgraph and a full graph in the inexact case without node labels in two steps - (a) extract the minimal unique topology preserving subset from the subgraph and find its feasible matching in the full graph, and (b) implement a consensus-based algorithm to expand the matched node set by pairing unique paths based on boundary commutativity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation is performed on the Erdos-Renyi random graphs and two case studies are performed on the image-based affine covariant features dataset and KITTI stereo dataset respectively. Going beyond the existing subgraph matching approaches, the proposed method is shown to have realistically sub-linear computational efficiency, robustness to random measurement noise, and good statistical properties. Our method is also readily applicable to the exact matching case without loss of generality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaochao Zhou, Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many analysis and prediction tasks require the extraction of structured data from unstructured texts. However, an annotation scheme and a training dataset have not been available for training machine learning models to mine structured data from text without special templates and patterns. To solve it, this paper presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, Text2Struct, including a text annotation scheme, training data processing, and machine learning implementation. We formulated the mining problem as the extraction of metrics and units associated with numerals in the text. Text2Struct was trained and evaluated using an annotated text dataset collected from abstracts of medical publications regarding thrombectomy. In terms of prediction performance, a dice coefficient of 0.82 was achieved on the test dataset. By random sampling, most predicted relations between numerals and entities were well matched to the ground-truth annotations. These results show that Text2Struct is viable for the mining of structured data from text without special templates or patterns. It is anticipated to further improve the pipeline by expanding the dataset and investigating other machine learning models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuetong Wu, Jonathan H. Manton, Uwe Aickelin, Jingge Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The generalization error of a learning algorithm refers to the discrepancy between the loss of a learning algorithm on training data and that on unseen testing data. Various information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error have been derived in the literature, where the mutual information between the training data and the hypothesis (the output of the learning algorithm) plays an important role. Focusing on the individual sample mutual information bound by Bu et al., which itself is a tightened version of the first bound on the topic by Russo et al. and Xu et al., this paper investigates the tightness of these bounds, in terms of the dependence of their convergence rates on the sample size $n$. It has been recognized that these bounds are in general not tight, readily verified for the exemplary quadratic Gaussian mean estimation problem, where the individual sample mutual information bound scales as $O(\sqrt{1/n})$ while the true generalization error scales as $O(1/n)$. The first contribution of this paper is to show that the same bound can in fact be asymptotically tight if an appropriate assumption is made. In particular, we show that the fast rate can be recovered when the assumption is made on the excess risk instead of the loss function, which was usually done in existing literature. A theoretical justification is given for this choice. The second contribution of the paper is a new set of generalization error bounds based on the $(\eta, c)$-central condition, a condition relatively easy to verify and has the property that the mutual information term directly determines the convergence rate of the bound. Several analytical and numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of these bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of solving a large-scale system of linear equations in a distributed or federated manner by a taskmaster and a set of machines, each possessing a subset of the equations. We provide a comprehensive comparison of two well-known classes of algorithms used to solve this problem: projection-based methods and optimization-based methods. First, we introduce a novel geometric notion of data heterogeneity called angular heterogeneity and discuss its generality. Using this notion, we characterize the optimal convergence rates of the most prominent algorithms from each class, capturing the effects of the number of machines, the number of equations, and that of both cross-machine and local data heterogeneity on these rates. Our analysis establishes the superiority of Accelerated Projected Consensus in realistic scenarios with significant data heterogeneity and offers several insights into how angular heterogeneity affects the efficiency of the methods studied. Additionally, we develop distributed algorithms for the efficient computation of the proposed angular heterogeneity metrics. Our extensive numerical analyses validate and complement our theoretical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YongTaek Lim, Yewon Kim, Suho Kang, Dokyung Yoon, KyungWoo Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models surpass in transferability and robust generalization across diverse datasets. The emergence of multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP has significantly boosted performance in various experiments. However, generalizing to new datasets or domains remains challenging, especially with limited labeled data. Also, existing methods often lack interpretability and impose high computational costs. To address this, we propose Robust Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph (RPLKG), leveraging the knowledge graph to curate diverse, interpretable prompt sets automatically. Our method autonomously selects the optimal interpretable prompt based on dataset characteristics, achieving performance improvements over zero-shot learning and competitive performance compared to various prompt learning methods. Also, RPLKG efficiently reuses cached prompt embeddings from a single model pass and optimizes prompt selection via Gumbel-Softmax, enabling low-memory, fast training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiye Lei, Hao Chen, Sen Zhang, Bo Zhao, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), it has become a common practice to train models on synthetic data due to data-scarcity and privacy leakage problems. Owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts. Considering the impressive ability of large generative models, could such models directly synthesize good training images for prediction tasks with proper prompts? We offer an affirmative response to this question by proposing a simple yet effective method, validated through ImageNet classification. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. We show that this simple caption incorporation significantly boosts the informativeness of synthetic data therefore enhancing downstream model generalization. More importantly, besides improvements in data augmentation and privacy preservation, our experiments demonstrate that synthesized images can exceed real data in terms of out-of-distribution robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shan Ali, Chaima Boufaied, Domenico Bianculli, Paula Branco, Lionel Briand</p>
<p>Abstract: Growth in system complexity increases the need for automated log analysis techniques, such as Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD). While deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used for LAD, traditional machine learning (ML) techniques can also perform well depending on the context and dataset. Semi-supervised techniques deserve the same attention as they offer practical advantages over fully supervised methods. Current evaluations mainly focus on detection accuracy, but this alone is insufficient to determine the suitability of a technique for a given LAD task. Other aspects to consider include training and prediction times as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, which in practice matters to engineers.
  This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating a wide range of supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques across four criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning in both detection accuracy and time performance. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques fare similarly in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time on most of the benchmark datasets considered in our study. Moreover, overall, sensitivity analysis to hyperparameter tuning with respect to detection accuracy shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Forough Fazeli-Asl, Michael Minyi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel generative model within the Bayesian non-parametric learning (BNPL) framework to address some notable failure modes in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs)--these being overfitting in the GAN case and noisy samples in the VAE case. We will demonstrate that the BNPL framework enhances training stability and provides robustness and accuracy guarantees when incorporating the Wasserstein distance and maximum mean discrepancy measure (WMMD) into our model's loss function. Moreover, we introduce a so-called ``triple model'' that combines the GAN, the VAE, and further incorporates a code-GAN (CGAN) to explore the latent space of the VAE. This triple model design generates high-quality, diverse samples, while the BNPL framework, leveraging the WMMD loss function, enhances training stability. Together, these components enable our model to achieve superior performance across various generative tasks. These claims are supported by both theoretical analyses and empirical validation on a wide variety of datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Zhou, Guang Cheng, Zongyao Chen, Shui Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has gained significant adoption in Android malware detection to address the escalating threats posed by the rapid proliferation of malware attacks. However, recent studies have revealed the inherent vulnerabilities of ML-based detection systems to evasion attacks. While efforts have been made to address this critical issue, many of the existing defensive methods encounter challenges such as lower effectiveness or reduced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MalPurifier, a novel adversarial purification framework specifically engineered for Android malware detection. Specifically, MalPurifier integrates three key innovations: a diversified adversarial perturbation mechanism for robustness and generalizability, a protective noise injection strategy for benign data integrity, and a Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) with a dual-objective loss for accurate purification and classification. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that MalPurifier significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. It robustly defends against a comprehensive set of 37 perturbation-based evasion attacks, consistently achieving robust accuracies above 90.91%. As a lightweight, model-agnostic, and plug-and-play module, MalPurifier offers a practical and effective solution to bolster the security of ML-based Android malware detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuewen Liu, Zhikai Li, Junrui Xiao, Mengjuan Chen, Jianquan Li, Qingyi Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation tasks. However, the lengthy denoising process and complex neural networks hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Quantization can effectively reduce model complexity, and post-training quantization (PTQ), which does not require fine-tuning, is highly promising for compressing and accelerating diffusion models. Unfortunately, we find that due to the highly dynamic activations, existing PTQ methods suffer from distribution mismatch issues at both calibration sample level and reconstruction output level, which makes the performance far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose EDA-DM, a standardized PTQ method that efficiently addresses the above issues. Specifically, at the calibration sample level, we extract information from the density and diversity of latent space feature maps, which guides the selection of calibration samples to align with the overall sample distribution; and at the reconstruction output level, we theoretically analyze the reasons for previous reconstruction failures and, based on this insight, optimize block reconstruction using the Hessian loss of layers, aligning the outputs of quantized model and full-precision model at different network granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDA-DM significantly outperforms the existing PTQ methods across various models and datasets. Our method achieves a 1.83 times speedup and 4 times compression for the popular Stable-Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.05 loss in CLIP score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salvatore Contino, Paolo Sortino, Maria Rita Gulotta, Ugo Perricone, Roberto Pirrone</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics. Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retinal fundus images play a crucial role in the early detection of eye diseases. However, the impact of technical factors on these images can pose challenges for reliable AI applications in ophthalmology. For example, large fundus cohorts are often confounded by factors like camera type, bearing the risk of learning shortcuts rather than the causal relationships behind the image generation process. Here, we introduce a population model for retinal fundus images that effectively disentangles patient attributes from camera effects, enabling controllable and highly realistic image generation. To achieve this, we propose a disentanglement loss based on distance correlation. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that our models encode desired information in disentangled subspaces and enable controllable image generation based on the learned subspaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of our disentanglement loss.

<p>Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performing models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across the dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation through user studies with two models and three time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD, which fosters a deeper model understanding, immediate corrective actions, and model reliability enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiucai Ding, Rong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrative analysis of multiple heterogeneous datasets has become standard practice in many research fields, especially in single-cell genomics and medical informatics. Existing approaches oftentimes suffer from limited power in capturing nonlinear structures, insufficient account of noisiness and effects of high-dimensionality, lack of adaptivity to signals and sample sizes imbalance, and their results are sometimes difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we propose a novel kernel spectral method that achieves joint embeddings of two independently observed high-dimensional noisy datasets. The proposed method automatically captures and leverages possibly shared low-dimensional structures across datasets to enhance embedding quality. The obtained low-dimensional embeddings can be utilized for many downstream tasks such as simultaneous clustering, data visualization, and denoising. The proposed method is justified by rigorous theoretical analysis. Specifically, we show the consistency of our method in recovering the low-dimensional noiseless signals, and characterize the effects of the signal-to-noise ratios on the rates of convergence. Under a joint manifolds model framework, we establish the convergence of ultimate embeddings to the eigenfunctions of some newly introduced integral operators. These operators, referred to as duo-landmark integral operators, are defined by the convolutional kernel maps of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). These RKHSs capture the either partially or entirely shared underlying low-dimensional nonlinear signal structures of the two datasets. Our numerical experiments and analyses of two single-cell omics datasets demonstrate the empirical advantages of the proposed method over existing methods in both embeddings and several downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusong Zhang, Kun Xie, Xingyi Zhang, Xiangyu Dong, Sibo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The spread of rumors on social media, particularly during significant events like the US elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, poses a serious threat to social stability and public health. Current rumor detection methods primarily rely on propagation graphs to improve the model performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often compromised by noisy and irrelevant structures in the propagation process. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, they depend heavily on rich original propagation structures, limiting their effectiveness in handling rumors that lack sufficient propagation information, especially in the early stages of dissemination. In this work, we introduce the Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based framework, that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information and identifies significant substructures in events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG comprises two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns latent variable distributions from refined propagation patterns to eliminate noise and generate new candidates for ENS, while ENS identifies the most influential substructures in propagation graphs and provides training data for CRG. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards derived from a pre-trained graph neural network to guide the training process. The resulting key propagation graphs are then employed in downstream rumor detection tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that KPG outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Eilers, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer, Sven Goedeke</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ka Man Lo, Zeyu Huang, Zihan Qiu, Zili Wang, Jie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) is gaining increasing attention due to its unique properties and remarkable performance, especially for language tasks. By sparsely activating a subset of parameters for each token, MoE architecture could increase the model size without sacrificing computational efficiency, achieving a better trade-off between performance and training costs. However, the underlying mechanism of MoE still lacks further exploration, and its modularization degree remains questionable. In this paper, we make an initial attempt to understand the inner workings of MoE-based large language models. Concretely, we comprehensively study the parametric and behavioral features of three popular MoE-based models and reveal some intriguing observations, including 1) Neurons act like fine-grained experts; 2) The router of MoE usually selects experts with larger output norms; 3) The expert diversity increases as the layer increases, while the last layer is an outlier, which is further validated by an initial experiment. Based on the observations, we also provide suggestions for a broad spectrum of MoE practitioners, such as router design and expert allocation. We hope this work could shed light on future research on the MoE framework and other modular architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/kamanphoebe/Look-into-MoEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a unified framework in which consciousness emerges as a cycle-consistent, affectively anchored inference process, recursively structured by the interaction of emotion and cognition. Drawing from information theory, optimal transport, and the Bayesian brain hypothesis, we formalize emotion as a low-dimensional structural prior and cognition as a specificity-instantiating update. This emotion-cognition cycle minimizes joint uncertainty by aligning emotionally weighted priors with context-sensitive cognitive appraisals. Subjective experience thus arises as the informational footprint of temporally extended, affect-modulated simulation. We introduce the Exchangeable Integration Theory of Consciousness (EITC), modeling conscious episodes as conditionally exchangeable samples drawn from a latent affective self-model. This latent variable supports integration, via a unified cause-effect structure with nonzero irreducibility, and differentiation, by preserving contextual specificity across episodes. We connect this architecture to the Bayesian theory of consciousness through Rao-Blackwellized inference, which stabilizes inference by marginalizing latent self-structure while enabling adaptive updates. This mechanism ensures coherence, prevents inference collapse, and supports goal-directed simulation. The formal framework builds on De Finetti's exchangeability theorem, integrated information theory, and KL-regularized optimal transport. Overall, consciousness is reframed as a recursive inference process, shaped by emotion, refined by cognition, stabilized through exchangeability, and unified through a latent self-model that integrates experience across time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Clinton, Yiding Chen, Xiaojin Zhu, Kirthevasan Kandasamy</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a collaborative learning problem where $m$ agents aim to estimate a vector $\mu =(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d$ by sampling from associated univariate normal distributions $\{\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)\}_{k\in[d]}$. Agent $i$ incurs a cost $c_{i,k}$ to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$. Instead of working independently, agents can exchange data, collecting cheaper samples and sharing them in return for costly data, thereby reducing both costs and estimation error. We design a mechanism to facilitate such collaboration, while addressing two key challenges: ensuring individually rational (IR) and fair outcomes so all agents benefit, and preventing strategic behavior (e.g. non-collection, data fabrication) to avoid socially undesirable outcomes. We design a mechanism and an associated Nash equilibrium (NE) which minimizes the social penalty-sum of agents' estimation errors and collection costs-while being IR for all agents. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation to the minimum social penalty in the worst case and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximation under favorable conditions. Additionally, we establish three hardness results: no nontrivial mechanism guarantees (i) a dominant strategy equilibrium where agents report truthfully, (ii) is IR for every strategy profile of other agents, (iii) or avoids a worst-case $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ price of stability in any NE. Finally, by integrating concepts from axiomatic bargaining, we demonstrate that our mechanism supports fairer outcomes than one which minimizes social penalty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Partha Chakraborty, Mahmoud Alfadel, Meiyappan Nagappan</p>
<p>Abstract: Software bugs require developers to exert significant effort to identify and resolve them, often consuming about one-third of their time. Bug localization, the process of pinpointing the exact source code files that need modification, is crucial in reducing this effort. Existing bug localization tools, typically reliant on deep learning techniques, face limitations in cross-project applicability and effectiveness in multi-language environments. Recent advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) offer detailed representations for bug localization. However, they encounter challenges with limited context windows and mapping accuracy. To address these issues, we propose BLAZE, an approach that employs dynamic chunking and hard example learning. First, BLAZE dynamically segments source code to minimize continuity loss. Then, BLAZE fine-tunes a GPT-based model using challenging bug cases, in order to enhance cross-project and cross-language bug localization. To support the capability of BLAZE, we create the BEETLEBOX dataset, which comprises 26,321 bugs from 29 large and thriving open-source projects across five different programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Go, and JavaScript). Our evaluations of BLAZE on three benchmark datasets BEETLEBOX, SWE-Bench, and Ye et al. demonstrate substantial improvements compared to six state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, BLAZE achieves up to an increase of 120% in Top 1 accuracy, 144% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), and 100% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). An extensive ablation study confirms the contributions of our pipeline components to the overall performance enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minas Karamanis, Uro\v{s} Seljak</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on large particle ensembles for accurate estimates. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that systematically retains and reuses particles from all prior iterations to construct a growing, weighted ensemble. By leveraging multiple importance sampling and resampling from a mixture of historical distributions, PS mitigates the need for excessively large particle counts, directly addressing key limitations of SMC such as particle impoverishment and mode collapse. Crucially, PS achieves this without additional likelihood evaluations-weights for persistent particles are computed using cached likelihood values. This framework not only yields more accurate posterior approximations but also produces marginal likelihood estimates with significantly lower variance, enhancing reliability in model comparison. Furthermore, the persistent ensemble enables efficient adaptation of transition kernels by leveraging a larger, decorrelated particle pool. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, hierarchical models, and non-convex targets demonstrate that PS consistently outperforms standard SMC and related variants, including recycled and waste-free SMC, achieving substantial reductions in mean squared error for posterior expectations and evidence estimates, all at reduced computational cost. PS thus establishes itself as a robust, scalable, and efficient alternative for complex Bayesian inference tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junnan Yang, Huiling Zhang, Zi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their importance in various emerging applications, efficient algorithms for solving minimax problems have recently received increasing attention. However, many existing algorithms require prior knowledge of the problem parameters in order to achieve optimal iteration complexity. In this paper, three completely parameter-free single-loop algorithms, namely PF-AGP-NSC algorithm, PF-AGP-NC algorithm and PF-AGP-NL algorithm, are proposed to solve the smooth nonconvex-strongly concave, nonconvex-concave minimax problems and nonconvex-linear minimax problems respectively using line search without requiring any prior knowledge about parameters such as the Lipschtiz constant $L$ or the strongly concave modulus $\mu$. Furthermore, we prove that the total number of gradient calls required to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point for the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm, the PF-AGP-NC algorithm, and the PF-AGP-NL algorithm are upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L^2\kappa^3\varepsilon^{-2} \right)$, $\mathcal{O}\left( \log^2(L)L^4\varepsilon^{-4} \right)$, and $\mathcal{O}\left( L^3\varepsilon^{-3} \right)$, respectively, where $\kappa$ is the condition number. To the best of our knowledge, PF-AGP-NC and PF-AGP-NL are the first completely parameter-free algorithms for solving nonconvex-concave and nonconvex-linear minimax problems, respectively. PF-AGP-NSC is a completely parameter-free algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, achieving the best known complexity with respect to $\varepsilon$. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the three proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhan Guo, Yatao Bian, Ruibing Wang, Nan Yin, Zhen Wang, Quanming Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks has driven the research community to extend their capabilities to molecular applications. However, most molecular LLMs employ adapter-based architectures that do not treat molecule and text modalities equally and lack a supervision signal for the molecule modality. To address these issues, we introduce UniMoT, a Unified Molecule-Text LLM adopting a tokenizer-based architecture that expands the vocabulary of LLM with molecule tokens. Specifically, we introduce a Vector Quantization-driven tokenizer that incorporates a Q-Former to bridge the modality gap between molecule and text. This tokenizer transforms molecules into sequences of molecule tokens with causal dependency, encapsulating high-level molecular and textual information. Equipped with this tokenizer, UniMoT can unify molecule and text modalities under a shared token representation and an autoregressive training paradigm, enabling it to interpret molecules as a foreign language and generate them as text. Following a four-stage training scheme, UniMoT emerges as a multi-modal generalist capable of performing both molecule-to-text and text-to-molecule tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMoT achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of molecule comprehension and generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geonhee Kim, Marco Valentino, Andr\'e Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies on reasoning in language models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether they can learn systematic inferential principles or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. To understand and uncover the mechanisms adopted for formal reasoning in LMs, this paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic inference. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at interpreting content-independent and formal reasoning mechanisms. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic inference, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes, model sizes and architectures. The identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for syllogistic schemes on which the models achieve high accuracy (>60%), with compatible activation patterns across models of different families. Overall, our findings suggest that LMs learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalizable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron Musco, Christopher Musco, Lucas Rosenblatt, Apoorv Vikram Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of approximately recovering a probability distribution given noisy measurements of its Chebyshev polynomial moments. This problem arises broadly across algorithms, statistics, and machine learning. By leveraging a global decay bound on the coefficients in the Chebyshev expansion of any Lipschitz function, we sharpen prior work, proving that accurate recovery in the Wasserstein distance is possible with more noise than previously known. Our result immediately yields a number of applications:
  1) We give a simple "linear query" algorithm for constructing a differentially private synthetic data distribution with Wasserstein-$1$ error $\tilde{O}(1/n)$ based on a dataset of $n$ points in $[-1,1]$. This bound is optimal up to log factors, and matches a recent result of Boedihardjo, Strohmer, and Vershynin [Probab. Theory. Rel., 2024], which uses a more complex "superregular random walk" method.
  2) We give an $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon)$ time algorithm for the linear algebraic problem of estimating the spectral density of an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix up to $\epsilon$ error in the Wasserstein distance. Our result accelerates prior methods from Chen et al. [ICML 2021] and Braverman et al. [STOC 2022].
  3) We tighten an analysis of Vinayak, Kong, Valiant, and Kakade [ICML 2019] on the maximum likelihood estimator for the statistical problem of "Learning Populations of Parameters'', extending the parameter regime in which sample optimal results can be obtained.
  Beyond these main results, we provide an extension of our bound to estimating distributions in $d > 1$ dimensions. We hope that these bounds will find applications more broadly to problems involving distribution recovery from noisy moment information.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-spatial-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. Our results indicate a potential reduction of required data points by at least a factor of 3, while maintaining the current error level. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown its remarkable and generalizable capability in legged locomotion through sim-to-real transfer. However, while adaptive methods like domain randomization are expected to enhance policy robustness across diverse environments, they potentially compromise the policy's performance in any specific environment, leading to suboptimal real-world deployment due to the No Free Lunch theorem. To address this, we propose LoopSR, a lifelong policy adaptation framework that continuously refines RL policies in the post-deployment stage. LoopSR employs a transformer-based encoder to map real-world trajectories into a latent space and reconstruct a digital twin of the real world for further improvement. Autoencoder architecture and contrastive learning methods are adopted to enhance feature extraction of real-world dynamics. Simulation parameters for continual training are derived by combining predicted values from the decoder with retrieved parameters from a pre-collected simulation trajectory dataset. By leveraging simulated continual training, LoopSR achieves superior data efficiency compared with strong baselines, yielding eminent performance with limited data in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wu, Jiaru Zhang, Zhiwei Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Saha, Ishaan Chadha, Meenakshi khosla</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Jaensch, Giuseppe Caire, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: Several studies have explored deep learning algorithms to predict large-scale signal fading, or path loss, in urban communication networks. The goal is to replace costly measurement campaigns, inaccurate statistical models, or computationally expensive ray-tracing simulations with machine learning models that deliver quick and accurate predictions. We focus on predicting path loss radio maps using convolutional neural networks, leveraging aerial images alone or in combination with supplementary height information. Notably, our approach does not rely on explicit classification of environmental objects, which is often unavailable for most locations worldwide. While the prediction of radio maps using complete 3D environmental data is well-studied, the use of only aerial images remains under-explored. We address this gap by showing that state-of-the-art models developed for existing radio map datasets can be effectively adapted to this task. Additionally, we introduce a new model dubbed UNetDCN that achieves on par or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art with reduced complexity. The trained models are differentiable, and therefore they can be incorporated in various network optimization algorithms. While an extensive discussion is beyond this paper's scope, we demonstrate this through an example optimizing the directivity of base stations in cellular networks via backpropagation to enhance coverage.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to simultaneously optimize indoor wireless and daylight performance by adjusting the positions of windows and the beam directions of window-deployed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for RIS-aided outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) networks utilizing large language models (LLM) as optimizers. Firstly, we illustrate the wireless and daylight system models of RIS-aided O2I networks and formulate a joint optimization problem to enhance both wireless traffic sum rate and daylight illumination performance. Then, we present a multi-modal LLM-based window optimization (LMWO) framework, accompanied by a prompt construction template to optimize the overall performance in a zero-shot fashion, functioning as both an architect and a wireless network planner. Finally, we analyze the optimization performance of the LMWO framework and the impact of the number of windows, room size, number of RIS units, and daylight factor. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LMWO framework can achieve outstanding optimization performance in terms of initial performance, convergence speed, final outcomes, and time complexity, compared with classic optimization methods. The building's wireless performance can be significantly enhanced while ensuring indoor daylight performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) involves discovering shared concepts across images through analogy, akin to solving IQ test problems. Bongard Problems (BPs) remain a key challenge in AVR, requiring both visual reasoning and verbal description. We investigate whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can solve BPs by formulating a set of diverse MLLM-suited solution strategies and testing $4$ proprietary and $4$ open-access models on $3$ BP datasets featuring synthetic (classic BPs) and real-world (Bongard HOI and Bongard-OpenWorld) images. Despite some successes on real-world datasets, MLLMs struggle with synthetic BPs. To explore this gap, we introduce Bongard-RWR, a dataset representing synthetic BP concepts using real-world images. Our findings suggest that weak MLLM performance on classical BPs is not due to the domain specificity, but rather comes from their general AVR limitations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minqi Shao, Jianjun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) integrate quantum computing and deep neural networks, leveraging quantum properties like superposition and entanglement to enhance machine learning algorithms. These characteristics enable QNNs to outperform classical neural networks in tasks such as quantum chemistry simulations, optimization problems, and quantum-enhanced machine learning. Despite their early success, their reliability and safety issues have posed threats to their applicability. However, due to the inherently non-classical nature of quantum mechanics, verifying QNNs poses significant challenges. To address this, we propose QCov, a set of test coverage criteria specifically designed to systematically evaluate QNN state exploration during testing, with an emphasis on superposition. These criteria help evaluate test diversity and detect underlying defects within test suites. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and QNN models validate QCov's effectiveness in reflecting test quality, guiding fuzz testing efficiently, and thereby improving QNN robustness. We also evaluate sampling costs of QCov under realistic quantum scenarios to justify its practical feasibility. Finally, the effects of unrepresentative training data distribution and parameter choice are further explored.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoaib Meraj Sami, Md Mahedi Hasan, Mohammad Saeed Ebrahimi Saadabadi, Jeremy Dawson, Nasser Nasrabadi, Raghuveer Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: While different variants of perceptual losses have been employed in super-resolution literature to synthesize more realistic, appealing, and detailed high-resolution images, most are convolutional neural networks-based, causing information loss during guidance and often relying on complicated architectures and training procedures. We propose an invertible neural network (INN)-based naive \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{G}ranular \textbf{H}igh-\textbf{F}requency (MGHF-n) perceptual loss trained on ImageNet to overcome these issues. Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive framework (MGHF-c) with several constraints to preserve, prioritize, and regularize information across multiple perspectives: texture and style preservation, content preservation, regional detail preservation, and joint content-style regularization. Information is prioritized through adaptive entropy-based pruning and reweighting of INN features. We utilize Gram matrix loss for style preservation and mean-squared error loss for content preservation. Additionally, we propose content-style consistency through correlation loss to regulate unnecessary texture generation while preserving content information. Since small image regions may contain intricate details, we employ modulated PatchNCE in the INN features as a local information preservation objective. Extensive experiments on various super-resolution algorithms, including GAN- and diffusion-based methods, demonstrate that our MGHF framework significantly improves performance. After the review process, our code will be released in the public repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Yang, Tao Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Interior design is a complex and creative discipline involving aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, and materials science. Effective solutions must meet diverse requirements, typically producing multiple deliverables such as renderings and design drawings from various perspectives. Consequently, interior design processes are often inefficient and demand significant creativity. With advances in machine learning, generative models have emerged as a promising means of improving efficiency by creating designs from text descriptions or sketches. However, few generative works focus on interior design, leading to substantial discrepancies between outputs and practical needs, such as differences in size, spatial scope, and the lack of controllable generation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DiffDesign, a controllable diffusion model with meta priors for efficient interior design generation. Specifically, we utilize the generative priors of a 2D diffusion model pre-trained on a large image dataset as our rendering backbone. We further guide the denoising process by disentangling cross-attention control over design attributes, such as appearance, pose, and size, and introduce an optimal transfer-based alignment module to enforce view consistency. Simultaneously, we construct an interior design-specific dataset, DesignHelper, consisting of over 400 solutions across more than 15 spatial types and 15 design styles. This dataset helps fine-tune DiffDesign. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DiffDesign.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linshan Hou, Wei Luo, Zhongyun Hua, Songhua Chen, Leo Yu Zhang, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arijit Samal, Haroon R Lone</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-invasive temperature monitoring of individuals plays a crucial role in identifying and isolating symptomatic individuals. Temperature monitoring becomes particularly vital in settings characterized by close human proximity, often referred to as dense settings. However, existing research on non-invasive temperature estimation using thermal cameras has predominantly focused on sparse settings. Unfortunately, the risk of disease transmission is significantly higher in dense settings like movie theaters or classrooms. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust temperature estimation methods tailored explicitly for dense settings.
  Our study proposes a non-invasive temperature estimation system that combines a thermal camera with an edge device. Our system employs YOLO models for face detection and utilizes a regression framework for temperature estimation. We evaluated the system on a diverse dataset collected in dense and sparse settings. Our proposed face detection model achieves an impressive mAP score of over 84 in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Furthermore, the regression framework demonstrates remarkable performance with a mean square error of 0.18$^{\circ}$C and an impressive $R^2$ score of 0.96. Our experiments' results highlight the developed system's effectiveness, positioning it as a promising solution for continuous temperature monitoring in real-world applications. With this paper, we release our dataset and programming code publicly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a crucial diagnostic challenge carrying immense clinical significance, for effective treatment regimens and patient management. For instance, a group of subjects termed SWEDD who are clinically diagnosed as PD, but show normal Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans, change their diagnosis as non-PD after few years of follow up, and in the meantime, they are treated with PD medications which do more harm than good. In this work, machine learning models are developed using features from SPECT images to detect early PD and SWEDD subjects from normal. These models were observed to perform with high accuracy. It is inferred from the study that these diagnostic models carry potential to help PD clinicians in the diagnostic process</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Liang, Yuncong Liu, Neng Wang, Hongyang Yang, Boyu Zhang, Christina Dan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of news on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities. However, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its dissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements. Additionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and explicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret news. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances LLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news dissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster recent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching prompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to construct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting short-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our approach improves prediction accuracy by 8\% compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew G. T. Pyo, Yuta Nagano, Martina Milighetti, James Henderson, Curtis G. Callan Jr., Benny Chain, Ned S. Wingreen, Andreas Tiffeau-Mayer</p>
<p>Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we systematically characterize how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands highly dissimilar to any seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is more important for receptor co-specificity than the hydrophobic properties that prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. Our analysis also quantifies the substantial importance of positions not in direct contact with the peptide for specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Nakhla Rafi, Dong Jae Kim, Tse-Hsun Chen, Shaowei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in software engineering tasks such as Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study investigates how input order and context size influence LLM performance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We evaluate different method orderings using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths appear first) and "worst" (where ground truths appear last), across two benchmarks containing Java and Python projects. Our results reveal a strong order bias: in Java projects, Top-1 FL accuracy drops from 57% to 20% when reversing the order, while in Python projects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3%. However, segmenting inputs into smaller contexts mitigates this bias, reducing the performance gap in FL from 22% and 6% to just 1% across both benchmarks. We replaced method names with semantically meaningful alternatives to determine whether this bias is due to data leakage. The observed trends remained consistent, suggesting that the bias is not caused by memorization from training data but rather by the inherent effect of input order. Additionally, we explored ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics, finding that DepGraph's ranking achieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming simpler approaches such as CallGraph(DFS). These findings highlight the importance of structuring inputs, managing context effectively, and selecting appropriate ordering strategies to enhance LLM performance in FL and other software engineering applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Cheng Wong, Abhishek Gupta, Chin Chun Ooi, Pao-Hsiung Chiu, Jiao Liu, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs for the first time in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast evolutionary as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyun Hong, Fan Wu, Anthony Gruber, Kookjin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the feasibility of using neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) to model systems with intrinsic privacy properties. Unlike conventional feedforward neural networks, which have unlimited expressivity and can represent arbitrary mappings between inputs and outputs, NODEs constrain their learning to the solution of a system of differential equations. We first examine whether this constraint reduces memorization and, consequently, the membership inference risks associated with NODEs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NODEs under membership inference attacks and show that they exhibit twice the resistance compared to conventional models such as ResNets. By analyzing the variance in membership risks across different NODE models, we find that their limited expressivity leads to reduced overfitting to the training data. We then demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that membership inference risks can be further mitigated by utilizing a stochastic variant of NODEs: neural stochastic differential equations (NSDEs). We show that NSDEs are differentially-private (DP) learners that provide the same provable privacy guarantees as DPSGD, the de-facto mechanism for training private models. NSDEs are also effective in mitigating membership inference attacks, achieving risk levels comparable to private models trained with DP-SGD while offering an improved privacyutility trade-off. Moreover, we propose a drop-in-replacement strategy that efficiently integrates NSDEs into conventional feedforward architectures to enhance their privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhun Lee, Minsang Seok, Jun-gyu Jin, Younghyun Cho, Eunhyeok Park</p>
<p>Abstract: While many advanced LLMs are designed to handle long sequence data, we can still observe notable quality degradation even within the sequence limit. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Scaling to Emphasize Attention for Long-context retrieval (SEAL), which enhances the retrieval performance of large language models (LLMs) over long contexts. We observe that specific attention heads are closely tied to long-context retrieval, showing positive or negative correlation with retrieval scores, and adjusting the strength of these heads boosts the quality of LLMs in long context by a large margin. Built on this insight, we propose a learning-based mechanism that leverages generated data to emphasize these heads. By applying SEAL, we achieve significant improvements in long-context retrieval performance across various tasks and models. Additionally, when combined with existing training-free context extension techniques, SEAL extends the contextual limits of LLMs while maintaining highly reliable outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce AnyEnhance, a unified generative model for voice enhancement that processes both speech and singing voices. Based on a masked generative model, AnyEnhance is capable of handling both speech and singing voices, supporting a wide range of enhancement tasks including denoising, dereverberation, declipping, super-resolution, and target speaker extraction, all simultaneously and without fine-tuning. AnyEnhance introduces a prompt-guidance mechanism for in-context learning, which allows the model to natively accept a reference speaker's timbre. In this way, it could boost enhancement performance when a reference audio is available and enable the target speaker extraction task without altering the underlying architecture. Moreover, we also introduce a self-critic mechanism into the generative process for masked generative models, yielding higher-quality outputs through iterative self-assessment and refinement. Extensive experiments on various enhancement tasks demonstrate AnyEnhance outperforms existing methods in terms of both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores how theory can guide and enhance practical algorithms, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al. 2022) in large language models as a case study. We rigorously prove that, under gradient descent, LoRA adapters align with specific singular subspaces of the one-step full fine-tuning gradient. This result suggests that, by properly initializing the adapters using the one-step full gradient, subspace alignment can be achieved immediately and applicable to both linear and nonlinear models. Building on our theory, we propose a theory-driven algorithm, LoRA-One, where the linear convergence (as well as generalization) is built and incorporating preconditioners theoretically helps mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning. Besides, our theory reveals connections between LoRA-One and other gradient-alignment-based methods, helping to clarify misconceptions in the design of such algorithms. LoRA-One achieves significant empirical improvements over LoRA and its variants across benchmarks in natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangfan Zhang, Zhiyao Cui, Jianhao Chen, Xinrun Wang, Qiaosheng Zhang, Zhen Wang, Dinghao Wu, Shuyue Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has gained significant attention as a promising line of research to improve the factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite its conceptual appeal, current MAD research suffers from critical limitations in evaluation practices, including limited benchmark coverage, weak baseline comparisons, and inconsistent setups. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 5 representative MAD methods across 9 benchmarks using 4 foundational models. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that MAD often fail to outperform simple single-agent baselines such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, even when consuming significantly more inference-time computation. To advance MAD research, we further explore the role of model heterogeneity and find it as a universal antidote to consistently improve current MAD frameworks. Based on our findings, we argue that the field must stop overvaluing MAD in its current form; for true advancement, we must critically rethink evaluation paradigms and actively embrace model heterogeneity as a core design principle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuri Kuratov, Mikhail Arkhipov, Aydar Bulatov, Mikhail Burtsev</p>
<p>Abstract: A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.</p>

In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of unlearning methods and establish the first upper and lower bounds on minimax computation times for this problem, characterizing the performance of the most efficient algorithm against the most difficult objective function. Specifically, for strongly convex objective functions and under the assumption that the forget data is inaccessible to the unlearning method, we provide a phase diagram for the unlearning complexity ratio -- a novel metric that compares the computational cost of the best unlearning method to full model retraining. The phase diagram reveals three distinct regimes: one where unlearning at a reduced cost is infeasible, another where unlearning is trivial because adding noise suffices, and a third where unlearning achieves significant computational advantages over retraining. These findings highlight the critical role of factors such as data dimensionality, the number of samples to forget, and privacy constraints in determining the practical feasibility of unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Huayu Chen, Guande He, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While likelihood-based generative models, particularly diffusion and autoregressive models, have achieved remarkable fidelity in visual generation, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective, which minimizes the forward KL divergence, inherently suffers from a mode-covering tendency that limits the generation quality under limited model capacity. In this work, we propose Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) as a unified framework that integrates likelihood-based generative training and GAN-type discrimination to bypass this fundamental constraint by exploiting reverse KL and self-generated negative signals. Our key insight is to parameterize a discriminator implicitly using the likelihood ratio between a learnable target model and a fixed reference model, drawing parallels with the philosophy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike GANs, this parameterization eliminates the need for joint training of generator and discriminator networks, allowing for direct, efficient, and effective finetuning of a well-trained model to its full potential beyond the limits of MLE. DDO can be performed iteratively in a self-play manner for progressive model refinement, with each round requiring less than 1% of pretraining epochs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DDO by significantly advancing the previous SOTA diffusion model EDM, reducing FID scores from 1.79/1.58/1.96 to new records of 1.30/0.97/1.26 on CIFAR-10/ImageNet-64/ImageNet 512x512 datasets without any guidance mechanisms, and by consistently improving both guidance-free and CFG-enhanced FIDs of visual autoregressive models on ImageNet 256x256.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkang Zhu, Xi Chen, Zhongdao Wang, Bei Yu, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, faithfully integrating evolving factual knowledge into these models remains a critical challenge. Continued pre-training on paraphrased data has shown empirical promise for enhancing knowledge acquisition. However, this approach is often costly and unreliable, as it relies on external models or manual effort for rewriting, and may inadvertently alter the factual content. In this work, we hypothesize and empirically show that an LLM's ability to continually predict the same factual knowledge tokens given diverse paraphrased contexts is positively correlated with its capacity to extract that knowledge via question-answering. Based on this view and aiming to improve generalization to diverse paraphrased contexts, we introduce two strategies to enhance LLMs' ability to predict the same knowledge tokens given varied contexts, thereby enhancing knowledge acquisition. First, we propose formatting-based data augmentation, which diversifies documents conveying the same knowledge by altering document formats rather than their content, thereby preserving factual integrity. Second, we adopt sharpness-aware minimization as the optimizer to better improve generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate our methods' effectiveness in both continued pre-training and instruction tuning, and further gains can be achieved by combining with paraphrased data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively while also minimizing bias and noise. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, versatile, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In alignment scenarios such as safety, confidence, and general preference alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but essential for transferring human preference. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function choice for LLM alignment. Similarity reward circumvents binary preference data collection and reward modeling when unary high-quality reference answers are available. We introduce \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm that does not rely on reference or reward models. RefAlign utilizes similarity metrics, such as BERTScore between sampled generations and reference answers as surrogate rewards. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, RefAlign demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods without binary preference data and reward models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewook Kang, Bum-Jae You, Juyoun Park, Yisoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for robots to operate effectively in diverse environments necessitates the need for robust real-time anomaly detection techniques during robotic operations. However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoder model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments. The code is available at https://github.com/twkang43/sparse-maf-aae.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin M. Peter, Mert Korkali</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasingly challenging task of maintaining power grid security requires innovative solutions. Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training procedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichen Li, Albert Jan, Baishakhi Ray, Junfeng Yang, Chengzhi Mao, Kexin Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: Code editing is a foundational task in software development, where its effectiveness depends on whether it introduces desired code property changes without changing the original code's intended functionality. Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. These human-agent collaboration systems enable humans and LLM-based agents to collaborate effectively by leveraging their complementary strengths. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities arising from human-AI collaboration. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rakibul Hasan, Pouria Behnoudfar, Dan MacKinlay, Thomas Poulet</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning, offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research.

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language. Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports. However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2 images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale, problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports, we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo: https://github.com/bhattarailab/Hallucination-Aware-VLM.</p>

For convex-constrained distributional regression, general upper bounds are established for the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the worst-case mean squared error (MSE) across the domain. These theoretical results are applied to isotonic and trend filtering distributional regression, yielding convergence rates consistent with those for mean estimation. Furthermore, a general upper bound is derived for distributional regression under non-convex constraints, with a specific application to neural network-based estimators. Comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real data validate the theoretical contributions, demonstrating their practical effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language models, we introduce an autoregressive method for synthesizing anatomical trees. Our approach first embeds vessel structures into a learned discrete vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous' methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code is available at https://github.com/LIA-DiTella/VesselGPT-MICCAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Li, Jing Li, Zhanyu Ju, Fengkui Gong, Lu Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol. Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under low signal-to noise ratio situations. Besides, a segmented energy refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the evaluation metrics by 2.27\% compared to existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual environment. Besides, the broadcast frame decoding results indicate that 97.30\% accuracy of RID has been achieved.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) systems face significant challenges when adapting to real-world data shifts, especially in multi-modal contexts. While robust fine-tuning strategies are essential for maintaining performance across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, current evaluation settings are primarily unimodal or particular to some types of OOD, offering limited insight into the complexities of multi-modal contexts. In this work, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across Multi-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks. We utilize ten existing VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, IV-VQA, VQA-CP, OK-VQA and others, and categorize them into ID, near and far OOD datasets covering uni-modal, multi-modal and adversarial distribution shifts. We first conduct a comprehensive comparison of existing robust fine-tuning methods. We then quantify the distribution shifts by calculating the Mahalanobis distance using uni-modal and multi-modal embeddings extracted from various models. Further, we perform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and multi-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples. These analyses offer valuable guidance on developing more robust fine-tuning methods to handle multi-modal distribution shifts.

<p>Abstract: We introduce IGNIS, a deep-learning framework for constrained parameter estimation in Archimedean copulas with natural domain $\theta \geq 1$. While illustrated here on four families (Gumbel, Joe and the novel A1/A2 copulas), IGNIS is readily applicable to any one-parameter Archimedean model with $\theta \geq 1$. Classical estimators (Method of Moments (MoM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood (MPL)) break down on A1/A2 due to non-monotonic dependence mappings, steep likelihood gradients and the need for custom constraint handling. IGNIS sidesteps these issues by learning a direct mapping from four summary statistics (Kendall's $\tau$, Spearman's $\rho$, empirical 0.95 tail-dependence and Pearson $r$) plus a one-hot family indicator to $\theta$, ending in a softplus + 1 output layer that automatically enforces $\hat{\theta} \geq 1$. Trained on 500 simulated $\theta$ values per family (10000 observations each), IGNIS outperforms the Method of Moments in extensive simulations and delivers accurate, stable estimates on real-world AAPL-MSFT returns and CDC diabetes data. Our results demonstrate a unified, constraint-aware neural estimator for modern copula-based dependence modeling, easily extendable to any copula family respecting $\theta \geq 1$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit Kumthekar, Zion Tilley, Henry Duong, Bhargav Patel, Michael Magnoli, Ahmed Omar, Ahmed Nasser, Chaitanya Gharpure, Yevgen Reztzov</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs), current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency, or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an increase in accuracy on MedQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs. F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX (Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 45.2%).</p>

<p>Abstract: Robots with multi-modal locomotion are an active research field due to their versatility in diverse environments. In this context, additional actuation can provide humanoid robots with aerial capabilities. Flying humanoid robots face challenges in modeling and control, particularly with aerodynamic forces. This paper addresses these challenges from a technological and scientific standpoint. The technological contribution includes the mechanical design of iRonCub-Mk1, a jet-powered humanoid robot, optimized for jet engine integration, and hardware modifications for wind tunnel experiments on humanoid robots for precise aerodynamic forces and surface pressure measurements. The scientific contribution offers a comprehensive approach to model and control aerodynamic forces using classical and learning techniques. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations calculate aerodynamic forces, validated through wind tunnel experiments on iRonCub-Mk1. An automated CFD framework expands the aerodynamic dataset, enabling the training of a Deep Neural Network and a linear regression model. These models are integrated into a simulator for designing aerodynamic-aware controllers, validated through flight simulations and balancing experiments on the iRonCub-Mk1 physical prototype.</p>

<p>Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Mashaal, Hatem Abou-Zeid</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification, angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations, such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data, achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification, respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves 94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs. 96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prathamesh Kokate, Mitali Sarnaik, Manavi Khopade, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity. Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length. Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent. This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long document classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangchen Li, Dimitrios Spatharakis, Saeid Ghafouri, Jiakun Fan, Hans Vandierendonck, Deepu John, Bo Ji, Dimitrios Nikolopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Regardless of the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a method that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: significantly increased system throughput, capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Xu, Jiajun Chai, Sicheng Li, Yuqian Fu, Yuanheng Zhu, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model, surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ebenezer Tarubinga, Jenifer Kalafatovich, Seong-Whan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling, which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Poompol Buathong, Peter I. Frazier</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks, where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead: choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over the original p-KGFN algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Venhoff, Ashkan Khakzar, Sonia Joseph, Philip Torr, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. Following the LiMBeR framework, we deliberately maintain a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. By keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuwan Bandara, Thivya Kandappu, Archan Misra</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: How does the threat of infectious disease influence sociality among generative agents? We used generative agent-based modeling (GABM), powered by large language models, to experimentally test hypotheses about the behavioral immune system. Across three simulation runs, generative agents who read news about an infectious disease outbreak showed significantly reduced social engagement compared to agents who received no such news, including lower attendance at a social gathering, fewer visits to third places (e.g., cafe, store, park), and fewer conversations throughout the town. In interview responses, agents explicitly attributed their behavioral changes to disease-avoidance motivations. A validity check further indicated that they could distinguish between infectious and noninfectious diseases, selectively reducing social engagement only when there was a risk of infection. Our findings highlight the potential of GABM as an experimental tool for exploring complex human social dynamics at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di He, Ajay Jaiswal, Songjun Tu, Li Shen, Ganzhao Yuan, Shiwei Liu, Lu Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

<p>Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinchan Li, Kenneth Chen, Changyue Su, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Qi Sun, Patsorn Sangkloy</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are well known for their ability to generate a high-fidelity image for an input prompt through an iterative denoising process. Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Helff, Ahmad Omar, Felix Friedrich, Wolfgang Stammer, Antonia W\"ust, Tim Woydt, Rupert Mitchell, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task, SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and (iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally, logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelin Xiao, Jia Gu, Song Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study methods for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission. One is based on a re-normalized Wald test, which is shown to be consistent as long as the number of distributed data blocks $K$ is of a smaller order of the minimum block sample size {and the level of heterogeneity is dense}. The second one is an extreme contrast test (ECT) based on the difference between the largest and smallest component-wise estimated parameters among data blocks. By introducing a sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising from the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much larger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT procedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the Wald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power under varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to present the implementation and validity of the proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Sengar, Ali Hariri, Daniel Probst, Patrick Barth, Pierre Vandergheynst</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p>
