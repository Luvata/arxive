<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Ouellette</p>
<p>Abstract: ARC-AGI is an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize out-of-distribution is a crucial quality. Under the program induction paradigm, we present a series of experiments that reveal the efficiency and generalization characteristics of various neurally-guided program induction approaches. The three paradigms we consider are Learning the grid space, Learning the program space, and Learning the transform space. We implement and experiment thoroughly on the first two, and retain the second one for ARC-AGI submission. After identifying the strengths and weaknesses of both of these approaches, we suggest the third as a potential solution, and run preliminary experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanyi Chen, Meng-Wen Su, Nafisa Mehjabin, Mary L. Cummings</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into vehicle navigation systems, understanding their path-planning capability is crucial. We tested three LLMs through six real-world path-planning scenarios in various settings and with various difficulties. Our experiments showed that all LLMs made numerous errors in all scenarios, revealing that they are unreliable path planners. We suggest that future work focus on implementing mechanisms for reality checks, enhancing model transparency, and developing smaller models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Ibrahim, Azam Asilian Bidgoli, Shahryar Rahnamayan, Kalyanmoy Deb</p>
<p>Abstract: As the interest in multi- and many-objective optimization algorithms grows, the performance comparison of these algorithms becomes increasingly important. A large number of performance indicators for multi-objective optimization algorithms have been introduced, each of which evaluates these algorithms based on a certain aspect. Therefore, assessing the quality of multi-objective results using multiple indicators is essential to guarantee that the evaluation considers all quality perspectives. This paper proposes a novel multi-metric comparison method to rank the performance of multi-/ many-objective optimization algorithms based on a set of performance indicators. We utilize the Pareto optimality concept (i.e., non-dominated sorting algorithm) to create the rank levels of algorithms by simultaneously considering multiple performance indicators as criteria/objectives. As a result, four different techniques are proposed to rank algorithms based on their contribution at each Pareto level. This method allows researchers to utilize a set of existing/newly developed performance metrics to adequately assess/rank multi-/many-objective algorithms. The proposed methods are scalable and can accommodate in its comprehensive scheme any newly introduced metric. The method was applied to rank 10 competing algorithms in the 2018 CEC competition solving 15 many-objective test problems. The Pareto-optimal ranking was conducted based on 10 well-known multi-objective performance indicators and the results were compared to the final ranks reported by the competition, which were based on the inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume indicator (HV) measures. The techniques suggested in this paper have broad applications in science and engineering, particularly in areas where multiple metrics are used for comparisons. Examples include machine learning and data mining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Zabaleta, Joel Lehman</p>
<p>Abstract: Do horror writers have worse childhoods than other writers? Though biographical details are known about many writers, quantitatively exploring such a qualitative hypothesis requires significant human effort, e.g. to sift through many biographies and interviews of writers and to iteratively search for quantitative features that reflect what is qualitatively of interest. This paper explores the potential to quickly prototype these kinds of hypotheses through (1) applying LLMs to estimate properties of concrete entities like specific people, companies, books, kinds of animals, and countries; (2) performing off-the-shelf analysis methods to reveal possible relationships among such properties (e.g. linear regression); and towards further automation, (3) applying LLMs to suggest the quantitative properties themselves that could help ground a particular qualitative hypothesis (e.g. number of adverse childhood events, in the context of the running example). The hope is to allow sifting through hypotheses more quickly through collaboration between human and machine. Our experiments highlight that indeed, LLMs can serve as useful estimators of tabular data about specific entities across a range of domains, and that such estimations improve with model scale. Further, initial experiments demonstrate the potential of LLMs to map a qualitative hypothesis of interest to relevant concrete variables that the LLM can then estimate. The conclusion is that LLMs offer intriguing potential to help illuminate scientifically interesting patterns latent within the internet-scale data they are trained upon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Fan, Jizhou Huang, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increased popularity of mobile devices, Web mapping services have become an indispensable tool in our daily lives. To provide user-satisfied services, such as location searches, the point of interest (POI) database is the fundamental infrastructure, as it archives multimodal information on billions of geographic locations closely related to people's lives, such as a shop or a bank. Therefore, verifying the correctness of a large-scale POI database is vital. To achieve this goal, many industrial companies adopt volunteered geographic information (VGI) platforms that enable thousands of crowdworkers and expert mappers to verify POIs seamlessly; but to do so, they have to spend millions of dollars every year. To save the tremendous labor costs, we devised DuMapper, an automatic system for large-scale POI verification with the multimodal street-view data at Baidu Maps. DuMapper takes the signboard image and the coordinates of a real-world place as input to generate a low-dimensional vector, which can be leveraged by ANN algorithms to conduct a more accurate search through billions of archived POIs in the database for verification within milliseconds. It can significantly increase the throughput of POI verification by $50$ times. DuMapper has already been deployed in production since \DuMPOnline, which dramatically improves the productivity and efficiency of POI verification at Baidu Maps. As of December 31, 2021, it has enacted over $405$ million iterations of POI verification within a 3.5-year period, representing an approximate workload of $800$ high-performance expert mappers.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18085">MONOPOLY: Learning to Price Public Facilities for Revaluing Private Properties with Large-Scale Urban Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Fan, Jizhou Huang, An Zhuo, Ying Li, Ping Li, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The value assessment of private properties is an attractive but challenging task which is widely concerned by a majority of people around the world. A prolonged topic among us is ``\textit{how much is my house worth?}''. To answer this question, most experienced agencies would like to price a property given the factors of its attributes as well as the demographics and the public facilities around it. However, no one knows the exact prices of these factors, especially the values of public facilities which may help assess private properties. In this paper, we introduce our newly launched project ``Monopoly'' (named after a classic board game) in which we propose a distributed approach for revaluing private properties by learning to price public facilities (such as hospitals etc.) with the large-scale urban data we have accumulated via Baidu Maps. To be specific, our method organizes many points of interest (POIs) into an undirected weighted graph and formulates multiple factors including the virtual prices of surrounding public facilities as adaptive variables to parallelly estimate the housing prices we know. Then the prices of both public facilities and private properties can be iteratively updated according to the loss of prediction until convergence. We have conducted extensive experiments with the large-scale urban data of several metropolises in China. Results show that our approach outperforms several mainstream methods with significant margins. Further insights from more in-depth discussions demonstrate that the ``Monopoly'' is an innovative application in the interdisciplinary field of business intelligence and urban computing, and it will be beneficial to tens of millions of our users for investments and to the governments for urban planning as well as taxation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mintaek Lim, Seokki Lee, Liyew Woletemaryam Abitew, Sundong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing artificial intelligence reasoning capabilities, focusing on logicality within the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Humans solve such visual reasoning tasks based on their observations and hypotheses, and they can explain their solutions with a proper reason. However, many previous approaches focused only on the grid transition and it is not enough for AI to provide reasonable and human-like solutions. By considering the human process of solving visual reasoning tasks, we have concluded that the thinking process is likely the abductive reasoning process. Thus, we propose a novel framework that symbolically represents the observed data into a knowledge graph and extracts core knowledge that can be used for solution generation. This information limits the solution search space and helps provide a reasonable mid-process. Our approach holds promise for improving AI performance on ARC tasks by effectively narrowing the solution space and providing logical solutions grounded in core knowledge extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Cheng, Zhi Mao, Ying Wang, Wen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dependency-aware task scheduling strategy for dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Specifically, different computation tasks of CAVs consisting of multiple dependency subtasks are judiciously assigned to nearby CAVs or the base station for promptly completing tasks. Therefore, we formulate a joint scheduling priority and subtask assignment optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the average task completion time. The problem aims at improving the long-term system performance, which is reformulated as a Markov decision process. To solve the problem, we further propose a diffusion-based reinforcement learning algorithm, named Synthetic DDQN based Subtasks Scheduling, which can make adaptive task scheduling decision in real time. A diffusion model-based synthetic experience replay is integrated into the reinforcement learning framework, which can generate sufficient synthetic data in experience replay buffer, thereby significantly accelerating convergence and improving sample efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on reducing task completion time, comparing to benchmark schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyun Zhang, Shilin He, Jiaxu Qian, Bowen Li, Liqun Li, Si Qin, Yu Kang, Minghua Ma, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18564">A Pipeline of Neural-Symbolic Integration to Enhance Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Wang, Kun Sun, Jonas Kuhn</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks. However, LLMs often struggle with spatial reasoning which is one essential part of reasoning and inference and requires understanding complex relationships between objects in space. This paper proposes a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) ASP (Answer Set Programming)-based symbolic reasoning, (2) LLM + ASP pipeline using DSPy, and (3) Fact + Logical rules. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline prompting methods, with accuracy increases of 40-50% on StepGame} dataset and 3-13% on the more complex SparQA dataset. The "LLM + ASP" pipeline achieves particularly strong results on the tasks of Finding Relations (FR) and Finding Block (FB) questions, though performance varies across different question types. The impressive results suggest that while neural-symbolic approaches offer promising directions for enhancing spatial reasoning in LLMs, their effectiveness depends heavily on the specific task characteristics and implementation strategies. We propose an integrated, simple yet effective set of strategies using a neural-symbolic pipeline to boost spatial reasoning abilities in LLMs. This pipeline and its strategies demonstrate strong and broader applicability to other reasoning domains in LLMs, such as temporal reasoning, deductive inference etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhang, Srishti Yadav, Fengze Han, Ekaterina Shutova</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Peng, Kang Liu, Jiaxi Shi, Jianchen Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) classification is a critical and challenging task in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, which plays a significant role in assisting patients with functional impairments to regain mobility. We present a novel multi-scale atrous convolutional neural network (CNN) model called EEG-dilated convolution network (DCNet) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the EEG-based MI classification tasks. We incorporate the $1\times1$ convolutional layer and utilize the multi-branch parallel atrous convolutional architecture in EEG-DCNet to capture the highly nonlinear characteristics and multi-scale features of the EEG signals. Moreover, we utilize the sliding window to enhance the temporal consistency and utilize the attension mechanism to improve the accuracy of recognizing user intentions. The experimental results (via the BCI-IV-2a ,BCI-IV-2b and the High-Gamma datasets) show that EEG-DCNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of classification accuracy and Kappa scores. Furthermore, since EEG-DCNet requires less number of parameters, the training efficiency and memory consumption are also improved.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Wang, Xu Cao, Yaojun Hu, Haochao Ying, James Matthew Rehg, Jimeng Sun, Jian Wu, Jintai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. Experimental results in anomaly detection, arrhythmia detection, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG signal analysis demonstrate that AnyECG learns common ECG knowledge from data and significantly outperforms cutting-edge methods in each respective task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeinab Nezami, Maryam Hafeez, Karim Djemame, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi</p>
<p>Abstract: 6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while bringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN (ORAN) and Network-in-a-Box strongly advocate the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, e.g., in provisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture, hardware testbeds and precise performance quantification of Large Language Models (LLMs) on off-the-shelf edge devices remains largely unexplored. This research investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single commodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate various LLMs, including small, medium and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular prompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing throughput, latency, accuracy and efficiency. Our findings indicate that CPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can effectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5 to 12 tokens per second with less than 50\% CPU and RAM usage. We conclude that GenAI on the edge offers localized inference in remote or bandwidth-constrained environments in 6G networks without reliance on cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Asgar Chandanwala, Srutakirti Bhowmik, Parna Chaudhury, Sheena Christabel Pravin</p>
<p>Abstract: Applications in behavioural research, human-computer interaction, and mental health depend on the ability to recognize emotions. In order to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) data, this work presents a hybrid quantum deep learning technique. Conventional EEG-based emotion recognition techniques are limited by noise and high-dimensional data complexity, which make feature extraction difficult. To tackle these issues, our method combines traditional deep learning classification with quantum-enhanced feature extraction. To identify important brain wave patterns, Bandpass filtering and Welch method are used as preprocessing techniques on EEG data. Intricate inter-band interactions that are essential for determining emotional states are captured by mapping frequency band power attributes (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) to quantum representations. Entanglement and rotation gates are used in a hybrid quantum circuit to maximize the model's sensitivity to EEG patterns associated with different emotions. Promising results from evaluation on a test dataset indicate the model's potential for accurate emotion recognition. The model will be extended for real-time applications and multi-class categorization in future study, which could improve EEG-based mental health screening instruments. This method offers a promising tool for applications in adaptive human-computer systems and mental health monitoring by showcasing the possibilities of fusing traditional deep learning with quantum processing for reliable, scalable emotion recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keshav Kumar, Ravindranath Chowdary</p>
<p>Abstract: Research papers are well structured documents. They have text, figures, equations, tables etc., to covey their ideas and findings. They are divided into sections like Introduction, Model, Experiments etc., which deal with different aspects of research. Characteristics like these set research papers apart from ordinary documents and allows us to significantly improve their summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel system, SlideSpwan, that takes PDF of a research document as an input and generates a quality presentation providing it's summary in a visual and concise fashion. The system first converts the PDF of the paper to an XML document that has the structural information about various elements. Then a machine learning model, trained on PS5K dataset and Aminer 9.5K Insights dataset (that we introduce), is used to predict salience of each sentence in the paper. Sentences for slides are selected using ILP and clustered based on their similarity with each cluster being given a suitable title. Finally a slide is generated by placing any graphical element referenced in the selected sentences next to them. Experiments on a test set of 650 pairs of papers and slides demonstrate that our system generates presentations with better quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadali Shakerdargah, Shan Lu, Chao Gao, Di Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of foundation models have revolutionized various fields, enabling unprecedented task accuracy and flexibility in computational linguistics, computer vision and other domains. Attention mechanism has become an essential component of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing correlations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity in memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based exact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for datacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and data locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention on resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and stringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact attention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by parallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector processing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling workloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to process tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two streams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to maximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O overhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable cache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation frameworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge computing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing unit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT, without affecting model output accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positively and efficiently transformed workflows in many domains. One such domain with significant potential for LLM integration is the Internet of Things (IoT), where this integration brings new opportunities for improved decision making and system interaction. In this paper, we explore the various roles of LLMs in IoT, with a focus on their reasoning capabilities. We show how LLM-IoT integration can facilitate advanced decision making and contextual understanding in a variety of IoT scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the integration of LLMs with edge, fog, and cloud computing paradigms, and show how this synergy can optimize resource utilization, enhance real-time processing, and provide scalable solutions for complex IoT applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study covering IoT-LLM integration between edge, fog, and cloud systems. Additionally, we propose a novel system model for industrial IoT applications that leverages LLM-based collective intelligence to enable predictive maintenance and condition monitoring. Finally, we highlight key challenges and open issues that provide insights for future research in the field of LLM-IoT integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregory Beylkin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a fast, robust algorithm for applying a matrix transfer function of a linear time invariant system (LTI) in time domain. Computing $L$ states of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) LTI appears to require $L$ matrix-vector multiplications. We demonstrate that, for any finite user-selected accuracy, the number of matrix-vector multiplications can be reduced to $\mathcal{O}\left(\log_{2}L\right)$ (within an $\mathcal{O}\left(L\right)$ algorithm). The algorithm uses an approximation of the rational transfer function in the z-domain by a matrix polynomial of degree $2^{N+1}-1$, where $N$ is chosen to achieve any user-selected accuracy. Importantly, using a cascade implementation in time domain, applying the transfer function requires only $N+1$ matrix-vector multiplications. We note that LTI systems are used in state space models (SSMs) for modeling long range dependencies where $L$ is large. In applications where the state matrix of LTI system is approximated by a structured matrix, the computational cost is further reduced. We briefly describe several structured approximations of matrices that can be used for such purpose.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the modern agricultural industry, technology plays a crucial role in the advancement of cultivation. To increase crop productivity, soil require some specific characteristics. For watermelon cultivation, soil needs to be sandy and of high temperature with proper irrigation. This research aims to design and implement an intelligent IoT-based soil characterization system for the watermelon field to measure the soil characteristics. IoT based developed system measures moisture, temperature, and pH of soil using different sensors, and the sensor data is uploaded to the cloud via Arduino and Raspberry Pi, from where users can obtain the data using mobile application and webpage developed for this system. To ensure the precision of the framework, this study includes the comparison between the readings of the soil parameters by the existing field soil meters, the values obtained from the sensors integrated IoT system, and data obtained from soil science laboratory. Excessive salinity in soil affects the watermelon yield. This paper proposes a model for the measurement of soil salinity based on soil resistivity. It establishes a relationship between soil salinity and soil resistivity from the data obtained in the laboratory using artificial neural network (ANN).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> KaiZhou Li, Jindong Gu, Xinchun Yu, Junjie Cao, Yansong Tang, Xiao-Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The security risks of AI-driven video editing have garnered significant attention. Although recent studies indicate that adding perturbations to images can protect them from malicious edits, directly applying image-based methods to perturb each frame in a video becomes ineffective, as video editing techniques leverage the consistency of inter-frame information to restore individually perturbed content. To address this challenge, we leverage the temporal consistency of video content to propose a straightforward and efficient, yet highly effective and broadly applicable approach, Universal Video Consistency Guard (UVCG). UVCG embeds the content of another video(target video) within a protected video by introducing continuous, imperceptible perturbations which has the ability to force the encoder of editing models to map continuous inputs to misaligned continuous outputs, thereby inhibiting the generation of videos consistent with the intended textual prompts. Additionally leveraging similarity in perturbations between adjacent frames, we improve the computational efficiency of perturbation generation by employing a perturbation-reuse strategy. We applied UVCG across various versions of Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) and assessed its effectiveness and generalizability across multiple LDM-based editing pipelines. The results confirm the effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency of our approach in safeguarding video content from unauthorized modifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Garber, Rohan Subramani, Linus Luu, Mark Bedaywi, Stuart Russell, Scott Emmons</p>
<p>Abstract: A wide variety of goals could cause an AI to disable its off switch because "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead" (Russell 2019). Prior theoretical work on this shutdown problem assumes that humans know everything that AIs do. In practice, however, humans have only limited information. Moreover, in many of the settings where the shutdown problem is most concerning, AIs might have vast amounts of private information. To capture these differences in knowledge, we introduce the Partially Observable Off-Switch Game (POSG), a game-theoretic model of the shutdown problem with asymmetric information. Unlike when the human has full observability, we find that in optimal play, even AI agents assisting perfectly rational humans sometimes avoid shutdown. As expected, increasing the amount of communication or information available always increases (or leaves unchanged) the agents' expected common payoff. But counterintuitively, introducing bounded communication can make the AI defer to the human less in optimal play even though communication mitigates information asymmetry. In particular, communication sometimes enables new optimal behavior requiring strategic AI deference to achieve outcomes that were previously inaccessible. Thus, designing safe artificial agents in the presence of asymmetric information requires careful consideration of the tradeoffs between maximizing payoffs (potentially myopically) and maintaining AIs' incentives to defer to humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijian Deng, Wentian Zhao, Yu-Jhe Li, Kun Wan, Daniel Miranda, Ajinkya Kale, Yapeng Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-improvement in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for enhancing their reliability and robustness. However, current methods often rely heavily on MLLMs themselves as judges, leading to high computational costs and potential pitfalls like reward hacking and model collapse. This paper introduces a novel, model-level judge-free self-improvement framework. Our approach employs a controlled feedback mechanism while eliminating the need for MLLMs in the verification loop. We generate preference learning pairs using a controllable hallucination mechanism and optimize data quality by leveraging lightweight, contrastive language-image encoders to evaluate and reverse pairs when necessary. Evaluations across public benchmarks and our newly introduced IC dataset designed to challenge hallucination control demonstrate that our model outperforms conventional techniques. We achieve superior precision and recall with significantly lower computational demands. This method offers an efficient pathway to scalable self-improvement in MLLMs, balancing performance gains with reduced resource requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tewodros Ayalew, Xiao Zhang, Kevin Yuanbo Wu, Tianchong Jiang, Michael Maire, Matthew R. Walter</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PROGRESSOR, a novel framework that learns a task-agnostic reward function from videos, enabling policy training through goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) without manual supervision. Underlying this reward is an estimate of the distribution over task progress as a function of the current, initial, and goal observations that is learned in a self-supervised fashion. Crucially, PROGRESSOR refines rewards adversarially during online RL training by pushing back predictions for out-of-distribution observations, to mitigate distribution shift inherent in non-expert observations. Utilizing this progress prediction as a dense reward together with an adversarial push-back, we show that PROGRESSOR enables robots to learn complex behaviors without any external supervision. Pretrained on large-scale egocentric human video from EPIC-KITCHENS, PROGRESSOR requires no fine-tuning on in-domain task-specific data for generalization to real-robot offline RL under noisy demonstrations, outperforming contemporary methods that provide dense visual reward for robotic learning. Our findings highlight the potential of PROGRESSOR for scalable robotic applications where direct action labels and task-specific rewards are not readily available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Liu, Xiaomei Zhang, Zhiyuan Ma, Xiangyu Zhu, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object reconstruction have been remarkable, yet most current 3D models rely heavily on existing 3D datasets. The scarcity of diverse 3D datasets results in limited generalization capabilities of 3D reconstruction models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for boosting 3D reconstruction with multi-view refinement (MVBoost) by generating pseudo-GT data. The key of MVBoost is combining the advantages of the high accuracy of the multi-view generation model and the consistency of the 3D reconstruction model to create a reliable data source. Specifically, given a single-view input image, we employ a multi-view diffusion model to generate multiple views, followed by a large 3D reconstruction model to produce consistent 3D data. MVBoost then adaptively refines these multi-view images, rendered from the consistent 3D data, to build a large-scale multi-view dataset for training a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model. Additionally, the input view optimization is designed to optimize the corresponding viewpoints based on the user's input image, ensuring that the most important viewpoint is accurately tailored to the user's needs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction results and robust generalization compared to prior works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Querying causal effects from time-series data is important across various fields, including healthcare, economics, climate science, and epidemiology. However, this task becomes complex in the existence of time-varying latent confounders, which affect both treatment and outcome variables over time and can introduce bias in causal effect estimation. Traditional instrumental variable (IV) methods are limited in addressing such complexities due to the need for predefined IVs or strong assumptions that do not hold in dynamic settings. To tackle these issues, we develop a novel Time-varying Conditional Instrumental Variables (CIV) for Debiasing causal effect estimation, referred to as TDCIV. TDCIV leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models to disentangle and learn the representations of time-varying CIV and its conditioning set from proxy variables without prior knowledge. Under the assumptions of the Markov property and availability of proxy variables, we theoretically establish the validity of these learned representations for addressing the biases from time-varying latent confounders, thus enabling accurate causal effect estimation. Our proposed TDCIV is the first to effectively learn time-varying CIV and its associated conditioning set without relying on domain-specific knowledge.</p>

Recognizing practical challenges in information collection due to privacy concerns, we further design a decentralized solution leveraging neural network optimization and a privacy-preserving information exchange protocol. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shape assembly, which aims to reassemble separate parts into a complete object, has gained significant interest in recent years. Existing methods primarily rely on networks to predict the poses of individual parts, but often fail to effectively capture the geometric interactions between the parts and their poses. In this paper, we present the Geometric Point Attention Transformer (GPAT), a network specifically designed to address the challenges of reasoning about geometric relationships. In the geometric point attention module, we integrate both global shape information and local pairwise geometric features, along with poses represented as rotation and translation vectors for each part. To enable iterative updates and dynamic reasoning, we introduce a geometric recycling scheme, where each prediction is fed into the next iteration for refinement. We evaluate our model on both the semantic and geometric assembly tasks, showing that it outperforms previous methods in absolute pose estimation, achieving accurate pose predictions and high alignment accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate 3D mapping in endoscopy enables quantitative, holistic lesion characterization within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, requiring reliable depth and pose estimation. However, endoscopy systems are monocular, and existing methods relying on synthetic datasets or complex models often lack generalizability in challenging endoscopic conditions. We propose a robust self-supervised monocular depth and pose estimation framework that incorporates a Generative Latent Bank and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The Generative Latent Bank leverages extensive depth scenes from natural images to condition the depth network, enhancing realism and robustness of depth predictions through latent feature priors. For pose estimation, we reformulate it within a VAE framework, treating pose transitions as latent variables to regularize scale, stabilize z-axis prominence, and improve x-y sensitivity. This dual refinement pipeline enables accurate depth and pose predictions, effectively addressing the GI tract's complex textures and lighting. Extensive evaluations on SimCol and EndoSLAM datasets confirm our framework's superior performance over published self-supervised methods in endoscopic depth and pose estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Selim Furkan Tekin, Fatih Ilhan, Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Zachary Yahn, Ling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment of pretrained LLMs using instruction-based datasets is critical for creating fine-tuned models that reflect human preference. A growing number of alignment-based fine-tuning algorithms and benchmarks emerged recently, fueling the efforts on effective alignments of pre-trained LLMs to ensure helpful, harmless, and honest answers from both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This paper tackles this problem by developing an alignment fusion approach, coined as $H^3$Fusion, with three unique characteristics. First, $H^3$Fusion ensembles multiple individually aligned LLMs to create a final fine-tuned alignment model with enhanced capabilities beyond those of individual models, delivering robust alignment through promoting helpful, harmless, honest fusion. Second, $H^3$Fusion leverages the mixture-of-experts (MoE) methodology in two steps. We first freeze the multi-head attention weights of each individual model while tuning the FFN layer during alignment fusion. Then we merge the aligned model weights with an expert router according to the type of input instruction and dynamically select a subset of experts that are best suited for producing the output response. Finally, we boost the performance of the resulting $H^3$3Fusion model by introducing gating loss and regularization terms. The former penalizes the selection errors of the expert-router, and the latter mediates the expert weights drifting during fine-tuning and dynamically adjusts the fusion behavior of the resulting model by canalizing the activations on the experts. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that $H^3$3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest from two aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by $11.37\%$, and it provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by $13.77\%$.

To address structural data scarcity, we present CrossDesign, a domain-adaptive framework that leverages pretrained protein language models (PPLMs). By aligning protein structures with sequences, CrossDesign transfers pretrained knowledge to structure models, overcoming the limitations of limited structural data. The framework combines autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) states in its encoder-decoder architecture, applying it to enzyme datasets and pan-proteins. Experimental results highlight CrossDesign's superior performance and robustness, especially with out-of-domain enzymes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangbin Zheng, Qianhui Xu, Ruichen Xia, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying T-cell receptors (TCRs) that interact with antigenic peptides provides the technical basis for developing vaccines and immunotherapies. The emergent deep learning methods excel at learning antigen binding patterns from known TCRs but struggle with novel or sparsely represented antigens. However, binding specificity for unseen antigens or exogenous peptides is critical. We introduce a domain-adaptive peptide-agnostic learning framework DapPep for universal TCR-antigen binding affinity prediction to address this challenge. The lightweight self-attention architecture combines a pre-trained protein language model with an inner-loop self-supervised regime to enable robust TCR-peptide representations. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DapPep consistently outperforms existing tools, showcasing robust generalization capability, especially for data-scarce settings and unseen peptides. Moreover, DapPep proves effective in challenging clinical tasks such as sorting reactive T cells in tumor neoantigen therapy and identifying key positions in 3D structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin W. Thomas, Rom Parnichkun, Alexander Amini, Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Xing, Qian Yu, Chuang Wang, Haitao Zhou, Jing Zhang, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVG) synthesis has demonstrated significant potential in domains such as iconography and sketching. However, SVGs generated from existing Text-to-SVG methods often lack editability and exhibit deficiencies in visual quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method to address these limitations. To improve the diversity of output SVGs, we present a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach. VPSD addresses over-saturation issues in existing methods and enhances sample diversity. A pre-trained reward model is incorporated to re-weight vector particles, improving aesthetic appeal and enabling faster convergence. Additionally, we design a novel adaptive vector primitives control strategy, which allows for the dynamic adjustment of the number of primitives, thereby enhancing the presentation of graphic details. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity. We also show that our new method supports up to six distinct vector styles, capable of generating high-quality vector assets suitable for stylized vector design and poster design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Gray Widder, Sireesh Gururaja, Lucy Suchman</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of unprecedented U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budgets, this paper examines the recent history of DoD funding for academic research in algorithmically based warfighting. We draw from a corpus of DoD grant solicitations from 2007 to 2023, focusing on those addressed to researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Considering the implications of DoD funding for academic research, the paper proceeds through three analytic sections. In the first, we offer a critical examination of the distinction between basic and applied research, showing how funding calls framed as basic research nonetheless enlist researchers in a war fighting agenda. In the second, we offer a diachronic analysis of the corpus, showing how a 'one small problem' caveat, in which affirmation of progress in military technologies is qualified by acknowledgement of outstanding problems, becomes justification for additional investments in research. We close with an analysis of DoD aspirations based on a subset of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant solicitations for the use of AI in battlefield applications. Taken together, we argue that grant solicitations work as a vehicle for the mutual enlistment of DoD funding agencies and the academic AI research community in setting research agendas. The trope of basic research in this context offers shelter from significant moral questions that military applications of one's research would raise, by obscuring the connections that implicate researchers in U.S. militarism.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research efforts focus on reducing the computational and memory overheads of Large Language Models (LLMs) to make them feasible on resource-constrained devices. Despite advancements in compression techniques, non-linear operators like Softmax and Layernorm remain bottlenecks due to their sensitivity to quantization.

Our method achieves up to three orders of magnitude improvement in the energy-delay product compared to A100 and RTX3090 GPUs, making LLMs more deployable without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Alves, Bruno Pereira Cipriano</p>
<p>Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard in computer science (CS) education is expected to be profound. Students now have the power to generate code solutions for a wide array of programming assignments. For first-year students, this may be particularly problematic since the foundational skills are still in development and an over-reliance on generative AI tools can hinder their ability to grasp essential programming concepts. This paper analyzes the prompts used by 69 freshmen undergraduate students to solve a certain programming problem within a project assignment, without giving them prior prompt training. We also present the rules of the exercise that motivated the prompts, designed to foster critical thinking skills during the interaction. Despite using unsophisticated prompting techniques, our findings suggest that the majority of students successfully leveraged GPT, incorporating the suggested solutions into their projects. Additionally, half of the students demonstrated the ability to exercise judgment in selecting from multiple GPT-generated solutions, showcasing the development of their critical thinking skills in evaluating AI-generated code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Ahmad, Mehdi Kermanshah, Kevin Leahy, Zachary Serlin, Ho Chit Siu, Makai Mann, Cristian-Ioan Vasile, Roberto Tron, Calin Belta</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of delayed rewards in reinforcement learning (RL). While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as a leading Policy Gradient method, its performance can degrade under delayed rewards. We introduce two key enhancements to PPO: a hybrid policy architecture that combines an offline policy (trained on expert demonstrations) with an online PPO policy, and a reward shaping mechanism using Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL). The hybrid architecture leverages offline data throughout training while maintaining PPO's theoretical guarantees. Building on the monotonic improvement framework of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), we prove that our approach ensures improvement over both the offline policy and previous iterations, with a bounded performance gap of $(2\varsigma\gamma\alpha^2)/(1-\gamma)^2$, where $\alpha$ is the mixing parameter, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\varsigma$ bounds the expected advantage. Additionally, we prove that our TWTL-based reward shaping preserves the optimal policy of the original problem. TWTL enables formal translation of temporal objectives into immediate feedback signals that guide learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on an inverted pendulum and a lunar lander environments, showing improvements in both learning speed and final performance compared to standard PPO and offline-only approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeovane Honorio Alves, Radu State, Cinthia Obladen de Almendra Freitas, Jean Paul Barddal</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era of information overload, manually annotating the vast and growing corpus of documents and scholarly papers is increasingly impractical. Automated keyphrase extraction addresses this challenge by identifying representative terms within texts. However, most existing methods focus on short documents (up to 512 tokens), leaving a gap in processing long-context documents. In this paper, we introduce LongKey, a novel framework for extracting keyphrases from lengthy documents, which uses an encoder-based language model to capture extended text intricacies. LongKey uses a max-pooling embedder to enhance keyphrase candidate representation. Validated on the comprehensive LDKP datasets and six diverse, unseen datasets, LongKey consistently outperforms existing unsupervised and language model-based keyphrase extraction methods. Our findings demonstrate LongKey's versatility and superior performance, marking an advancement in keyphrase extraction for varied text lengths and domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kalina P. Slavkova, Melanie Traughber, Oliver Chen, Robert Bakos, Shayna Goldstein, Dan Harms, Bradley J. Erickson, Khan M. Siddiqui</p>
<p>Abstract: Technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of large vision language models (LVLMs) that are trained on millions of paired image and text samples. Subsequent research efforts have demonstrated great potential of LVLMs to achieve high performance in medical imaging use cases (e.g., radiology report generation), but there remain barriers that hinder the ability to deploy these solutions broadly. These include the cost of extensive computational requirements for developing large scale models, expertise in the development of sophisticated AI models, and the difficulty in accessing substantially large, high-quality datasets that adequately represent the population in which the LVLM solution is to be deployed. The HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform addresses these barriers by providing powerful computational infrastructure, a suite of foundation models on top of which developers can fine-tune for their specific use cases, and a robust quality management system that sets a standard for evaluating fine-tuned models for deployment in clinical settings. The HOPPR Platform has access to millions of imaging studies and text reports sourced from hundreds of imaging centers from diverse populations to pretrain foundation models and enable use case-specific cohorts for fine-tuning. All data are deidentified and securely stored for HIPAA compliance. Additionally, developers can securely host models on the HOPPR platform and access them via an API to make inferences using these models within established clinical workflows. With the Medical-Grade Platform, HOPPR's mission is to expedite the deployment of LVLM solutions for medical imaging and ultimately optimize radiologist's workflows and meet the growing demands of the field.</p>

Traditional feature extraction and deep learning methods are used to obtain helpful information from the data and enhance the performance of the different machine learning models employed for the leaf area index prediction. The results showed that deep learning based feature extraction is more effective than traditional methods. The new approach is a significant improvement over old methods, offering a faster, non-destructive, and cost-effective leaf area index calculation, which enhances precision agriculture practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Weitekamp, Erik Harpstead, Kenneth Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: AI2T is an interactively teachable AI for authoring intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Authors tutor AI2T by providing a few step-by-step solutions and then grading AI2T's own problem-solving attempts. From just 20-30 minutes of interactive training, AI2T can induce robust rules for step-by-step solution tracking (i.e., model-tracing). As AI2T learns it can accurately estimate its certainty of performing correctly on unseen problem steps using STAND: a self-aware precondition learning algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods like XGBoost. Our user study shows that authors can use STAND's certainty heuristic to estimate when AI2T has been trained on enough diverse problems to induce correct and complete model-tracing programs. AI2T-induced programs are more reliable than hallucination-prone LLMs and prior authoring-by-tutoring approaches. With its self-aware induction of hierarchical rules, AI2T offers a path toward trustable data-efficient authoring-by-tutoring for complex ITSs that normally require as many as 200-300 hours of programming per hour of instruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: While the Web has become a worldwide platform for communication, hackers and hacktivists share their ideology and communicate with members on the "Dark Web" - the reverse of the Web. Currently, the problems of information overload and difficulty to obtain a comprehensive picture of hackers and cyber-attackers hinder the effective analysis of predicting their activities on the Web. Also, there are currently more objects connected to the internet than there are people in the world and this gap will continue to grow as more and more objects gain ability to directly interface with the Internet. Many technical communities are vigorously pursuing research topics that contribute to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we have proposed a novel methodology for collecting and analyzing the Dark Web information to identify websites of hackers from the Web sea, and how this information can help us in predicting IoT vulnerabilities. This methodology incorporates information collection, analysis, visualization techniques, and exploits some of the IoT devices. Through this research we want to contribute to the existing literature on cyber-security that could potentially guide in both policy-making and intelligence research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shu Wan, Reepal Shah, Qi Deng, John Sabo, Huan Liu, K. Sel\c{c}uk</p>
<p>Abstract: Streamflow plays an essential role in the sustainable planning and management of national water resources. Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods. By effectively integrating river flow graphs with STGNNs, this research offers a novel approach to streamflow prediction, showcasing the potential of combining advanced neural network techniques with domain-specific knowledge for enhanced performance in hydrologic modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has revolutionized content generation, offering transformative capabilities for improving language coherence, readability, and overall quality. This manuscript explores the application of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research approaches to evaluate the performance of GenAI models in enhancing scientific writing. Using a hypothetical use case involving a collaborative medical imaging manuscript, we demonstrate how each method provides unique insights into the impact of GenAI. Qualitative methods gather in-depth feedback from expert reviewers, analyzing their responses using thematic analysis tools to capture nuanced improvements and identify limitations. Quantitative approaches employ automated metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and readability scores, as well as user surveys, to objectively measure improvements in coherence, fluency, and structure. Mixed-methods research integrates these strengths, combining statistical evaluations with detailed qualitative insights to provide a comprehensive assessment. These research methods enable quantifying improvement levels in GenAI-generated content, addressing critical aspects of linguistic quality and technical accuracy. They also offer a robust framework for benchmarking GenAI tools against traditional editing processes, ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of these technologies. By leveraging these methodologies, researchers can evaluate the performance boost driven by GenAI, refine its applications, and guide its responsible adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare and scientific research. This work underscores the importance of rigorous evaluation frameworks for advancing trust and innovation in GenAI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D content from text prompts remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the limited size, diversity, and annotation depth of the existing datasets. To address this, we introduce MARVEL-40M+, an extensive dataset with 40 million text annotations for over 8.9 million 3D assets aggregated from seven major 3D datasets. Our contribution is a novel multi-stage annotation pipeline that integrates open-source pretrained multi-view VLMs and LLMs to automatically produce multi-level descriptions, ranging from detailed (150-200 words) to concise semantic tags (10-20 words). This structure supports both fine-grained 3D reconstruction and rapid prototyping. Furthermore, we incorporate human metadata from source datasets into our annotation pipeline to add domain-specific information in our annotation and reduce VLM hallucinations. Additionally, we develop MARVEL-FX3D, a two-stage text-to-3D pipeline. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with our annotations and use a pretrained image-to-3D network to generate 3D textured meshes within 15s. Extensive evaluations show that MARVEL-40M+ significantly outperforms existing datasets in annotation quality and linguistic diversity, achieving win rates of 72.41% by GPT-4 and 73.40% by human evaluators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of cerebral blood flow is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Traditional computational methods, however, often incur significant computational costs, limiting their practicality in real-time clinical applications. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) to predict blood flow and pressure in previously unseen cerebral vascular network structures that were not included in training data. The GNN was developed using clinical datasets from patients with stenosis, featuring complex and abnormal vascular geometries. Additionally, the GNN model was trained on data incorporating a wide range of inflow conditions, vessel topologies, and network connectivities to enhance its generalization capability. The approach achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.727 for pressure and 0.824 for flow rate, with sufficient training data. These findings demonstrate the potential of the GNN for real-time cerebrovascular diagnostics, particularly in handling intricate and pathological vascular networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The forest serves as the most significant terrestrial carbon stock mechanism, effectively reducing atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations and mitigating climate change. Remote sensing provides high data accuracy and enables large-scale observations. Optical images facilitate long-term monitoring, which is crucial for future carbon stock estimation studies. This study focuses on Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, utilizing GF-1 WFV satellite imagery. The KD-VGG and KD-UNet modules were introduced for initial feature extraction, and the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM) was proposed. The results showed: (1) The VGG module improved initial feature extraction, improving accuracy, and reducing inference time with optimized model parameters. (2) The Cross-attention + MLPs module enabled effective feature fusion, establishing critical relationships between global and local features, achieving high-accuracy estimation. (3) The IIDM model, a novel contribution, demonstrated the highest estimation accuracy with an RMSE of 12.17\%, significantly improving by 41.69\% to 42.33\% compared to the regression model. In carbon stock estimation, the generative model excelled in extracting deeper features, significantly outperforming other models, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-generated content in quantitative remote sensing. The 16-meter resolution estimates provide a robust basis for tailoring forest carbon sink regulations, enhancing regional carbon stock management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Bai, Ying Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Model selection/optimization in conformal inference is challenging, since it may break the exchangeability between labeled and unlabeled data. We study this problem in the context of conformal selection, which uses conformal p-values to select ``interesting'' instances with large unobserved labels from a pool of unlabeled data, while controlling the FDR in finite sample. For validity, existing solutions require the model choice to be independent of the data used to construct the p-values and calibrate the selection set. However, when presented with many model choices and limited labeled data, it is desirable to (i) select the best model in a data-driven manner, and (ii) mitigate power loss due to sample splitting.
  This paper presents OptCS, a general framework that allows valid statistical testing (selection) after flexible data-driven model optimization. We introduce general conditions under which OptCS constructs valid conformal p-values despite substantial data reuse and handles complex p-value dependencies to maintain finite-sample FDR control via a novel multiple testing procedure. We instantiate this general recipe to propose three FDR-controlling procedures, each optimizing the models differently: (i) selecting the most powerful one among multiple pre-trained candidate models, (ii) using all data for model fitting without sample splitting, and (iii) combining full-sample model fitting and selection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods via simulation studies and real applications in drug discovery and alignment of large language models in radiology report generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxuan Li, Yao Liu, Ruoyu Wang, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: As the significance of understanding the cause-and-effect relationships among variables increases in the development of modern systems and algorithms, learning causality from observational data has become a preferred and efficient approach over conducting randomized control trials. However, purely observational data could be insufficient to reconstruct the true causal graph. Consequently, many researchers tried to utilise some form of prior knowledge to improve causal discovery process. In this context, the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the costly acquisition of prior expert knowledge. In this work, we further explore the potential of using LLMs to enhance causal discovery approaches, particularly focusing on score-based methods, and we propose a general framework to utilise the capacity of not only one but multiple LLMs to augment the discovery process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song-Jiang Lai, Tsun-Hin Cheung, Ka-Chun Fung, Tian-Shan Liu, Kin-Man Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, computer vision tasks have seen significant improvements, making two-stream neural networks a popular focus for video based action recognition. Traditional models using RGB and optical flow streams achieve strong performance but at a high computational cost. To address this, we introduce a representation flow algorithm to replace the optical flow branch in the egocentric action recognition model, enabling end-to-end training while reducing computational cost and prediction time. Our model, designed for egocentric action recognition, uses class activation maps (CAMs) to improve accuracy and ConvLSTM for spatio temporal encoding with spatial attention. When evaluated on the GTEA61, EGTEA GAZE+, and HMDB datasets, our model matches the accuracy of the original model on GTEA61 and exceeds it by 0.65% and 0.84% on EGTEA GAZE+ and HMDB, respectively. Prediction runtimes are significantly reduced to 0.1881s, 0.1503s, and 0.1459s, compared to the original model's 101.6795s, 25.3799s, and 203.9958s. Ablation studies were also conducted to study the impact of different parameters on model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song-Jiang Lai, Tsun-Hin Cheung, Ka-Chun Fung, Kai-wen Xue, Kin-Man Lama</p>
<p>Abstract: In the research area of image super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models are favored for their global spatial modeling and shifting window attention mechanism. However, existing methods often limit self-attention to non overlapping windows to cut costs and ignore the useful information that exists across channels. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, the Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer (HAAT), designed to better leverage feature information. HAAT is constructed by integrating Swin-Dense-Residual-Connected Blocks (SDRCB) with Hybrid Grid Attention Blocks (HGAB). SDRCB expands the receptive field while maintaining a streamlined architecture, resulting in enhanced performance. HGAB incorporates channel attention, sparse attention, and window attention to improve nonlocal feature fusion and achieve more visually compelling results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HAAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingsen Du, Yanxuan Wei, Xiangwei Zheng, Cun Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, time series classification has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and hundreds of methods have been proposed. However, these methods often ignore the spatial correlations among dimensions and the local correlations among features. To address this issue, the causal and local correlations based network (CaLoNet) is proposed in this study for multivariate time series classification. First, pairwise spatial correlations between dimensions are modeled using causality modeling to obtain the graph structure. Then, a relationship extraction network is used to fuse local correlations to obtain long-term dependency features. Finally, the graph structure and long-term dependency features are integrated into the graph neural network. Experiments on the UEA datasets show that CaLoNet can obtain competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinchen Wang, Pengfei Gao, Xiangxin Meng, Chao Peng, Ruida Hu, Yun Lin, Cuiyun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: In software maintenance, bug reproduction is essential for effective fault localization and repair. Manually writing reproduction scripts is a time-consuming task with high requirements for developers. Hence, automation of bug reproduction has increasingly attracted attention from researchers and practitioners. However, the existing studies on bug reproduction are generally limited to specific bug types such as program crashes, and hard to be applied to general bug reproduction. In this paper, considering the superior performance of agent-based methods in code intelligence tasks, we focus on designing an agent-based framework for the task. Directly employing agents would lead to limited bug reproduction performance, due to entangled subtasks, lengthy retrieved context, and unregulated actions. To mitigate the challenges, we propose an Automated gEneral buG reproductIon Scripts generation framework, named AEGIS, which is the first agent-based framework for the task. AEGIS mainly contains two modules: (1) A concise context construction module, which aims to guide the code agent in extracting structured information from issue descriptions, identifying issue-related code with detailed explanations, and integrating these elements to construct the concise context; (2) A FSM-based multi-feedback optimization module to further regulate the behavior of the code agent within the finite state machine (FSM), ensuring a controlled and efficient script generation process based on multi-dimensional feedback. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark dataset show that AEGIS outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 23.0% in F->P metric. In addition, the bug reproduction scripts generated by AEGIS can improve the relative resolved rate of Agentless by 12.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donggoo Kang, Dasol Jeong, Hyunmin Lee, Sangwoo Park, Hasil Park, Sunkyu Kwon, Yeongjoon Kim, Joonki Paik</p>
<p>Abstract: The Large Vision Language Model (VLM) has recently addressed remarkable progress in bridging two fundamental modalities. VLM, trained by a sufficiently large dataset, exhibits a comprehensive understanding of both visual and linguistic to perform diverse tasks. To distill this knowledge accurately, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach that explicitly utilizes VLM as an objective function form for the Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection task (\textbf{VLM-HOI}). Specifically, we propose a method that quantifies the similarity of the predicted HOI triplet using the Image-Text matching technique. We represent HOI triplets linguistically to fully utilize the language comprehension of VLMs, which are more suitable than CLIP models due to their localization and object-centric nature. This matching score is used as an objective for contrastive optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first utilization of VLM language abilities for HOI detection. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art HOI detection accuracy on benchmarks. We believe integrating VLMs into HOI detection represents important progress towards more advanced and interpretable analysis of human-object interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingsen Du, Meng Chen, Yongjian Li, Cun Ji, Shoushui Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anmol Dwivedi, Ali Tajer, Santiago Paternain, Nurali Virani</p>
<p>Abstract: Electricity grid's resiliency and climate change strongly impact one another due to an array of technical and policy-related decisions that impact both. This paper introduces a physics-informed machine learning-based framework to enhance grid's resiliency. Specifically, when encountering disruptive events, this paper designs remedial control actions to prevent blackouts. The proposed Physics-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PG-RL) framework determines effective real-time remedial line-switching actions, considering their impact on power balance, system security, and grid reliability. To identify an effective blackout mitigation policy, PG-RL leverages power-flow sensitivity factors to guide the RL exploration during agent training. Comprehensive evaluations using the Grid2Op platform demonstrate that incorporating physical signals into RL significantly improves resource utilization within electric grids and achieves better blackout mitigation policies - both of which are critical in addressing climate change.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized image generation has been significantly advanced, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images. However, existing methods often struggle with generating images of multiple people due to occlusions and fail to accurately personalize full-body shapes. In this paper, we propose PersonaCraft, a novel approach that combines diffusion models with 3D human modeling to address these limitations. Our method effectively manages occlusions by incorporating 3D-aware pose conditioning with SMPLx-ControlNet and accurately personalizes human full-body shapes through SMPLx fitting. Additionally, PersonaCraft enables user-defined body shape adjustments, adding flexibility for individual body customization. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PersonaCraft in generating high-quality, realistic images of multiple individuals while resolving occlusion issues, thus establishing a new standard for multi-person personalized image synthesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieshan Chen, Zhen Wang, Jiamou Sun, Wenbo Zou, Zhenchang Xing, Qinghua Lu, Qing Huang, Xiwei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile apps are essential in daily life, yet they often employ dark patterns, such as visual tricks to highlight certain options or linguistic tactics to nag users into making purchases, to manipulate user behavior. Current research mainly uses manual methods to detect dark patterns, a process that is time-consuming and struggles to keep pace with continually updating and emerging apps. While some studies targeted at automated detection, they are constrained to static patterns and still necessitate manual app exploration. To bridge these gaps, we present AppRay, an innovative system that seamlessly blends task-oriented app exploration with automated dark pattern detection, reducing manual efforts. Our approach consists of two steps: First, we harness the commonsense knowledge of large language models for targeted app exploration, supplemented by traditional random exploration to capture a broader range of UI states. Second, we developed a static and dynamic dark pattern detector powered by a contrastive learning-based multi-label classifier and a rule-based refiner to perform detection. We contributed two datasets, AppRay-Dark and AppRay-Light, with 2,185 unique deceptive patterns (including 149 dynamic instances) across 18 types from 876 UIs and 871 benign UIs. These datasets cover both static and dynamic dark patterns while preserving UI relationships. Experimental results confirm that AppRay can efficiently explore the app and identify a wide range of dark patterns with great performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving, due in part to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for training sophisticated reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel approach that leverages LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which are then used to synthesize a vast array of high-quality problems and solutions. Leveraging TDG, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a dataset comprising over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems--each accompanied by code-based and natural language solutions--with the potential to generate an effectively unlimited number more. This dataset alleviates the scarcity of large-scale mathematical datasets and serves as a valuable resource for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs in mathematical reasoning. Our method not only enables the generation of virtually infinite data but also elevates data augmentation to a new level by using GPT-4 for meta-template generation, ensuring diverse and high-quality problem structures.

<p>Abstract: Full-duplex multimodal large language models (LLMs) provide a unified framework for addressing diverse speech understanding and generation tasks, enabling more natural and seamless human-machine conversations. Unlike traditional modularised conversational AI systems, which separate speech recognition, understanding, and text-to-speech generation into distinct components, multimodal LLMs operate as single end-to-end models. This streamlined design eliminates error propagation across components and fully leverages the rich non-verbal information embedded in input speech signals. We introduce SALMONN-omni, a codec-free, full-duplex speech understanding and generation model capable of simultaneously listening to its own generated speech and background sounds while speaking. To support this capability, we propose a novel duplex spoken dialogue framework incorporating a ``thinking'' mechanism that facilitates asynchronous text and speech generation relying on embeddings instead of codecs (quantized speech and audio tokens). Experimental results demonstrate SALMONN-omni's versatility across a broad range of streaming speech tasks, including speech recognition, speech enhancement, and spoken question answering. Additionally, SALMONN-omni excels at managing turn-taking, barge-in, and echo cancellation scenarios, establishing its potential as a robust prototype for full-duplex conversational AI systems. To the best of our knowledge, SALMONN-omni is the first codec-free model of its kind. A full technical report along with model checkpoints will be released soon.</p>

The QNN model was applied using different optimizers, learning rates, noise on the circuit components, and weight initializations were considered, but the QNN persistently ran into the dead neuron problem. Thus, the QNN was compared only by accraucy and loss, and it was shown that with the Adam optimizer, the model has the best performance, however, still less than the QSVC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purpose: Endoscopic surgical environments present challenges for dissection zone segmentation due to unclear boundaries between tissue types, leading to segmentation errors where models misidentify or overlook edges. This study aims to provide precise dissection zone suggestions during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedures, enhancing ESD safety.
  Methods: We propose the Prompted-based Dissection Zone Segmentation (PDZSeg) model, designed to leverage diverse visual prompts such as scribbles and bounding boxes. By overlaying these prompts onto images and fine-tuning a foundational model on a specialized dataset, our approach improves segmentation performance and user experience through flexible input methods.
  Results: The PDZSeg model was validated using three experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, variability in visual prompt availability, and robustness assessment. Using the ESD-DZSeg dataset, results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation approaches. This is the first study to integrate visual prompt design into dissection zone segmentation.
  Conclusion: The PDZSeg model effectively utilizes visual prompts to enhance segmentation performance and user experience, supported by the novel ESD-DZSeg dataset as a benchmark for dissection zone segmentation in ESD. Our work establishes a foundation for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation tasks, including image editing and video creation, representing a good understanding of the physical world. On the other line, diffusion models have also shown promise in robotic control tasks by denoising actions, known as diffusion policy. Although the diffusion generative model and diffusion policy exhibit distinct capabilities--image prediction and robotic action, respectively--they technically follow a similar denoising process. In robotic tasks, the ability to predict future images and generate actions is highly correlated since they share the same underlying dynamics of the physical world. Building on this insight, we introduce PAD, a novel visual policy learning framework that unifies image Prediction and robot Action within a joint Denoising process. Specifically, PAD utilizes Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to seamlessly integrate images and robot states, enabling the simultaneous prediction of future images and robot actions. Additionally, PAD supports co-training on both robotic demonstrations and large-scale video datasets and can be easily extended to other robotic modalities, such as depth images. PAD outperforms previous methods, achieving a significant 26.3% relative improvement on the full Metaworld benchmark, by utilizing a single text-conditioned visual policy within a data-efficient imitation learning setting. Furthermore, PAD demonstrates superior generalization to unseen tasks in real-world robot manipulation settings with 28.0% success rate increase compared to the strongest baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie-Jing Shao, Hao-Ran Hao, Xiao-Wen Yang, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent learning-to-imitation methods have shown promising results in planning via imitating within the observation-action space. However, their ability in open environments remains constrained, particularly in long-horizon tasks. In contrast, traditional symbolic planning excels in long-horizon tasks through logical reasoning over human-defined symbolic spaces but struggles to handle observations beyond symbolic states, such as high-dimensional visual inputs encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we draw inspiration from abductive learning and introduce a novel framework \textbf{AB}ductive \textbf{I}mitation \textbf{L}earning (ABIL) that integrates the benefits of data-driven learning and symbolic-based reasoning, enabling long-horizon planning. Specifically, we employ abductive reasoning to understand the demonstrations in symbolic space and design the principles of sequential consistency to resolve the conflicts between perception and reasoning. ABIL generates predicate candidates to facilitate the perception from raw observations to symbolic space without laborious predicate annotations, providing a groundwork for symbolic planning. With the symbolic understanding, we further develop a policy ensemble whose base policies are built with different logical objectives and managed through symbolic reasoning. Experiments show that our proposal successfully understands the observations with the task-relevant symbolics to assist the imitation learning. Importantly, ABIL demonstrates significantly improved data efficiency and generalization across various long-horizon tasks, highlighting it as a promising solution for long-horizon planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhao Li, Zhengkang Xiang, Joseph West, Kourosh Khoshelham</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional object detection methods operate under the closed-set assumption, where models can only detect a fixed number of objects predefined in the training set. Recent works on open vocabulary object detection (OVD) enable the detection of objects defined by an unbounded vocabulary, which reduces the cost of training models for specific tasks. However, OVD heavily relies on accurate prompts provided by an ''oracle'', which limits their use in critical applications such as driving scene perception. OVD models tend to misclassify near-out-of-distribution (NOOD) objects that have similar semantics to known classes, and ignore far-out-of-distribution (FOOD) objects. To address theses limitations, we propose a framework that enables OVD models to operate in open world settings, by identifying and incrementally learning novel objects. To detect FOOD objects, we propose Open World Embedding Learning (OWEL) and introduce the concept of Pseudo Unknown Embedding which infers the location of unknown classes in a continuous semantic space based on the information of known classes. We also propose Multi-Scale Contrastive Anchor Learning (MSCAL), which enables the identification of misclassified unknown objects by promoting the intra-class consistency of object embeddings at different scales. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in common open world object detection and autonomous driving benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shimin Chen, Xiaohan Lan, Yitian Yuan, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal large language models (LMMs), particularly in vision-language tasks. However, existing video-language models often overlook precise temporal localization and struggle with videos of varying lengths. We introduce TimeMarker, a versatile Video-LLM designed for high-quality dialogue based on video content, emphasizing temporal localization. TimeMarker integrates Temporal Separator Tokens to enhance temporal awareness, accurately marking specific moments within videos. It employs the AnyLength mechanism for dynamic frame sampling and adaptive token merging, enabling effective handling of both short and long videos. Additionally, TimeMarker utilizes diverse datasets, including further transformed temporal-related video QA datasets, to bolster its temporal understanding capabilities. Image and interleaved data are also employed to further enhance the model's semantic perception ability. Evaluations demonstrate that TimeMarker achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, excelling in both short and long video categories.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aladin Djuhera, Vlad C. Andrei, Amin Seffo, Holger Boche, Walid Saad</p>
<p>Abstract: Path planning is a complex problem for many practical applications, particularly in robotics. Existing algorithms, however, are exhaustive in nature and become increasingly complex when additional side constraints are incorporated alongside distance minimization. In this paper, a novel approach using vision language models (VLMs) is proposed for enabling path planning in complex wireless-aware environments. To this end, insights from a digital twin (DT) with real-world wireless ray tracing data are explored in order to guarantee an average path gain threshold while minimizing the trajectory length. First, traditional approaches such as A* are compared to several wireless-aware extensions, and an optimal iterative dynamic programming approach (DP-WA*) is derived, which fully takes into account all path gains and distance metrics within the DT. On the basis of these baselines, the role of VLMs as an alternative assistant for path planning is investigated, and a strategic chain-of-thought tasking (SCoTT) approach is proposed. SCoTT divides the complex planning task into several subproblems and solves each with advanced CoT prompting. Results show that SCoTT achieves very close average path gains compared to DP-WA* while at the same time yielding consistently shorter path lengths. The results also show that VLMs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by efficiently reducing the algorithm's search space and thus saving up to 62\% in execution time. This work underscores the potential of VLMs in future digital systems as capable assistants for solving complex tasks, while enhancing user interaction and accelerating rapid prototyping under diverse wireless constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aladin Djuhera, Vlad C. Andrei, Mohsen Pourghasemian, Haris Gacanin, Holger Boche, Walid Saad</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zak Buzzard, Konstantin Hemker, Nikola Simidjievski, Mateja Jamnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) has seen significant research progress in recent years, with applications ranging across important diagnostic and prognostic tasks such as survival or cancer subtype prediction. Many state-of-the-art models process the entire slide - which may be as large as $150,000 \times 150,000$ pixels - as a bag of many patches, the size of which necessitates computationally cheap feature aggregation methods. However, a large proportion of these patches are uninformative, such as those containing only healthy or adipose tissue, adding significant noise and size to the bag. We propose Pathology Transformer with Hierarchical Selection (PATHS), a novel top-down method for hierarchical weakly supervised representation learning on slide-level tasks in computational pathology. PATHS is inspired by the cross-magnification manner in which a human pathologist examines a slide, recursively filtering patches at each magnification level to a small subset relevant to the diagnosis. Our method overcomes the complications of processing the entire slide, enabling quadratic self-attention and providing a simple interpretable measure of region importance. We apply PATHS to five datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and achieve superior performance on slide-level prediction tasks when compared to previous methods, despite processing only a small proportion of the slide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhay Kumar Pathak, Mrityunjay Chaubey, Manjari Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease refers to any critical condition that impacts the heart. Because heart diseases can be life-threatening. Researchers are focusing on designing smart systems to accurately diagnose them based on electronic health data, with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Heart disease classification using machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Na\"ive Bayes(NB), Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs) are often hindered by overfitting. These ML algorithms need extensive hyperparameter tuning. Random Search offers a faster, and, more efficient exploration of hyperparameter space, but, it may overlook optimal regions. Grid Search, though exhaustive, but, it is computationally expensive and inefficient, particularly with high-dimensional data. To address these limitations, Randomized-Grid Search, a novel hybrid optimization method is proposed that combines the global exploration strengths of Random Search with the focused, and, exhaustive search of Grid Search in the most promising regions. This hybrid approach efficiently balances exploration and exploitation. The proposed model optimizes the hyperparameter for Decision Tree model. The proposed model is applied to UCI heart disease dataset for classification. It enhances model performance, provides improved accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Randomized-Grid Search outperforms traditional methods by significant margins. The proposed model provides a more effective solution for machine learning applications in healthcare diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhouxing Shi, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning Lyapunov-stable neural controllers which provably satisfy the Lyapunov asymptotic stability condition within a region-of-attraction. Compared to previous works which commonly used counterexample guided training on this task, we develop a new and generally formulated certified training framework named CT-BaB, and we optimize for differentiable verified bounds, to produce verification-friendly models. In order to handle the relatively large region-of-interest, we propose a novel framework of training-time branch-and-bound to dynamically maintain a training dataset of subregions throughout training, such that the hardest subregions are iteratively split into smaller ones whose verified bounds can be computed more tightly to ease the training. We demonstrate that our new training framework can produce models which can be more efficiently verified at test time. On the largest 2D quadrotor dynamical system, verification for our model is more than 5X faster compared to the baseline, while our size of region-of-attraction is 16X larger than the baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with domain-specific challenges, such as specialized terminology and localized regulations. Existing financial LLMs, like FinGPT and BloombergGPT, lack support for the Thai financial domain. We developed a Thai Financial LLM using the Investment Consultant (IC) exam dataset from the Stock Exchange of Thailand. To address dataset limitations, we applied data augmentation, ReLoRA for efficient training, Continued Pretraining (CPT) for domain knowledge, and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA) for fine-tuning. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) simulated exam scenarios, while Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) refined the model using feedback. The model achieved scores of 72%, 72%, and 84% on IC exam levels P1, P2, and P3, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in Thai financial advisory tasks and its potential for specialized applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weight initialization significantly impacts the convergence and performance of neural networks. While traditional methods like Xavier and Kaiming initialization are widely used, they often fall short for spiking neural networks (SNNs), which have distinct requirements compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs).
  To address this, we introduce \textbf{IKUN}, a variance-stabilizing initialization method integrated with surrogate gradient functions, specifically designed for SNNs. \textbf{IKUN} stabilizes signal propagation, accelerates convergence, and enhances generalization. Experiments show \textbf{IKUN} improves training efficiency by up to \textbf{50\%}, achieving \textbf{95\%} training accuracy and \textbf{91\%} generalization accuracy.
  Hessian analysis reveals that \textbf{IKUN}-trained models converge to flatter minima, characterized by Hessian eigenvalues near zero on the positive side, promoting better generalization.

<p>Abstract: Purpose: Analyzing noninvasive longitudinal and multimodal data using artificial intelligence could potentially transform immunotherapy for cancer patients, paving the way towards precision medicine. Methods: In this study, we integrated pre- and on-treatment blood measurements, prescribed medications and CT-based volumes of organs from a large pan-cancer cohort of 694 patients treated with immunotherapy to predict short and long-term overall survival. By leveraging a combination of recent developments, different variants of our extended multimodal transformer-based simple temporal attention (MMTSimTA) network were trained end-to-end to predict mortality at three, six, nine and twelve months. These models were also compared to baseline methods incorporating intermediate and late fusion based integration methods. Results: The strongest prognostic performance was demonstrated using the extended transformer-based multimodal model with area under the curves (AUCs) of $0.84 \pm $0.04, $0.83 \pm $0.02, $0.82 \pm $0.02, $0.81 \pm $0.03 for 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month survival prediction, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that analyzing integrated early treatment data has potential for predicting survival of immunotherapy patients. Integrating complementary noninvasive modalities into a jointly trained model, using our extended transformer-based architecture, demonstrated an improved multimodal prognostic performance, especially in short term survival prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effectively manipulating articulated objects in household scenarios is a crucial step toward achieving general embodied artificial intelligence. Mainstream research in 3D vision has primarily focused on manipulation through depth perception and pose detection. However, in real-world environments, these methods often face challenges due to imperfect depth perception, such as with transparent lids and reflective handles. Moreover, they generally lack the diversity in part-based interactions required for flexible and adaptable manipulation. To address these challenges, we introduced a large-scale part-centric dataset for articulated object manipulation that features both photo-realistic material randomizations and detailed annotations of part-oriented, scene-level actionable interaction poses. We evaluated the effectiveness of our dataset by integrating it with several state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation and interaction pose prediction. Additionally, we proposed a novel modular framework that delivers superior and robust performance for generalizable articulated object manipulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the performance of depth perception and actionable interaction pose prediction in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Su, Feng Liu, Yanchuan Chang, Egemen Tanin, Majid Sarvi, Jianzhong Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting is an important problem in the operation and optimisation of transportation systems. State-of-the-art solutions train machine learning models by minimising the mean forecasting errors on the training data. The trained models often favour periodic events instead of aperiodic ones in their prediction results, as periodic events often prevail in the training data. While offering critical optimisation opportunities, aperiodic events such as traffic incidents may be missed by the existing models. To address this issue, we propose DualCast -- a model framework to enhance the learning capability of traffic forecasting models, especially for aperiodic events. DualCast takes a dual-branch architecture, to disentangle traffic signals into two types, one reflecting intrinsic {spatial-temporal} patterns and the other reflecting external environment contexts including aperiodic events. We further propose a cross-time attention mechanism, to capture high-order spatial-temporal relationships from both periodic and aperiodic patterns. DualCast is versatile. We integrate it with recent traffic forecasting models, consistently reducing their forecasting errors by up to 9.6% on multiple real datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to end-to-end speech translation (ST) based on aligning frozen pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) models via a small connector module (Q-Former, our Subsampler-Transformer Encoder). This connector bridges the gap between the speech and text modalities, transforming ASR encoder embeddings into the latent representation space of the MT encoder while being the only part of the system optimized during training. Experiments are conducted on the How2 English-Portuguese dataset as we investigate the alignment approach in a small-scale scenario focusing on ST. While keeping the size of the connector module constant and small in comparison ( < 5% of the size of the larger aligned models), increasing the size and capability of the foundation ASR and MT models universally improves translation results. We also find that the connectors can serve as domain adapters for the foundation MT models, significantly improving translation performance in the aligned ST setting. We conclude that this approach represents a viable and scalable approach to training end-to-end ST systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants face unique challenges for process control due to their complex dynamics, slow time constants, and stochastic delays in observations and actions. These characteristics make conventional control methods, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers, suboptimal for achieving efficient phosphorus removal, a critical component of wastewater treatment to ensure environmental sustainability. This study addresses these challenges using a novel deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, integrated with a custom simulator designed to model the delayed feedback inherent in wastewater treatment plants. The simulator incorporates Long Short-Term Memory networks for accurate multi-step state predictions, enabling realistic training scenarios. To account for the stochastic nature of delays, agents were trained under three delay scenarios: no delay, constant delay, and random delay. The results demonstrate that incorporating random delays into the reinforcement learning framework significantly improves phosphorus removal efficiency while reducing operational costs. Specifically, the delay-aware agent achieved 36% reduction in phosphorus emissions, 55% higher reward, 77% lower target deviation from the regulatory limit, and 9% lower total costs than traditional control methods in the simulated environment. These findings underscore the potential of reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of conventional control strategies in wastewater treatment, providing an adaptive and cost-effective solution for phosphorus removal.</p>

<p>Abstract: CT report generation (CTRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports for 3D volumes, relieving clinicians' workload and improving patient care. Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced Tansformer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention effectively synthesizes diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views. Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) retrieves the most similar reports based on the query volume to incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure. Furthermore, instead of traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with learnable nonlinear activation functions as the fundamental building blocks of both modules to better capture intricate diagnostic patterns in CT interpretation. Extensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548K dataset demonstrate that our method outpaces prior state-of-the-art models across all metrics.</p>

This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging the machine speech chain framework to enable continual learning in ASR using gradient episodic memory (GEM).

Our experiments, conducted on the LJ Speech dataset, demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional fine-tuning and multitask learning approaches, achieving a substantial error rate reduction while maintaining high performance across varying noise conditions. We showed the potential of our semi-supervised machine speech chain approach for effective and efficient continual learning in speech recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Eduardo Pessoa, Cristovao Freitas Iglesias Jr, Claudio Miceli</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing resilient Internet of Things (IoT) systems requires i) identification of IoT Critical Objects (ICOs) such as services, devices, and resources, ii) threat analysis, and iii) mitigation strategy selection. However, the traditional process for designing resilient IoT systems is still manual, leading to inefficiencies and increased risks. In addition, while tools such as ChatGPT could support this manual and highly error-prone process, their use raises concerns over data privacy, inconsistent outputs, and internet dependence. Therefore, we propose RITA, an automated, open-source framework that uses a fine-tuned RoBERTa-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify ICOs from IoT requirement documents, correlate threats, and recommend countermeasures. RITA operates entirely offline and can be deployed on-site, safeguarding sensitive information and delivering consistent outputs that enhance standardization. In our empirical evaluation, RITA outperformed ChatGPT in four of seven ICO categories, particularly in actuator, sensor, network resource, and service identification, using both human-annotated and ChatGPT-generated test data. These findings indicate that RITA can improve resilient IoT design by effectively supporting key security operations, offering a practical solution for developing robust IoT architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Zayene, Jannik Endres, Albias Havolli, Charles Corbi\`ere, Salim Cherkaoui, Alexandre Kontouli, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite considerable progress in stereo depth estimation, omnidirectional imaging remains underexplored, mainly due to the lack of appropriate data. We introduce Helvipad, a real-world dataset for omnidirectional stereo depth estimation, consisting of 40K frames from video sequences across diverse environments, including crowded indoor and outdoor scenes with diverse lighting conditions. Collected using two 360{\deg} cameras in a top-bottom setup and a LiDAR sensor, the dataset includes accurate depth and disparity labels by projecting 3D point clouds onto equirectangular images. Additionally, we provide an augmented training set with a significantly increased label density by using depth completion. We benchmark leading stereo depth estimation models for both standard and omnidirectional images. The results show that while recent stereo methods perform decently, a significant challenge persists in accurately estimating depth in omnidirectional imaging. To address this, we introduce necessary adaptations to stereo models, achieving improved performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized Federal learning(PFL) allows clients to cooperatively train a personalized model without disclosing their private dataset. However, PFL suffers from Non-IID, heterogeneous devices, lack of fairness, and unclear contribution which urgently need the interpretability of deep learning model to overcome these challenges. These challenges proposed new demands for interpretability. Low cost, privacy, and detailed information. There is no current interpretability method satisfying them. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability method \emph{FreqX} by introducing Signal Processing and Information Theory. Our experiments show that the explanation results of FreqX contain both attribution information and concept information. FreqX runs at least 10 times faster than the baselines which contain concept information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riza Velioglu, Petra Bevandic, Robin Chan, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF), a novel task focused on generating standardized garment images from single photos of clothed individuals. Unlike traditional Virtual Try-On (VTON), which digitally dresses models, VTOFF aims to extract a canonical garment image, posing unique challenges in capturing garment shape, texture, and intricate patterns. This well-defined target makes VTOFF particularly effective for evaluating reconstruction fidelity in generative models. We present TryOffDiff, a model that adapts Stable Diffusion with SigLIP-based visual conditioning to ensure high fidelity and detail retention. Experiments on a modified VITON-HD dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods based on pose transfer and virtual try-on with fewer pre- and post-processing steps. Our analysis reveals that traditional image generation metrics inadequately assess reconstruction quality, prompting us to rely on DISTS for more accurate evaluation. Our results highlight the potential of VTOFF to enhance product imagery in e-commerce applications, advance generative model evaluation, and inspire future work on high-fidelity reconstruction.

We found that ChatGPT tends to overuse the lemma "we" as well as nouns and commas. On the other hand, the generated speeches employ less verbs and include, in mean, longer sentences. Even when imposing a given style to ChatGPT, the resulting speech remains distinct from messages written by the target author. Moreover, ChatGPT opts for a neutral tone with mainly positive emotional expressions and symbolic terms (e.g., freedom, nation). Finally, we show that the GPT's style exposes distinct features compared to real presidential addresses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</p>

The main focus of this study is to analyze the written style of one LLM called ChatGPT by comparing its generated messages with those of the recent French presidents.

Considering some words, one can observe that ChatGPT tends to overuse "to must" (devoir), "to continue" or the lemma "we" (nous). Moreover, GPT underuses the auxiliary verb "to be" (^etre), or the modal verbs "to will" (vouloir) or "to have to" (falloir).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mattia Giovanni Spina, Edoardo Scalzo, Floriano De Rango, Francesca Guerriero, Antonio Iera</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of programmable data plane (PDP) and in-network computing (INC) paradigms paves the way for the development of network devices (switches, network interface cards, etc.) capable of performing advanced computing tasks. This allows to execute algorithms of various nature, including machine learning ones, within the network itself to support user and network services. In particular, this paper delves into the issue of implementing in-network learning models to support distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS). It proposes a model that optimally distributes the IDS workload, resulting from the subdivision of a "Strong Learner" (SL) model into lighter distributed "Weak Learner" (WL) models, among data plane devices; the objective is to ensure complete network security without excessively burdening their normal operations. Furthermore, a meta-heuristic approach is proposed to reduce the long computational time required by the exact solution provided by the mathematical model, and its performance is evaluated. The analysis conducted and the results obtained demonstrate the enormous potential of the proposed new approach to the creation of intelligent data planes that effectively act as a first line of defense against cyber attacks, with minimal additional workload on network devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Xu, Hanyin Cheng, Chenjuan Guo, Hongfan Gao, Jilin Hu, Sean Bin Yang, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing effective path representations has become increasingly essential across various fields within intelligent transportation. Although pre-trained path representation learning models have shown improved performance, they predominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data, i.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features associated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to human understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can provide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and generalization. However, variations in information granularity impede the semantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based paths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses substantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning Framework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by integrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the alignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment strategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths with their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both detailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the heterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based cross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse information across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path. This is an extended version of the paper accepted by KDD 2025.</p>

<p>Abstract: Selection bias poses a critical challenge for fairness in machine learning, as models trained on data that is less representative of the population might exhibit undesirable behavior for underrepresented profiles. Semi-supervised learning strategies like self-training can mitigate selection bias by incorporating unlabeled data into model training to gain further insight into the distribution of the population. However, conventional self-training seeks to include high-confidence data samples, which may reinforce existing model bias and compromise effectiveness. We propose Metric-DST, a diversity-guided self-training strategy that leverages metric learning and its implicit embedding space to counter confidence-based bias through the inclusion of more diverse samples. Metric-DST learned more robust models in the presence of selection bias for generated and real-world datasets with induced bias, as well as a molecular biology prediction task with intrinsic bias. The Metric-DST learning strategy offers a flexible and widely applicable solution to mitigate selection bias and enhance fairness of machine learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Kirstein, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of meeting summaries generated by natural language generation (NLG) systems is hard to measure automatically. Established metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore have a relatively low correlation with human judgments and fail to capture nuanced errors. Recent studies suggest using large language models (LLMs), which have the benefit of better context understanding and adaption of error definitions without training on a large number of human preference judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluators risk masking errors and can only serve as a weak proxy, leaving human evaluation the gold standard despite being costly and hard to compare across studies. In this work, we present MESA, an LLM-based framework employing a three-step assessment of individual error types, multi-agent discussion for decision refinement, and feedback-based self-training to refine error definition understanding and alignment with human judgment. We show that MESA's components enable thorough error detection, consistent rating, and adaptability to custom error guidelines. Using GPT-4o as its backbone, MESA achieves mid to high Point-Biserial correlation with human judgment in error detection and mid Spearman and Kendall correlation in reflecting error impact on summary quality, on average 0.25 higher than previous methods. The framework's flexibility in adapting to custom error guidelines makes it suitable for various tasks with limited human-labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Pasini, Javier Nistal, Stefan Lattner, George Fazekas</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models are typically applied to sequences of discrete tokens, but recent research indicates that generating sequences of continuous embeddings in an autoregressive manner is also feasible. However, such Continuous Autoregressive Models (CAMs) can suffer from a decline in generation quality over extended sequences due to error accumulation during inference. We introduce a novel method to address this issue by injecting random noise into the input embeddings during training. This procedure makes the model robust against varying error levels at inference. We further reduce error accumulation through an inference procedure that introduces low-level noise. Experiments on musical audio generation show that CAM substantially outperforms existing autoregressive and non-autoregressive approaches while preserving audio quality over extended sequences. This work paves the way for generating continuous embeddings in a purely autoregressive setting, opening new possibilities for real-time and interactive generative applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Fernando N\'u\~nez, Jamie Arjona, Javier B\'ejar</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models need a sufficient amount of data in order to be able to find the hidden patterns in it. It is the purpose of generative modeling to learn the data distribution, thus allowing us to sample more data and augment the original dataset. In the context of physiological data, and more specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, given its sensitive nature and expensive data collection, we can exploit the benefits of generative models in order to enlarge existing datasets and improve downstream tasks, in our case, classification of heart rhythm.
  In this work, we explore the usefulness of synthetic data generated with different generative models from Deep Learning namely Diffweave, Time-Diffusion and Time-VQVAE in order to obtain better classification results for two open source multivariate ECG datasets. Moreover, we also investigate the effects of transfer learning, by fine-tuning a synthetically pre-trained model and then progressively adding increasing proportions of real data. We conclude that although the synthetic samples resemble the real ones, the classification improvement when simply augmenting the real dataset is barely noticeable on individual datasets, but when both datasets are merged the results show an increase across all metrics for the classifiers when using synthetic samples as augmented data. From the fine-tuning results the Time-VQVAE generative model has shown to be superior to the others but not powerful enough to achieve results close to a classifier trained with real data only. In addition, methods and metrics for measuring closeness between synthetic data and the real one have been explored as a side effect of the main research questions of this study.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) has become an important technique in accelerating the inference speed of large language models. Conventional SD methods employ a fixed draft length, which ignores the token generation difficulty across tasks. Consequently, in this paper, we address such an issue and introduce SVIP - a difficulty-aware dynamic draft length policy for speculative decoding systems. Based on a theoretical lower bound of draft token acceptance rate and its inference-time approximation, SVIP adaptively determines the lengths of draft sequences based on the entropy of each draft token distribution. Experimental results on mainstream SD benchmarks and frameworks demonstrate the superior performance of SVIP, achieving up to 20\% walltime speedup on SpecBench over baseline SD methods and 60\% speedup on MT-Bench for long-form generation of up to 8K tokens. Moreover, SVIP is totally training-free and compatible with any existing SD methods that generate draft tokens autoregressively. Experimental results also show that SVIP yields consistent walltime improvement on top of GliDe & CaPE and EAGLE-2.</p>

<p>Abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt valid geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic tasks for peptide drug development are still lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce PepHAR, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring correct peptide structures. By combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables de novo peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of PepHAR in computational peptide binder design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuze Wang, Aoran Hu, Ji Qi, Yang Liu, Chao Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately mapping large-scale cropland is crucial for agricultural production management and planning. Currently, the combination of remote sensing data and deep learning techniques has shown outstanding performance in cropland mapping. However, those approaches require massive precise labels, which are labor-intensive. To reduce the label cost, this study presented a weakly supervised framework considering multi-temporal information for large-scale cropland mapping. Specifically, we extract high-quality labels according to their consistency among global land cover (GLC) products to construct the supervised learning signal. On the one hand, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by the model's over-trust of remaining errors in high-quality labels, we encode the similarity/aggregation of cropland in the visual/spatial domain to construct the unsupervised learning signal, and take it as the regularization term to constrain the supervised part. On the other hand, to sufficiently leverage the plentiful information in the samples without high-quality labels, we also incorporate the unsupervised learning signal in these samples, enriching the diversity of the feature space. After that, to capture the phenological features of croplands, we introduce dense satellite image time series (SITS) to extend the proposed framework in the temporal dimension. We also visualized the high dimensional phenological features to uncover how multi-temporal information benefits cropland extraction, and assessed the method's robustness under conditions of data scarcity. The proposed framework has been experimentally validated for strong adaptability across three study areas (Hunan Province, Southeast France, and Kansas) in large-scale cropland mapping, and the internal mechanism and temporal generalizability are also investigated.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Delicado, Cristian Pach\'on-Garc\'ia</p>
<p>Abstract: The presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our society is increasing, which brings with it the need to understand the behaviour of AI mechanisms, including machine learning predictive algorithms fed with tabular data, text, or images, among other types of data. This work focuses on interpretability of predictive models based on functional data. Designing interpretability methods for functional data models implies working with a set of features whose size is infinite. In the context of scalar on function regression, we propose an interpretability method based on the Shapley value for continuous games, a mathematical formulation that allows to fairly distribute a global payoff among a continuous set players. The method is illustrated through a set of experiments with simulated and real data sets. The open source Python package ShapleyFDA is also presented.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nurshat Fateh Ali, Md. Mahdi Mohtasim, Shakil Mosharrof, T. Gopi Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: This research presents and compares multiple approaches to automate the generation of literature reviews using several Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM). The ever-increasing number of research articles provides a huge challenge for manual literature review. It has resulted in an increased demand for automation. Developing a system capable of automatically generating the literature reviews from only the PDF files as input is the primary objective of this research work. The effectiveness of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies, such as the frequency-based method (spaCy), the transformer model (Simple T5), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Large Language Model (GPT-3.5-turbo), is evaluated to meet the primary objective. The SciTLDR dataset is chosen for this research experiment and three distinct techniques are utilized to implement three different systems for auto-generating the literature reviews. The ROUGE scores are used for the evaluation of all three systems. Based on the evaluation, the Large Language Model GPT-3.5-turbo achieved the highest ROUGE-1 score, 0.364. The transformer model comes in second place and spaCy is at the last position. Finally, a graphical user interface is created for the best system based on the large language model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Tang, Zhishuai Liu, Pan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Process (DRMDP) is a popular framework for addressing dynamics shift in reinforcement learning by learning policies robust to the worst-case transition dynamics within a constrained set. However, solving its dual optimization oracle poses significant challenges, limiting theoretical analysis and computational efficiency. The recently proposed Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) replaces the uncertainty set constraint with a regularization term on the value function, offering improved scalability and theoretical insights. Yet, existing RRMDP methods rely on unstructured regularization, often leading to overly conservative policies by considering transitions that are unrealistic. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear robust regularized Markov decision process ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces a linear latent structure into both transition kernels and regularization. For the offline RL setting, where an agent learns robust policies from a pre-collected dataset in the nominal environment, we develop a family of algorithms, Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI), employing linear function approximation and $f$-divergence based regularization terms on transition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the suboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, showing these bounds depend on how well the dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy under robustly admissible transitions. This term is further shown to be fundamental to $d$-RRMDPs via information-theoretic lower bounds. Finally, numerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and is computationally more efficient than methods for constrained DRMDPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhang, Jiayi Shen, Congfeng Cao, Gaole Dai, Shiji Zhou, Qizhe Zhang, Shanghang Zhang, Ekaterina Shutova</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancing towards generalist agents necessitates the concurrent processing of multiple tasks using a unified model, thereby underscoring the growing significance of simultaneous model training on multiple downstream tasks. A common issue in multi-task learning is the occurrence of gradient conflict, which leads to potential competition among different tasks during joint training. This competition often results in improvements in one task at the expense of deterioration in another. Although several optimization methods have been developed to address this issue by manipulating task gradients for better task balancing, they cannot decrease the incidence of gradient conflict. In this paper, we systematically investigate the occurrence of gradient conflict across different methods and propose a strategy to reduce such conflicts through sparse training (ST), wherein only a portion of the model's parameters are updated during training while keeping the rest unchanged. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ST effectively mitigates conflicting gradients and leads to superior performance. Furthermore, ST can be easily integrated with gradient manipulation techniques, thus enhancing their effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengqu Cai, Eric Chan, Yunzhi Zhang, Leonidas Guibas, Jiajun Wu, Gordon Wetzstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models produce impressive results but are frustrating tools for artists who desire fine-grained control. For example, a common use case is to create images of a specific instance in novel contexts, i.e., "identity-preserving generation". This setting, along with many other tasks (e.g., relighting), is a natural fit for image+text-conditional generative models. However, there is insufficient high-quality paired data to train such a model directly. We propose Diffusion Self-Distillation, a method for using a pre-trained text-to-image model to generate its own dataset for text-conditioned image-to-image tasks. We first leverage a text-to-image diffusion model's in-context generation ability to create grids of images and curate a large paired dataset with the help of a Visual-Language Model. We then fine-tune the text-to-image model into a text+image-to-image model using the curated paired dataset. We demonstrate that Diffusion Self-Distillation outperforms existing zero-shot methods and is competitive with per-instance tuning techniques on a wide range of identity-preservation generation tasks, without requiring test-time optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Odense, Artur d'Avila Garcez</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of neuro-symbolic AI aims to benefit from the combination of neural networks and symbolic systems. A cornerstone of the field is the translation or encoding of symbolic knowledge into neural networks. Although many neuro-symbolic methods and approaches have been proposed, and with a large increase in recent years, no common definition of encoding exists that can enable a precise, theoretical comparison of neuro-symbolic methods. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a semantic framework for neuro-symbolic AI. We start by providing a formal definition of semantic encoding, specifying the components and conditions under which a knowledge-base can be encoded correctly by a neural network. We then show that many neuro-symbolic approaches are accounted for by this definition. We provide a number of examples and correspondence proofs applying the proposed framework to the neural encoding of various forms of knowledge representation. Many, at first sight disparate, neuro-symbolic methods, are shown to fall within the proposed formalization. This is expected to provide guidance to future neuro-symbolic encodings by placing them in the broader context of semantic encodings of entire families of existing neuro-symbolic systems. The paper hopes to help initiate a discussion around the provision of a theory for neuro-symbolic AI and a semantics for deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglin Zhou, Yifu Yuan, Shaofu Yang, Jianye Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) provides a promising solution for complex tasks with sparse rewards of intelligent agents, which uses a hierarchical framework that divides tasks into subgoals and completes them sequentially. However, current methods struggle to find suitable subgoals for ensuring a stable learning process. Without additional guidance, it is impractical to rely solely on exploration or heuristics methods to determine subgoals in a large goal space. To address the issue, We propose a general hierarchical reinforcement learning framework incorporating human feedback and dynamic distance constraints (MENTOR). MENTOR acts as a "mentor", incorporating human feedback into high-level policy learning, to find better subgoals. As for low-level policy, MENTOR designs a dual policy for exploration-exploitation decoupling respectively to stabilize the training. Furthermore, although humans can simply break down tasks into subgoals to guide the right learning direction, subgoals that are too difficult or too easy can still hinder downstream learning efficiency. We propose the Dynamic Distance Constraint (DDC) mechanism dynamically adjusting the space of optional subgoals. Thus MENTOR can generate subgoals matching the low-level policy learning process from easy to hard. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR uses a small amount of human feedback to achieve significant improvement in complex tasks with sparse rewards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Structural pruning has emerged as a promising approach for producing more efficient models. Nevertheless, the community suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, leaving the progress in this area not fully comprehended.To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive benchmark, termed PruningBench, for structural pruning. PruningBench showcases the following three characteristics: 1) PruningBench employs a unified and consistent framework for evaluating the effectiveness of diverse structural pruning techniques; 2) PruningBench systematically evaluates 16 existing pruning methods, encompassing a wide array of models (e.g., CNNs and ViTs) and tasks (e.g., classification and detection); 3) PruningBench provides easily implementable interfaces to facilitate the implementation of future pruning methods, and enables the subsequent researchers to incorporate their work into our leaderboards. We provide an online pruning platform http://pruning.vipazoo.cn for customizing pruning tasks and reproducing all results in this paper.

<p>Abstract: Job shop scheduling problems (JSSPs) represent a critical and challenging class of combinatorial optimization problems. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve JSSPs, albeit lacking a systematic survey of the relevant literature. This paper aims to thoroughly review prevailing GNN methods for different types of JSSPs and the closely related flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), especially those leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities. We hope this survey can motivate and inspire innovative approaches for more powerful GNN-based approaches in tackling JSSPs and other scheduling problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Zuo, Yongqi Ding, Wenwei Luo, Mengmeng Jing, Xianlong Tian, Kunshan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyue Ou, Frank F. Xu, Aman Madaan, Jiarui Liu, Robert Lo, Abishek Sridhar, Sudipta Sengupta, Dan Roth, Graham Neubig, Shuyan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs can now act as autonomous agents that interact with digital environments and complete specific objectives (e.g., arranging an online meeting). However, accuracy is still far from satisfactory, partly due to a lack of large-scale, direct demonstrations for digital tasks. Obtaining supervised data from humans is costly, and automatic data collection through exploration or reinforcement learning relies on complex environmental and content setup, resulting in datasets that lack comprehensive coverage of various scenarios. On the other hand, there is abundant knowledge that may indirectly assist task completion, such as online tutorials that were created for human consumption. In this work, we present Synatra, an approach that effectively transforms this indirect knowledge into direct supervision at scale. We define different types of indirect knowledge, and carefully study the available sources to obtain it, methods to encode the structure of direct demonstrations, and finally methods to transform indirect knowledge into direct demonstrations. We use 100k such synthetically-created demonstrations to finetune a 7B CodeLlama, and demonstrate that the resulting agent surpasses all comparably sized models on three web-based task benchmarks Mind2Web, MiniWoB++ and WebArena, as well as surpassing GPT-3.5 on WebArena and Mind2Web. In addition, while synthetic demonstrations prove to be only 3% the cost of human demonstrations (at $0.031 each), we show that the synthetic demonstrations can be more effective than an identical number of human demonstrations collected from limited domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creativity is the ability to produce novel, useful, and surprising ideas, and has been widely studied as a crucial aspect of human cognition. Machine creativity on the other hand has been a long-standing challenge. With the rise of advanced generative AI, there has been renewed interest and debate regarding AI's creative capabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to revisit the state of creativity in AI and identify key progresses and remaining challenges. In this work, we survey leading works studying the creative capabilities of AI systems, focusing on creative problem-solving, linguistic, artistic, and scientific creativity. Our review suggests that while the latest AI models are largely capable of producing linguistically and artistically creative outputs such as poems, images, and musical pieces, they struggle with tasks that require creative problem-solving, abstract thinking and compositionality and their generations suffer from a lack of diversity, originality, long-range incoherence and hallucinations. We also discuss key questions concerning copyright and authorship issues with generative models. Furthermore, we highlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation of creativity that is process-driven and considers several dimensions of creativity. Finally, we propose future research directions to improve the creativity of AI outputs, drawing inspiration from cognitive science and psychology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) accurately predict election outcomes? While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains, including healthcare, legal analysis, and creative tasks, their ability to forecast elections remains unknown. Election prediction poses unique challenges, such as limited voter-level data, rapidly changing political landscapes, and the need to model complex human behavior. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-step reasoning framework designed for political analysis. Our approach is validated on real-world data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 and 2020, as well as synthetic personas generated by the leading machine learning framework, offering scalable datasets for voter behavior modeling. To capture temporal dynamics, we incorporate candidates' policy positions and biographical details, ensuring that the model adapts to evolving political contexts. Drawing on Chain of Thought prompting, our multi-step reasoning pipeline systematically integrates demographic, ideological, and time-dependent factors, enhancing the model's predictive power.</p>

As a first step in this direction, we systematically explore the task of referential communication in a community of heterogeneous state-of-the-art pre-trained visual networks, showing that they can develop, in a self-supervised way, a shared protocol to refer to a target object among a set of candidates. This shared protocol can also be used, to some extent, to communicate about previously unseen object categories of different granularity. Moreover, a visual network that was not initially part of an existing community can learn the community's protocol with remarkable ease. Finally, we study, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the properties of the emergent protocol, providing some evidence that it is capturing high-level semantic features of objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadali Sefidi Esfahani, Mohammad Akbari</p>
<p>Abstract: Social platforms have emerged as crucial platforms for disseminating information and discussing real-life social events, offering researchers an excellent opportunity to design and implement novel event detection frameworks. However, most existing approaches only exploit keyword burstiness or network structures to detect unspecified events. Thus, they often need help identifying unknown events regarding the challenging nature of events and social data. Social data, e.g., tweets, is characterized by misspellings, incompleteness, word sense ambiguation, irregular language, and variation in aspects of opinions. Moreover, extracting discriminative features and patterns for evolving events by exploiting the limited structural knowledge is almost infeasible. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely EnrichEvent, that leverages the linguistic and contextual representations of streaming social data. In particular, we leverage contextual and linguistic knowledge to detect semantically related tweets and enhance the effectiveness of the event detection approaches. Eventually, our proposed framework produces cluster chains for each event to show the evolving variation of the event through time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our framework, validating its high performance and effectiveness in detecting and distinguishing unspecified social events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florent Forest, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) based on deep learning has proven to be an effective and flexible solution, attracting extensive research. Deep neural networks can learn rich representations from vast amounts of representative labeled data for various applications. In IFD, they achieve high classification performance from signals in an end-to-end manner, without requiring extensive domain knowledge. However, deep learning models usually only perform well on the data distribution they have been trained on. When applied to a different distribution, they may experience performance drops. This is also observed in IFD, where assets are often operated in working conditions different from those in which labeled data have been collected. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) deals with the scenario where labeled data are available in a source domain, and only unlabeled data are available in a target domain, where domains may correspond to operating conditions. Recent methods rely on training with confident pseudo-labels for target samples. However, the confidence-based selection of pseudo-labels is hindered by poorly calibrated confidence estimates in the target domain, primarily due to over-confident predictions, which limits the quality of pseudo-labels and leads to error accumulation. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher (CAT), where we propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher network throughout the self-training process, leveraging post-hoc calibration techniques. We evaluate CAT on domain-adaptive IFD and perform extensive experiments on the Paderborn benchmark for bearing fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most transfer tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Dong, Xingmin Lu, Ruohan Li, Wei Song, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah</p>
<p>Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prognostics and health management (PHM) is essential for industrial operation and maintenance, focusing on predicting, diagnosing, and managing the health status of industrial systems. The emergence of the ChatGPT-Like large-scale language model (LLM) has begun to lead a new round of innovation in the AI field. It has extensively promoted the level of intelligence in various fields. Therefore, it is also expected further to change the application paradigm in industrial PHM and promote PHM to become intelligent. Although ChatGPT-Like LLMs have rich knowledge reserves and powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, they lack domain-specific expertise, significantly limiting their practicability in PHM applications. To this end, this study explores the ChatGPT-Like LLM empowered by the local knowledge base (LKB) in industrial PHM to solve the above limitations. In addition, we introduce the method and steps of combining the LKB with LLMs, including LKB preparation, LKB vectorization, prompt engineering, etc. Experimental analysis of real cases shows that combining the LKB with ChatGPT-Like LLM can significantly improve its performance and make ChatGPT-Like LLMs more accurate, relevant, and able to provide more insightful information. This can promote the development of ChatGPT-Like LLMs in industrial PHM and promote their efficiency and quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Duan, Guibin Zhang, Shilong Wang, Xiaojiang Peng, Wang Ziqi, Junyuan Mao, Hao Wu, Xinke Jiang, Kun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to the economy. While Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fraud detection methods perform well, they often overlook the causal effect of a node's local structure on predictions. This paper introduces a novel method for credit card fraud detection, the \textbf{\underline{Ca}}usal \textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{G}}raph \textbf{\underline{N}}eural \textbf{N}etwork (CaT-GNN), which leverages causal invariant learning to reveal inherent correlations within transaction data. By decomposing the problem into discovery and intervention phases, CaT-GNN identifies causal nodes within the transaction graph and applies a causal mixup strategy to enhance the model's robustness and interpretability. CaT-GNN consists of two key components: Causal-Inspector and Causal-Intervener. The Causal-Inspector utilizes attention weights in the temporal attention mechanism to identify causal and environment nodes without introducing additional parameters. Subsequently, the Causal-Intervener performs a causal mixup enhancement on environment nodes based on the set of nodes. Evaluated on three datasets, including a private financial dataset and two public datasets, CaT-GNN demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating causal reasoning with graph neural networks to improve fraud detection capabilities in financial transactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feras Saad, Jacob Burnim, Colin Carroll, Brian Patton, Urs K\"oster, Rif A. Saurous, Matthew Hoffman</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal datasets, which consist of spatially-referenced time series, are ubiquitous in diverse applications, such as air pollution monitoring, disease tracking, and cloud-demand forecasting. As the scale of modern datasets increases, there is a growing need for statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and scalable enough to handle many observations. This article introduces the Bayesian Neural Field (BayesNF), a domain-general statistical model that infers rich spatiotemporal probability distributions for data-analysis tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and variography. BayesNF integrates a deep neural network architecture for high-capacity function estimation with hierarchical Bayesian inference for robust predictive uncertainty quantification. Evaluations against prominent baselines show that BayesNF delivers improvements on prediction problems from climate and public health data containing tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements. Accompanying the paper is an open-source software package (https://github.com/google/bayesnf) that runs on GPU and TPU accelerators through the JAX machine learning platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Auty, Roy Miles, Benedikt Kolbeinsson, Krystian Mikolajczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional knowledge distillation (KD) relies on a proficient teacher trained on the target task, which is not always available. In this setting, cross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model trained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when applied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a simple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this drop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to disregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's performance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending many KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks can be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the cross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional cost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%) when using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depth estimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack of any learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analytical insights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the distillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral regularisation component. Through this analysis we are additionally able to propose a novel regularisation loss that allows teacher-free distillation, enabling performance improvements of up to 8.57% on ImageNet with no additional training costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of algorithmic pricing raises concerns of algorithmic collusion. We conduct experiments with algorithmic pricing agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that (1) LLM-based agents are adept at pricing tasks, (2) LLM-based pricing agents autonomously collude in oligopoly settings to the detriment of consumers, and (3) variation in seemingly innocuous phrases in LLM instructions ("prompts") may increase collusion. Novel off-path analysis techniques uncover price-war concerns as contributing to these phenomena. Our results extend to auction settings. Our findings uncover unique challenges to any future regulation of LLM-based pricing agents, and black-box pricing agents more broadly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongzhi Jiang, Guanglu Song, Xiaoshi Wu, Renrui Zhang, Dazhong Shen, Zhuofan Zong, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated great success in the field of text-to-image generation. However, alleviating the misalignment between the text prompts and images is still challenging. The root reason behind the misalignment has not been extensively investigated. We observe that the misalignment is caused by inadequate token attention activation. We further attribute this phenomenon to the diffusion model's insufficient condition utilization, which is caused by its training paradigm. To address the issue, we propose CoMat, an end-to-end diffusion model fine-tuning strategy with an image-to-text concept matching mechanism. We leverage an image captioning model to measure image-to-text alignment and guide the diffusion model to revisit ignored tokens. A novel attribute concentration module is also proposed to address the attribute binding problem. Without any image or human preference data, we use only 20K text prompts to fine-tune SDXL to obtain CoMat-SDXL. Extensive experiments show that CoMat-SDXL significantly outperforms the baseline model SDXL in two text-to-image alignment benchmarks and achieves start-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaveen Hiniduma, Suren Byna, Jean Luca Bez</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications critically depend on data. Poor quality data produces inaccurate and ineffective AI models that may lead to incorrect or unsafe use. Evaluation of data readiness is a crucial step in improving the quality and appropriateness of data usage for AI. R&D efforts have been spent on improving data quality. However, standardized metrics for evaluating data readiness for use in AI training are still evolving. In this study, we perform a comprehensive survey of metrics used to verify data readiness for AI training. This survey examines more than 140 papers published by ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, journals such as Nature, Springer, and Science Direct, and online articles published by prominent AI experts. This survey aims to propose a taxonomy of data readiness for AI (DRAI) metrics for structured and unstructured datasets. We anticipate that this taxonomy will lead to new standards for DRAI metrics that will be used for enhancing the quality, accuracy, and fairness of AI training and inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshe Berchansky, Daniel Fleischer, Moshe Wasserblat, Peter Izsak</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art performance in QA tasks is currently achieved by systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs), however these models tend to hallucinate information in their responses. One approach focuses on enhancing the generation process by incorporating attribution from the given input to the output. However, the challenge of identifying appropriate attributions and verifying their accuracy against a source is a complex task that requires significant improvements in assessing such systems. We introduce an attribution-oriented Chain-of-Thought reasoning method to enhance the accuracy of attributions. This approach focuses the reasoning process on generating an attribution-centric output. Evaluations on two context-enhanced question-answering datasets using GPT-4 demonstrate improved accuracy and correctness of attributions. In addition, the combination of our method with finetuning enhances the response and attribution accuracy of two smaller LLMs, showing their potential to outperform GPT-4 in some cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhosein Toosi, Isaac Shiri, Habib Zaidi, Arman Rahmim</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an innovative, simple, effective segmentation-free approach for outcome prediction in head \& neck cancer (HNC) patients. By harnessing deep learning-based feature extraction techniques and multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) applied to Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) volumes, our proposed method eliminates the need for manual segmentations of regions-of-interest (ROIs) such as primary tumors and involved lymph nodes. Instead, a state-of-the-art object detection model is trained to perform automatic cropping of the head and neck region on the PET volumes. A pre-trained deep convolutional neural network backbone is then utilized to extract deep features from MA-MIPs obtained from 72 multi-angel axial rotations of the cropped PET volumes. These deep features extracted from multiple projection views of the PET volumes are then aggregated and fused, and employed to perform recurrence-free survival analysis on a cohort of 489 HNC patients. The proposed approach outperforms the best performing method on the target dataset for the task of recurrence-free survival analysis. By circumventing the manual delineation of the malignancies on the FDG PET-CT images, our approach eliminates the dependency on subjective interpretations and highly enhances the reproducibility of the proposed survival analysis method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge F. Urb\'an, Petros Stefanou, Jos\'e A. Pons</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05160">Selective Classification Under Distribution Shifts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyue Liang, Le Peng, Ju Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In selective classification (SC), a classifier abstains from making predictions that are likely to be wrong to avoid excessive errors. To deploy imperfect classifiers -- either due to intrinsic statistical noise of data or for robustness issue of the classifier or beyond -- in high-stakes scenarios, SC appears to be an attractive and necessary path to follow. Despite decades of research in SC, most previous SC methods still focus on the ideal statistical setting only, i.e., the data distribution at deployment is the same as that of training, although practical data can come from the wild. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an SC framework that takes into account distribution shifts, termed generalized selective classification, that covers label-shifted (or out-of-distribution) and covariate-shifted samples, in addition to typical in-distribution samples, the first of its kind in the SC literature. We focus on non-training-based confidence-score functions for generalized SC on deep learning (DL) classifiers, and propose two novel margin-based score functions. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we show that our proposed score functions are more effective and reliable than the existing ones for generalized SC on a variety of classification tasks and DL classifiers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Huang, Haoming Wang, Wei Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can be fine-tuned in custom domains to adapt to specific user preferences, but such adaptability has also been utilized for illegal purposes, such as forging public figures' portraits, duplicating copyrighted artworks and generating explicit contents. Existing work focused on detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Other schemes of model unlearning and reinitialization, similarly, cannot prevent users from relearning the knowledge of illegal model adaptation with custom data. In this paper, we present FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Our approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate the fine-tuned model's representation power in illegal adaptations, but minimize the impact on other legal adaptations. Experiment results in multiple text-to-image application domains show that FreezeAsGuard provides 37% stronger power in mitigating illegal model adaptations compared to competitive baselines, while incurring less than 5% impact on legal model adaptations.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT). However, DiT models have faced challenges with quadratic complexity efficiency, especially when handling long sequences. In this paper, we aim to incorporate the sub-quadratic modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) into the 2D diffusion backbone. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead. We offer two variants, i,e, a plain and U-shape architecture, showing superior efficiency and competitive effectiveness. In addition to superior performance to DiT and other sub-quadratic-time diffusion models at $256 \times 256$ resolution, DiG demonstrates greater efficiency than these methods starting from a $512$ resolution. Specifically, DiG-S/2 is $2.5\times$ faster and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory compared to DiT-S/2 at a $1792$ resolution. Additionally, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the Mamba-based model at a $1024$ resolution and $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with FlashAttention-2 at a $2048$ resolution. We will release the code soon. Code is released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Fujii, Masashi Hatano, Hideo Saito, Hiroki Kajita</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical phase recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential to offer solutions to numerous demands of the modern operating room. However, most existing methods concentrate on minimally invasive surgery (MIS), leaving surgical phase recognition for open surgery understudied. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the scarcity of publicly available open surgery video datasets for surgical phase recognition. To address this issue, we introduce a new egocentric open surgery video dataset for phase recognition, named EgoSurgery-Phase. This dataset comprises 15 hours of real open surgery videos spanning 9 distinct surgical phases all captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head. In addition to video, the EgoSurgery-Phase offers eye gaze. As far as we know, it is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition publicly available. Furthermore, inspired by the notable success of masked autoencoders (MAEs) in video understanding tasks (e.g., action recognition), we propose a gaze-guided masked autoencoder (GGMAE). Considering the regions where surgeons' gaze focuses are often critical for surgical phase recognition (e.g., surgical field), in our GGMAE, the gaze information acts as an empirical semantic richness prior to guiding the masking process, promoting better attention to semantically rich spatial regions. GGMAE significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art recognition method (6.4% in Jaccard) and the masked autoencoder-based method (3.1% in Jaccard) on EgoSurgery-Phase. The dataset is released at https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Li, Jing Dong, Tianxing He, Jingzhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical tool detection is a fundamental task for understanding egocentric open surgery videos. However, detecting surgical tools presents significant challenges due to their highly imbalanced class distribution, similar shapes and similar textures, and heavy occlusion. The lack of a comprehensive large-scale dataset compounds these challenges. In this paper, we introduce EgoSurgery-Tool, an extension of the existing EgoSurgery-Phase dataset, which contains real open surgery videos captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head, along with phase annotations. EgoSurgery-Tool has been densely annotated with surgical tools and comprises over 49K surgical tool bounding boxes across 15 categories, constituting a large-scale surgical tool detection dataset. EgoSurgery-Tool also provides annotations for hand detection with over 46K hand-bounding boxes, capturing hand-object interactions that are crucial for understanding activities in egocentric open surgery. EgoSurgery-Tool is superior to existing datasets due to its larger scale, greater variety of surgical tools, more annotations, and denser scenes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of EgoSurgery-Tool using nine popular object detectors to assess their effectiveness in both surgical tool and hand detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Huang, Chancharik Mitra, Assaf Arbelle, Leonid Karlinsky, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of interleaved Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in few-shot learning suggests that in-context learning (ICL) with many examples can be promising for learning new tasks. However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV) -- compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments suggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots and generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length for inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiankai Hang, Shuyang Gu, Xin Geng, Baining Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto choice for generating high-quality visual signals across various domains. However, training a single model to predict noise across various levels poses significant challenges, necessitating numerous iterations and incurring significant computational costs. Various approaches, such as loss weighting strategy design and architectural refinements, have been introduced to expedite convergence and improve model performance. In this study, we propose a novel approach to design the noise schedule for enhancing the training of diffusion models. Our key insight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise ratio ($\log \text{SNR}$), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is particularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample frequency around $\log \text{SNR}=0$. This strategic sampling allows the model to focus on the critical transition point between signal dominance and noise dominance, potentially leading to more robust and accurate predictions.We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule.Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the ImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits different prediction targets. Our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to optimize diffusion models, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective training paradigms in the field of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaodong Sun, Xiaobai Li, Jukka Komulainen, Guoying Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Fujii, Ryo Hachiuma, Hideo Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: A crowd density forecasting task aims to predict how the crowd density map will change in the future from observed past crowd density maps. However, the past crowd density maps are often incomplete due to the miss-detection of pedestrians, and it is crucial to develop a robust crowd density forecasting model against the miss-detection. This paper presents a MAsked crowd density Completion framework for crowd density forecasting (CrowdMAC), which is simultaneously trained to forecast future crowd density maps from partially masked past crowd density maps (i.e., forecasting maps from past maps with miss-detection) while reconstructing the masked observation maps (i.e., imputing past maps with miss-detection). Additionally, we propose Temporal-Density-aware Masking (TDM), which non-uniformly masks tokens in the observed crowd density map, considering the sparsity of the crowd density maps and the informativeness of the subsequent frames for the forecasting task. Moreover, we introduce multi-task masking to enhance training efficiency. In the experiments, CrowdMAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven large-scale datasets, including SDD, ETH-UCY, inD, JRDB, VSCrowd, FDST, and croHD. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method against both synthetic and realistic miss-detections. The code is released at https://fujiry0.github.io/CrowdMAC-project-page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wang, Antonis Antoniades, Yanai Elazar, Alfonso Amayuelas, Alon Albalak, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth. We also show the practical implications of our analysis through a novel prompt optimization algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Lahlali, Nicolas Granger, Herv\'e Le Borgne, Quoc-Cuong Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics and augmented reality. However, training 3D detectors requires a costly precise annotation, which is a hindrance to scaling annotation to large datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a weakly supervised 3D annotator that relies solely on 2D bounding box annotations from images, along with size priors. One major problem is that supervising a 3D detection model using only 2D boxes is not reliable due to ambiguities between different 3D poses and their identical 2D projection. We introduce a simple yet effective and generic solution: we build 3D proxy objects with annotations by construction and add them to the training dataset. Our method requires only size priors to adapt to new classes. To better align 2D supervision with 3D detection, our method ensures depth invariance with a novel expression of the 2D losses. Finally, to detect more challenging instances, our annotator follows an offline pseudo-labelling scheme which gradually improves its 3D pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method not only performs on-par or above previous works on the Car category, but also achieves performance close to fully supervised methods on more challenging classes. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by being the first to experiment on the more challenging nuScenes dataset. We additionally propose a setting where weak labels are obtained from a 2D detector pre-trained on MS-COCO instead of human annotations. The code is available at https://github.com/CEA-LIST/ALPI</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhosein Toosi, Sara Harsini, Fran\c{c}ois B\'enard, Carlos Uribe, Arman Rahmim</p>
<p>Abstract: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging provides a tremendously exciting frontier in visualization of prostate cancer (PCa) metastatic lesions. However, accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios and variable sizes, shapes, and locations of the lesions. This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of metastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D volumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains the final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic PCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for quantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyue Wan, Yuanfeng Song, Shuaimin Li, Chen Jason Zhang, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Data visualization (DV) is the fundamental and premise tool to improve the efficiency in conveying the insights behind the big data, which has been widely accepted in existing data-driven world. Task automation in DV, such as converting natural language queries to visualizations (i.e., text-to-vis), generating explanations from visualizations (i.e., vis-to-text), answering DV-related questions in free form (i.e. FeVisQA), and explicating tabular data (i.e., table-to-text), is vital for advancing the field. Despite their potential, the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like T5 and BERT in DV has been limited by high costs and challenges in handling cross-modal information, leading to few studies on PLMs for DV. We introduce DataVisT5, a novel PLM tailored for DV that enhances the T5 architecture through a hybrid objective pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning strategy, integrating text and DV datasets to effectively interpret cross-modal semantics. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that DataVisT5 consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models on various DV-related tasks. We anticipate that DataVisT5 will not only inspire further research on vertical PLMs but also expand the range of applications for PLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huifa Li, Jie Fu, Xinpeng Ling, Zhiyu Sun, Kuncan Wang, Zhili Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The swift advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the investigation of cellular-level tissue heterogeneity. Cell annotation significantly contributes to the extensive downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, The analysis of scRNA-seq for biological inference presents challenges owing to its intricate and indeterminate data distribution, characterized by a substantial volume and a high frequency of dropout events. Furthermore, the quality of training samples varies greatly, and the performance of the popular scRNA-seq data clustering solution GNN could be harmed by two types of low-quality training nodes: 1) nodes on the boundary; 2) nodes that contribute little additional information to the graph. To address these problems, we propose a single-cell curriculum learning-based deep graph embedding clustering (scCLG). We first propose a Chebyshev graph convolutional autoencoder with multi-criteria (ChebAE) that combines three optimization objectives, including topology reconstruction loss of cell graphs, zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss, and clustering loss, to learn cell-cell topology representation. Meanwhile, we employ a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the features and entropy of nodes and prune the difficult nodes based on the difficulty scores to keep the high-quality graph. Empirical results on a variety of gene expression datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code of scCLG will be made publicly available at https://github.com/LFD-byte/scCLG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wall Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence modeling with State Space models (SSMs) has demonstrated performance surpassing that of Transformers in various tasks, raising expectations for their potential to outperform the Decision Transformer and its enhanced variants in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, decision models based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art SSM, failed to achieve superior performance compared to these enhanced Decision Transformers. We hypothesize that this limitation arises from information loss during the selective scanning phase. To address this, we propose the Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which augments Mamba with a token mixer in its input layer. This mixer explicitly accounts for the multimodal nature of offline RL inputs, comprising state, action, and return-to-go. The DMM demonstrates improved performance while significantly reducing parameter count compared to prior models. Notably, similar performance gains were achieved using a simple linear token mixer, emphasizing the importance of preserving information from proximate time steps rather than the specific design of the token mixer itself. This novel modification to Mamba's input layer represents a departure from conventional timestamp-based encoding approaches used in Transformers. By enhancing performance of Mamba in offline RL, characterized by memory efficiency and fast inference, this work opens new avenues for its broader application in future RL research.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI assistants are being increasingly used by students enrolled in higher education institutions. While these tools provide opportunities for improved teaching and education, they also pose significant challenges for assessment and learning outcomes. We conceptualize these challenges through the lens of vulnerability, the potential for university assessments and learning outcomes to be impacted by student use of generative AI. We investigate the potential scale of this vulnerability by measuring the degree to which AI assistants can complete assessment questions in standard university-level STEM courses. Specifically, we compile a novel dataset of textual assessment questions from 50 courses at EPFL and evaluate whether two AI assistants, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adequately answer these questions. We use eight prompting strategies to produce responses and find that GPT-4 answers an average of 65.8% of questions correctly, and can even produce the correct answer across at least one prompting strategy for 85.1% of questions. When grouping courses in our dataset by degree program, these systems already pass non-project assessments of large numbers of core courses in various degree programs, posing risks to higher education accreditation that will be amplified as these models improve. Our results call for revising program-level assessment design in higher education in light of advances in generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanbing Zhu, Bingke Zhu, Yingying Chen, Yunfang Niu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), \eg CLIP, are increasingly used to bridge the gap between open- and close-vocabulary recognition in open-vocabulary image segmentation. As VLMs are generally pretrained with low-resolution images (e.g. $224\times224$), most previous methods operate only on downscaled images. We question this design as low resolution features often fail to preserve fine details. A typical solution is to employ additional image backbones for high-resolution inputs, but it also introduce significant computation overhead. Therefore, we propose MROVSeg, a multi-resolution training framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation with a single pretrained CLIP backbone, that uses sliding windows to slice the high-resolution input into uniform patches, each matching the input size of the well-trained image encoder. Its key components include a Multi-Res Adapter, which restores the spatial geometry and grasps local-global correspondences across patches by interacting with multi-resolution features. To achieve accurate segmentation, we introduce Multi-grained Masked Attention scheme to aggregate multi-grained semantics from multi-resolution CLIP features to object queries. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of MROVSeg on well-established open-vocabulary image segmentation benchmarks, establishing new standards for open-vocabulary image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) measures the likelihood of a feature set being both necessary and sufficient for predicting an outcome. It has proven effective in guiding representation learning for unimodal data, enhancing both predictive performance and model robustness. Despite these benefits, extending PNS to multimodal settings remains unexplored. This extension presents unique challenges, as the conditions for PNS estimation, exogeneity and monotonicity, need to be reconsidered in a multimodal context. We address these challenges by first conceptualizing multimodal representations as comprising modality-invariant and modality-specific components. We then analyze how to compute PNS for each component while ensuring non-trivial PNS estimation. Based on these analyses, we formulate tractable optimization objectives that enable multimodal models to learn high-PNS representations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Ye, Peiwen Sun, Jiahe Lei, Hongzhan Lin, Xu Tan, Zheqi Dai, Qiuqiang Kong, Jianyi Chen, Jiahao Pan, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Wei Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation.

<p>Abstract: Much previous AI research has focused on developing monolithic models to maximize their intelligence, with the primary goal of enhancing performance on specific tasks. In contrast, this work attempts to study using LLM-based agents to design collaborative AI systems autonomously. To explore this problem, we first introduce ComfyBench to evaluate agents's ability to design collaborative AI systems in ComfyUI. ComfyBench is a comprehensive benchmark comprising 200 diverse tasks covering various instruction-following generation challenges, along with detailed annotations for 3,205 nodes and 20 workflows. Based on ComfyBench, we further develop ComfyAgent, a novel framework that empowers LLM-based agents to autonomously design collaborative AI systems by generating workflows. ComfyAgent is based on two core concepts. First, it represents workflows with code, which can be reversibly converted into workflows and executed as collaborative systems by the interpreter. Second, it constructs a multi-agent system that cooperates to learn from existing workflows and generate new workflows for a given task. While experimental results demonstrate that ComfyAgent achieves a comparable resolve rate to o1-preview and significantly surpasses other agents on ComfyBench, ComfyAgent has resolved only 15\% of creative tasks. LLM-based agents still have a long way to go in autonomously designing collaborative AI systems. Progress with ComfyBench is paving the way for more intelligent and autonomous collaborative AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Zhang, Xin Zou, Jinshan Yang, Wenjun Chen, Juan Liu, Faya Liang, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analyzing System (MLVAS), a novel system that leverages both audio and video data to automatically extract key segments and metrics from raw laryngeal videostroboscopic videos for assisted clinical assessment. The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Additionally, MLVAS features an advanced strobing video extraction module that specifically identifies strobing frames from laryngeal videostroboscopy by analyzing hue, saturation, and value fluctuations. Beyond key segment extraction, MLVAS provides effective metrics for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. It employs a novel two-stage glottis segmentation process using a U-Net for initial segmentation, followed by a diffusion-based refinement to reduce false positives, providing better segmentation masks for downstream tasks. MLVAS estimates the vibration dynamics for both left and right vocal folds from the segmented glottis masks to detect unilateral VFP by measuring the angle deviation with the estimated glottal midline. Comparing the variance between left's and right's dynamics, the system effectively distinguishes between left and right VFP. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI search engines, e.g., SearchGPT, showcasing a new paradigm in human-internet interaction. However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine. We hope MMSearch may provide unique insights to guide the future development of multimodal AI search engine. Project Page: https://mmsearch.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly recognized as an effective approach for mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs) through the integration of external knowledge. While numerous efforts, most studies focus on a single type of externeal knowledge source. However, in real-world applications, most situations involve diverse knowledge from various sources, yet this area has been less explored. The main dilemma is the lack of a suitable dataset containing multiple knowledge sources and pre-exploration of the associated issues. To address these challenges, we standardize a benchmark dataset that combines structured and unstructured knowledge across diverse and complementary domains. Based on this dataset, we further develop a plug-and-play RAG framework, PruningRAG, whose main characteristic is to employ multi-granularity pruning strategies for optimizing the integration of relevant information and minimizing misleading context. Building upon the standardized dataset and PruningRAG, we also report a series of experimental results, as well as insightful findings. Our dataset and code are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/USTCAGI/PruningRAG}, with the aim of advancing future research in the RAG community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Zhang, Andrew Thwaites, Alexandra Woolgar, Brian Moore, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network (CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rayhan Zirvi, Bahareh Tolooshams, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Wang, Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Renmiao Chen, Hao Wang, Chengwei Pan, Lei Sha, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yein Park, Chanwoong Yoon, Jungwoo Park, Donghyeon Lee, Minbyul Jeong, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant changes to many aspects of our lives. However, assessing and ensuring their chronological knowledge remains challenging. Existing approaches fall short in addressing the temporal adaptability of knowledge, often relying on a fixed time-point view. To overcome this, we introduce ChroKnowBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate chronologically accumulated knowledge across three key aspects: multiple domains, time dependency, temporal state. Our benchmark distinguishes between knowledge that evolves (e.g., personal history, scientific discoveries, amended laws) and knowledge that remain constant (e.g., mathematical truths, commonsense facts). Building on this benchmark, we present ChroKnowledge (Chronological Categorization of Knowledge), a novel sampling-based framework for evaluating LLMs' non-parametric chronological knowledge. Our evaluation led to the following observations: (1) The ability of eliciting temporal knowledge varies depending on the data format that model was trained on. (2) LLMs partially recall knowledge or show a cut-off at temporal boundaries rather than recalling all aspects of knowledge correctly. Thus, we apply ourChroKnowPrompt, an in-depth prompting to elicit chronological knowledge by traversing step-by-step through the surrounding time spans. We observe that it successfully recalls objects across both open-source and proprietary LLMs, demonstrating versatility, though it faces challenges with dynamic datasets and unstructured formats.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> So Kuroki, Taishi Nakamura, Takuya Akiba, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models to acquire specific skills remains a challenging endeavor. Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxuan Gao, Shusheng Xu, Wenjie Ye, Weilin Liu, Chuyi He, Wei Fu, Zhiyu Mei, Guangju Wang, Yi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models have been increasingly critical for improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing research has shown that a well-trained reward model can substantially improve model performances at inference time via search. However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still remains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward models can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which verify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward models for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and the Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for math problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards. Surprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong inference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training, producing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only. Our analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these reward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to a severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward refinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure the accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a learned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our techniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward function, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all the evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqi Yang, Hongye Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this report, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak attacking framework that incorporates various LLM-as-Attacker methods to deliver transferable and powerful jailbreak attacks. Our method is designed based on three key observations from existing jailbreaking studies and practices. First, we consider an ensemble approach should be more effective in exposing the vulnerabilities of an aligned LLM compared to individual attacks. Second, different malicious instructions inherently vary in their jailbreaking difficulty, necessitating differentiated treatment to ensure more efficient attacks. Finally, the semantic coherence of a malicious instruction is crucial for triggering the defenses of an aligned LLM; therefore, it must be carefully disrupted to manipulate its embedding representation, thereby increasing the jailbreak success rate. We validated our approach by participating in the Competition for LLM and Agent Safety 2024, where our team achieved top performance in the Jailbreaking Attack Track.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joey Hong, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Value-based reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle learn effective policies for a wide range of multi-turn problems, from games to dialogue to robotic control, including via offline RL from static previously collected datasets. However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to train large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering), value-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have proven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language models. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to large architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large datasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL methods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses these drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) problem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In this way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the likelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function during finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying performance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in practice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this, our approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models, without the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without the need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages. Empirically, we evaluate our method on both pretrained LLMs and VLMs, on a variety of tasks including both natural language dialogue and robotic manipulation and navigation from images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghua Zhang, Haiyang Yu, Cheng Fu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyeok Lee, Keisuke Sakaguchi, JinYeong Bak</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-training approach for large language models (LLMs) improves reasoning abilities by training the models on their self-generated rationales. Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmut S. Gokmen, Caner Ozcan, Moneera N. Haque, Cody Bumgardner</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitates effective risk assessment strategies, with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring via computed tomography (CT) being a key method for prevention. Traditional methods, primarily based on UNET architectures implemented on pre-built models, face challenges like the scarcity of annotated CT scans containing CAC and imbalanced datasets, leading to reduced performance in segmentation and scoring tasks. In this study, we address these limitations by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels), which trains without requiring CAC-specific annotations, enhancing its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO-LG model, which leverages label guidance to focus on calcified areas, achieves significant improvements, with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 90% for detecting CAC-containing CT slices, compared to the standard DINO model's sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 77%. Additionally, false-negative and false-positive rates are reduced by 49% and 59%, respectively, instilling greater confidence in clinicians when ruling out calcification in low-risk patients and minimizing unnecessary imaging reviews by radiologists. Further, CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are conducted using a basic UNET architecture, applied specifically to CT slices identified by the DINO-LG model as containing calcified areas. This targeted approach enhances CAC scoring accuracy by feeding the UNET model with relevant slices, significantly improving diagnostic precision, reducing both false positives and false negatives, and ultimately lowering overall healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary tests and treatments, presenting a valuable advancement in CAD risk assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</p>

<p>Abstract: The year 2022 marks a watershed in technology, and arguably in human history, with the release of powerful generative AIs capable of convincingly performing creative tasks. With the help of these systems, anyone can create something that would previously have been considered a remarkable work of art. In human-AI collaboration, the computer seems to have become more than a tool. Many who have made their first contact with current generative AIs see them as "creativity machines" while for others the term "machine creativity" remains an oxymoron. This article is about (the possibility of) creativity in computers within the current Machine Learning paradigm. It outlines some of the key concepts behind the technologies and the innovations that have contributed to this qualitative shift, with a focus on text-to-image systems. The nature of Artificial Creativity as such is discussed, as well as what this might mean for art.

An effective jailbreak approach is to identify a domain where safety generalization fails, a phenomenon known as mismatched generalization. In this paper, we introduce two novel jailbreak methods based on mismatched generalization: natural language games and custom language games, both of which effectively bypass the safety mechanisms of LLMs, with various kinds and different variants, making them hard to defend and leading to high attack rates. Natural language games involve the use of synthetic linguistic constructs and the actions intertwined with these constructs, such as the Ubbi Dubbi language. Building on this phenomenon, we propose the custom language games method: by engaging with LLMs using a variety of custom rules, we successfully execute jailbreak attacks across multiple LLM platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, achieving success rates of 93% on GPT-4o, 89% on GPT-4o-mini and 83% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Furthermore, to investigate the generalizability of safety alignments, we fine-tuned Llama-3.1-70B with the custom language games to achieve safety alignment within our datasets and found that when interacting through other language games, the fine-tuned models still failed to identify harmful content. This finding indicates that the safety alignment knowledge embedded in LLMs fails to generalize across different linguistic formats, thus opening new avenues for future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyun Ryu, Eric Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient inference in large language models (LLMs) has become a critical focus as their scale and complexity grow. Traditional autoregressive decoding, while effective, suffers from computational inefficiencies due to its sequential token generation process. Speculative decoding addresses this bottleneck by introducing a two-stage framework: drafting and verification. A smaller, efficient model generates a preliminary draft, which is then refined by a larger, more sophisticated model. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of speculative decoding methods, categorizing them into draft-centric and model-centric approaches. We discuss key ideas associated with each method, highlighting their potential for scaling LLM inference. This survey aims to guide future research in optimizing speculative decoding and its integration into real-world LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Wang, Jia Li, Heng Chang, Keli Zhang, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we discover that causal inference provides a promising approach to capture heterophilic message-passing in Graph Neural Network (GNN). By leveraging cause-effect analysis, we can discern heterophilic edges based on asymmetric node dependency. The learned causal structure offers more accurate relationships among nodes. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce intervention-based causal inference in graph learning. We first simplify causal analysis on graphs by formulating it as a structural learning model and define the optimization problem within the Bayesian scheme. We then present an analysis of decomposing the optimization target into a consistency penalty and a structure modification based on cause-effect relations. We then estimate this target by conditional entropy and present insights into how conditional entropy quantifies the heterophily. Accordingly, we propose CausalMP, a causal message-passing discovery network for heterophilic graph learning, that iteratively learns the explicit causal structure of input graphs. We conduct extensive experiments in both heterophilic and homophilic graph settings. The result demonstrates that the our model achieves superior link prediction performance. Training on causal structure can also enhance node representation in classification task across different base models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Declan Curran, Hira Saleem, Sanaa Hobeichi, Flora Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding future weather changes at regional and local scales is crucial for planning and decision-making, particularly in the context of extreme weather events, as well as for broader applications in agriculture, insurance, and infrastructure development. However, the computational cost of downscaling Global Climate Models (GCMs) to the fine resolutions needed for such applications presents a significant barrier. Drawing on advancements in weather forecasting models, this study introduces a cost-efficient downscaling method using a pretrained Earth Vision Transformer (Earth ViT) model. Initially trained on ERA5 data to downscale from 50 km to 25 km resolution, the model is then tested on the higher resolution BARRA-SY dataset at a 3 km resolution. Remarkably, it performs well without additional training, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different resolutions. This approach holds promise for generating large ensembles of regional climate simulations by downscaling GCMs with varying input resolutions without incurring additional training costs. Ultimately, this method could provide more comprehensive estimates of potential future changes in key climate variables, aiding in effective planning for extreme weather events and climate change adaptation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Dong, Charlie F. Ruan, Yaxing Cai, Ruihang Lai, Ziyi Xu, Yilong Zhao, Tianqi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumil Datta, Shih-Chieh Dai, Leo Yu, Guanhong Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have shown exceptional potential in generating high-quality images. However, recent studies highlight concerns over the use of unauthorized data in training these models, which may lead to intellectual property infringement or privacy violations. A promising approach to mitigate these issues is to apply a watermark to images and subsequently check if generative models reproduce similar watermark features. In this paper, we examine the robustness of various watermark-based protection methods applied to text-to-image models. We observe that common image transformations are ineffective at removing the watermark effect. Therefore, we propose RATTAN, that leverages the diffusion process to conduct controlled image generation on the protected input, preserving the high-level features of the input while ignoring the low-level details utilized by watermarks. A small number of generated images are then used to fine-tune protected models. Our experiments on three datasets and 140 text-to-image diffusion models reveal that existing state-of-the-art protections are not robust against RATTAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> N. Pirnay, S. Jerbi, J. -P. Seifert, J. Eisert</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the core challenges of research in quantum computing is concerned with the question whether quantum advantages can be found for near-term quantum circuits that have implications for practical applications. Motivated by this mindset, in this work, we prove an unconditional quantum advantage in the probably approximately correct (PAC) distribution learning framework with shallow quantum circuit hypotheses. We identify a meaningful generative distribution learning problem where constant-depth quantum circuits using one and two qubit gates (QNC^0) are superior compared to constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits (NC^0) as a choice for hypothesis classes. We hence prove a PAC distribution learning separation for shallow quantum circuits over shallow classical circuits. We do so by building on recent results by Bene Watts and Parham on unconditional quantum advantages for sampling tasks with shallow circuits, which we technically uplift to a hyperplane learning problem, identifying non-local correlations as the origin of the quantum advantage.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16872">Enabling Adoption of Regenerative Agriculture through Soil Carbon Copilots</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Margaret Capetz, Swati Sharma, Rafael Padilha, Peder Olsen, Jessica Wolk, Emre Kiciman, Ranveer Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating climate change requires transforming agriculture to minimize environ mental impact and build climate resilience. Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyuan Tu, Zhen Xing, Xintong Han, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Qi Dai, Chong Luo, Zuxuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents StableAnimator, the first end-to-end ID-preserving video diffusion framework, which synthesizes high-quality videos without any post-processing, conditioned on a reference image and a sequence of poses. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator begins by computing image and face embeddings with off-the-shelf extractors, respectively and face embeddings are further refined by interacting with image embeddings using a global content-aware Face Encoder. Then, StableAnimator introduces a novel distribution-aware ID Adapter that prevents interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via alignment. During inference, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation-based optimization to further enhance the face quality. We demonstrate that solving the HJB equation can be integrated into the diffusion denoising process, and the resulting solution constrains the denoising path and thus benefits ID preservation. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAnimator both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>
