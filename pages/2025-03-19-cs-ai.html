<p><b>Authors:</b> Gon\c{c}alo Hora de Carvalho</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13499">Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and LLMs for Context-Aware Messaging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajeev Kumar, Harishankar Kumar, Kumari Shalini</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized messaging plays an essential role in improving communication in areas such as healthcare, education, and professional engagement. This paper introduces a framework that uses the Knowledge Graph (KG) to dynamically rephrase written communications by integrating individual and context-specific data. The knowledge graph represents individuals, locations, and events as critical nodes, linking entities mentioned in messages to their corresponding graph nodes. The extraction of relevant information, such as preferences, professional roles, and cultural norms, is then combined with the original message and processed through a large language model (LLM) to generate personalized responses. The framework demonstrates notable message acceptance rates in various domains: 42% in healthcare, 53% in education, and 78% in professional recruitment. By integrating entity linking, event detection, and language modeling, this approach offers a structured and scalable solution for context-aware, audience-specific communication, facilitating advanced applications in diverse fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Mai, David Kacz\'er, Nicholas Kluge Corr\^ea, Lucie Flek</p>
<p>Abstract: Two core challenges of alignment are 1) scalable oversight and 2) accounting for the dynamic nature of human values. While solutions like recursive reward modeling address 1), they do not simultaneously account for 2). We sketch a roadmap for a novel algorithmic framework that trains a superhuman reasoning model to decompose complex tasks into subtasks that are still amenable to human-level guidance. Our approach relies on what we call the part-to-complete generalization hypothesis, which states that the alignment of subtask solutions generalizes to the alignment of complete solutions. We advocate for the need to measure this generalization and propose ways to improve it in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mert Cemri, Melissa Z. Pan, Shuyi Yang, Lakshya A. Agrawal, Bhavya Chopra, Rishabh Tiwari, Kurt Keutzer, Aditya Parameswaran, Dan Klein, Kannan Ramchandran, Matei Zaharia, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite growing enthusiasm for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to accomplish tasks, their performance gains across popular benchmarks remain minimal compared to single-agent frameworks. This gap highlights the need to analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness.
  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of MAS challenges. We analyze five popular MAS frameworks across over 150 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. We identify 14 unique failure modes and propose a comprehensive taxonomy applicable to various MAS frameworks. This taxonomy emerges iteratively from agreements among three expert annotators per study, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.88. These fine-grained failure modes are organized into 3 categories, (i) specification and system design failures, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification and termination. To support scalable evaluation, we integrate MASFT with LLM-as-a-Judge. We also explore if identified failures could be easily prevented by proposing two interventions: improved specification of agent roles and enhanced orchestration strategies. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We open-source our dataset and LLM annotator.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13708">A Circular Construction Product Ontology for End-of-Life Decision-Making</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwabena Adu-Duodu, Stanly Wilson, Yinhao Li, Aanuoluwapo Oladimeji, Talea Huraysi, Masoud Barati, Charith Perera, Ellis Solaiman, Omer Rana, Rajiv Ranjan, Tejal Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient management of end-of-life (EoL) products is critical for advancing circularity in supply chains, particularly within the construction industry where EoL strategies are hindered by heterogenous lifecycle data and data silos. Current tools like Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and Digital Product Passports (DPPs) are limited by their dependency on seamless data integration and interoperability which remain significant challenges. To address these, we present the Circular Construction Product Ontology (CCPO), an applied framework designed to overcome semantic and data heterogeneity challenges in EoL decision-making for construction products. CCPO standardises vocabulary and facilitates data integration across supply chain stakeholders enabling lifecycle assessments (LCA) and robust decision-making. By aggregating disparate data into a unified product provenance, CCPO enables automated EoL recommendations through customisable SWRL rules aligned with European standards and stakeholder-specific circularity SLAs, demonstrating its scalability and integration capabilities. The adopted circular product scenario depicts CCPO's application while competency question evaluations show its superior performance in generating accurate EoL suggestions highlighting its potential to greatly improve decision-making in circular supply chains and its applicability in real-world construction environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Guo, Harry Shomer, Shenglai Zeng, Haoyu Han, Yu Wang, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. However, they often suffer from knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) enhances LLM reasoning by integrating structured knowledge from external graphs. However, we identify two key challenges that plague GraphRAG:(1) Retrieving noisy and irrelevant information can degrade performance and (2)Excessive reliance on external knowledge suppresses the model's intrinsic reasoning. To address these issues, we propose GraphRAG-FI (Filtering and Integration), consisting of GraphRAG-Filtering and GraphRAG-Integration. GraphRAG-Filtering employs a two-stage filtering mechanism to refine retrieved information. GraphRAG-Integration employs a logits-based selection strategy to balance external knowledge from GraphRAG with the LLM's intrinsic reasoning,reducing over-reliance on retrievals. Experiments on knowledge graph QA tasks demonstrate that GraphRAG-FI significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple backbone models, establishing a more reliable and effective GraphRAG framework.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13813">Automatic MILP Model Construction for Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Scheduling Based on Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingming Peng, Zhendong Chen, Jie Yang, Jin Huang, Zhengqi Shi, Qihao Liu, Xinyu Li, Liang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the accelerated development of Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing systems increasingly require efficient task allocation and scheduling in multi-robot systems. However, existing methods rely on domain expertise and face challenges in adapting to dynamic production constraints. Additionally, enterprises have high privacy requirements for production scheduling data, which prevents the use of cloud-based large language models (LLMs) for solution development. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for an automated modeling solution that meets data privacy requirements. This study proposes a knowledge-augmented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) automated formulation framework, integrating local LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases to generate executable code from natural language descriptions automatically. The framework employs a knowledge-guided DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model to extract complex spatiotemporal constraints (82% average accuracy) and leverages a supervised fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model for efficient MILP code generation (90% average accuracy). Experimental results demonstrate that the framework successfully achieves automatic modeling in the aircraft skin manufacturing case while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. This research provides a low-barrier and highly reliable technical path for modeling in complex industrial scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13817">VARP: Reinforcement Learning from Vision-Language Model Feedback with Agent Regularized Preferences</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anukriti Singh, Amisha Bhaskar, Peihong Yu, Souradip Chakraborty, Ruthwik Dasyam, Amrit Bedi, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing reward functions for continuous-control robotics often leads to subtle misalignments or reward hacking, especially in complex tasks. Preference-based RL mitigates some of these pitfalls by learning rewards from comparative feedback rather than hand-crafted signals, yet scaling human annotations remains challenging. Recent work uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate preference labeling, but a single final-state image generally fails to capture the agent's full motion. In this paper, we present a two-part solution that both improves feedback accuracy and better aligns reward learning with the agent's policy. First, we overlay trajectory sketches on final observations to reveal the path taken, allowing VLMs to provide more reliable preferences-improving preference accuracy by approximately 15-20% in metaworld tasks. Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's performance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data generated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30% in locomotion tasks. Empirical studies on metaworld demonstrate that our method achieves, for instance, around 70-80% success rate in all tasks, compared to below 50% for standard approaches. These results underscore the efficacy of combining richer visual representations with agent-aware reward regularization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13843">WebNav: An Intelligent Agent for Voice-Controlled Web Navigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Trisanth Srinivasan, Santosh Patapati</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing reliance on web interfaces presents many challenges for visually impaired users, showcasing the need for more advanced assistive technologies. This paper introduces WebNav, a voice-controlled web navigation agent that leverages a ReAct-inspired architecture and generative AI to provide this framework. WebNav comprises of a hierarchical structure: a Digital Navigation Module (DIGNAV) for high-level strategic planning, an Assistant Module for translating abstract commands into executable actions, and an Inference Module for low-level interaction. A key component is a dynamic labeling engine, implemented as a browser extension, that generates real-time labels for interactive elements, creating mapping between voice commands and Document Object Model (DOM) components. Preliminary evaluations show that WebNav outperforms traditional screen readers in response time and task completion accuracy for the visually impaired. Future work will focus on extensive user evaluations, benchmark development, and refining the agent's adaptive capabilities for real-world deployment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13856">MDTeamGPT: A Self-Evolving LLM-based Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Disciplinary Team Medical Consultation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Chen, Xinfeng Li, Tianpei Yang, Hewei Wang, Wei Dong, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various fields. However, challenges remain in Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) medical consultations. Current research enhances reasoning through role assignment, task decomposition, and accumulation of medical experience. Multi-role collaboration in MDT consultations often results in excessively long dialogue histories. This increases the model's cognitive burden and degrades both efficiency and accuracy. Some methods only store treatment histories. They do not extract effective experience or reflect on errors. This limits knowledge generalization and system evolution. We propose a multi-agent MDT medical consultation framework based on LLMs to address these issues. Our framework uses consensus aggregation and a residual discussion structure for multi-round consultations. It also employs a Correct Answer Knowledge Base (CorrectKB) and a Chain-of-Thought Knowledge Base (ChainKB) to accumulate consultation experience. These mechanisms enable the framework to evolve and continually improve diagnosis rationality and accuracy. Experimental results on the MedQA and PubMedQA datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves accuracies of 90.1% and 83.9%, respectively, and that the constructed knowledge bases generalize effectively across test sets from both datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13879">Bridging Social Psychology and LLM Reasoning: Conflict-Aware Meta-Review Generation via Cognitive Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Han Ding, Meng Yuan, Zhao Zhang, Deqing Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of scholarly submissions has overwhelmed traditional peer review systems, driving the need for intelligent automation to preserve scientific rigor. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating manuscript critiques, their ability to synthesize high-stakes meta-reviews, which require conflict-aware reasoning and consensus derivation, remains underdeveloped. Existing methods fail to effectively handle conflicting viewpoints within differing opinions, and often introduce additional cognitive biases, such as anchoring effects and conformity bias.To overcome these limitations, we propose the Cognitive Alignment Framework (CAF), a dual-process architecture that transforms LLMs into adaptive scientific arbitrators. By operationalizing Kahneman's dual-process theory, CAF introduces a three-step cognitive pipeline: review initialization, incremental integration, and cognitive alignment.Empirical validation shows that CAF outperforms existing LLM-based methods, with sentiment consistency gains reaching up to 19.47\% and content consistency improving by as much as 12.95\%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14130">Inference-Time Intervention in Large Language Models for Reliable Requirement Verification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Darm, James Xie, Annalisa Riccardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenge, particularly in engineering applications where precision and reliability are critical. While fine-tuning and prompting methods can modify model behavior, they lack the dynamic and exact control necessary for engineering applications. Inference-time intervention techniques provide a promising alternative, allowing targeted adjustments to LLM outputs. In this work, we demonstrate how interventions enable fine-grained control for automating the usually time-intensive requirement verification process in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Using two early-stage Capella SysML models of space missions with associated requirements, we apply the intervened LLMs to reason over a graph representation of the model to determine whether a requirement is fulfilled. Our method achieves robust and reliable outputs, significantly improving over both a baseline model and a fine-tuning approach. By identifying and modifying as few as one to three specialised attention heads, we can significantly change the model's behavior. When combined with self-consistency, this allows us to achieve perfect precision on our holdout test set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyun Zhang, Jiacheng Ruan, Xian Gao, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical to ensure product quality during manufacturing. Although existing zero-shot defect segmentation and detection methods have shown effectiveness, they cannot provide detailed descriptions of the defects. Furthermore, the application of large multi-modal models in IAD remains in its infancy, facing challenges in balancing question-answering (QA) performance and mask-based grounding capabilities, often owing to overfitting during the fine-tuning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that introduces a dedicated multi-modal defect localization module to decouple the dialog functionality from the core feature extraction. This decoupling is achieved through independent optimization objectives and tailored learning strategies. Additionally, we contribute to the first multi-modal industrial anomaly detection training dataset, named Defect Detection Question Answering (DDQA), encompassing a wide range of defect types and industrial scenarios. Unlike conventional datasets that rely on GPT-generated data, DDQA ensures authenticity and reliability and offers a robust foundation for model training. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Assistant (EIAD), achieves outstanding performance in defect detection and localization tasks. It not only significantly enhances accuracy but also improves interpretability. These advancements highlight the potential of EIAD for practical applications in industrial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingtian Tan, Mike A. Merrill, Zack Gottesman, Tim Althoff, David Evans, Tom Hartvigsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data measure how environments change over time and drive decision-making in critical domains like finance and healthcare. When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Dong, Fengyi Wu, Qi He, Heng Li, Minghan Li, Zebang Cheng, Yuxuan Zhou, Jingdong Sun, Qi Dai, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Alexander G Hauptmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) systems often focus on either discrete (panoramic) or continuous (free-motion) paradigms alone, overlooking the complexities of human-populated, dynamic environments. We introduce a unified Human-Aware VLN (HA-VLN) benchmark that merges these paradigms under explicit social-awareness constraints. Our contributions include: 1. A standardized task definition that balances discrete-continuous navigation with personal-space requirements; 2. An enhanced human motion dataset (HAPS 2.0) and upgraded simulators capturing realistic multi-human interactions, outdoor contexts, and refined motion-language alignment; 3. Extensive benchmarking on 16,844 human-centric instructions, revealing how multi-human dynamics and partial observability pose substantial challenges for leading VLN agents; 4. Real-world robot tests validating sim-to-real transfer in crowded indoor spaces; and 5. A public leaderboard supporting transparent comparisons across discrete and continuous tasks. Empirical results show improved navigation success and fewer collisions when social context is integrated, underscoring the need for human-centric design. By releasing all datasets, simulators, agent code, and evaluation tools, we aim to advance safer, more capable, and socially responsible VLN research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14234">KG-IRAG: A Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Temporal Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyi Yang, Hao Xue, Imran Razzak, Hakim Hacid, Flora D. Salim</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Wang, Meng Long, Qiang Wu, Wei Liu, Jiatian Pi, Xinmin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) can effectively reduce vehicle travel times by dynamically adjusting signal timings but poses a critical challenge in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of real-time decision-making in dynamic and uncertain traffic conditions. The burgeoning field of intelligent transportation systems, bolstered by artificial intelligence techniques and extensive data availability, offers new prospects for the implementation of ATSC. In this study, we introduce a parallel hybrid action space reinforcement learning model (PH-DDPG) that optimizes traffic signal phase and duration of traffic signals simultaneously, eliminating the need for sequential decision-making seen in traditional two-stage models. Our model features a task-specific parallel hybrid action space tailored for adaptive traffic control, which directly outputs discrete phase selections and their associated continuous duration parameters concurrently, thereby inherently addressing dynamic traffic adaptation through unified parametric optimization. %Our model features a unique parallel hybrid action space that allows for the simultaneous output of each action and its optimal parameters, streamlining the decision-making process. Furthermore, to ascertain the robustness and effectiveness of this approach, we executed ablation studies focusing on the utilization of a random action parameter mask within the critic network, which decouples the parameter space for individual actions, facilitating the use of preferable parameters for each action. The results from these studies confirm the efficacy of this method, distinctly enhancing real-world applicability</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungwon Lim, Sungwoong Kim, Jihwan Yu, Sungjae Lee, Jiwan Chung, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Escape rooms present a unique cognitive challenge that demands exploration-driven planning: players should actively search their environment, continuously update their knowledge based on new discoveries, and connect disparate clues to determine which elements are relevant to their objectives. Motivated by this, we introduce VisEscape, a benchmark of 20 virtual escape rooms specifically designed to evaluate AI models under these challenging conditions, where success depends not only on solving isolated puzzles but also on iteratively constructing and refining spatial-temporal knowledge of a dynamically changing environment. On VisEscape, we observed that even state-of-the-art multimodal models generally fail to escape the rooms, showing considerable variation in their levels of progress and trajectories. To address this issue, we propose VisEscaper, which effectively integrates Memory, Feedback, and ReAct modules, demonstrating significant improvements by performing 3.7 times more effectively and 5.0 times more efficiently on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shraddha Surana, Ashwin Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.</p>

Ziegler, Elizabeth Barnes, Lawrence Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luciano Baresi, Davide Yi Xian Hu, Andrea Stocco, Paolo Tonella</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation-based testing is widely used to assess the reliability of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), but its effectiveness is limited by the operational design domain (ODD) conditions available in such simulators. To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhas S Kowshik, Abhishek Divekar, Vijit Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in diverse tasks using zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Even though their capabilities of data synthesis have been studied well in recent years, the generated data suffers from a lack of diversity, less adherence to the prompt, and potential biases that creep into the data from the generator model. In this work, we tackle the challenge of generating datasets with high diversity, upon which a student model is trained for downstream tasks. Taking the route of decoding-time guidance-based approaches, we propose CorrSynth, which generates data that is more diverse and faithful to the input prompt using a correlated sampling strategy. Further, our method overcomes the complexity drawbacks of some other guidance-based techniques like classifier-based guidance. With extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our approach and substantiate our claims. In particular, we perform intrinsic evaluation to show the improvements in diversity. Our experiments show that CorrSynth improves both student metrics and intrinsic metrics upon competitive baselines across four datasets, showing the innate advantage of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Rondina, Antonio Vetr\`o, Juan Carlos De Martin</p>
<p>Abstract: ML/AI is the field of computer science and computer engineering that arguably received the most attention and funding over the last decade. Data is the key element of ML/AI, so it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that users are fully aware of the quality of the datasets that they use, and of the process generating them, so that possible negative impacts on downstream effects can be tracked, analysed, and, where possible, mitigated. One of the tools that can be useful in this perspective is dataset documentation. The aim of this work is to investigate the state of dataset documentation practices, measuring the completeness of the documentation of several popular datasets in ML/AI repositories. We created a dataset documentation schema -- the Documentation Test Sheet (DTS) -- that identifies the information that should always be attached to a dataset (to ensure proper dataset choice and informed use), according to relevant studies in the literature. We verified 100 popular datasets from four different repositories with the DTS to investigate which information was present. Overall, we observed a lack of relevant documentation, especially about the context of data collection and data processing, highlighting a paucity of transparency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinfeng Wang, Yanhao Huang, Sifan Song, Boqian Wang, Jionglong Su, Jiaman Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: EEG emotion recognition faces significant hurdles due to noise interference, signal nonstationarity, and the inherent complexity of brain activity which make accurately emotion classification. In this study, we present the Fourier Adjacency Transformer, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates Fourier-based periodic analysis with graph-driven structural modeling. Our method first leverages novel Fourier-inspired modules to extract periodic features from embedded EEG signals, effectively decoupling them from aperiodic components. Subsequently, we employ an adjacency attention scheme to reinforce universal inter-channel correlation patterns, coupling these patterns with their sample-based counterparts. Empirical evaluations on SEED and DEAP datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an improvement of approximately 6.5% in recognition accuracy. By unifying periodicity and structural insights, this framework offers a promising direction for future research in EEG emotion analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Nolte, Mihai Pomarlan, Ayden Janssen, Daniel Be{\ss}ler, Kamyar Javanmardi, Sascha Jongebloed, Robert Porzel, John Bateman, Michael Beetz, Rainer Malaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by human cognition, metacognition has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance autonomy, adaptability, and robust learning in artificial agents. Yet research on Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) remains fragmented: diverse theories, terminologies, and design choices have led to disjointed developments and limited comparability across systems. Existing overviews and surveys often remain at a broad, conceptual level, making it difficult to synthesize deeper insights into the underlying algorithms and representations, and their respective success. We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review of how CMAs model, store, remember and process their metacognitive experiences, one of Flavell's (1979) three foundational components of metacognition. Following this organizing principle, we identify 35 CMAs that feature episodic introspective data ranging from symbolic event traces to sub-symbolic arousal metrics. We consider different aspects - ranging from the underlying psychological theories to the content and structure of collected data, to the algorithms used and evaluation results - and derive a unifying perspective that allows us to compare in depth how different Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) leverage metacognitive experiences for tasks such as error diagnosis, self-repair, and goal-driven learning. Our findings highlight both the promise of metacognitive experiences - in boosting adaptability, explainability, and overall system performance - and the persistent lack of shared standards or evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisoo Hong, Youngjin Jung, Jihwan Bae, Seungho Song, Sung-Woo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study developed an algorithm capable of detecting a reference line (a 0.2 mm thick piano wire) to accurately determine the position of an automated installation robot within an elevator shaft. A total of 3,245 images were collected from the experimental tower of H Company, the leading elevator manufacturer in South Korea, and the detection performance was evaluated using four experimental approaches (GCH, GSCH, GECH, FCH). During the initial image processing stage, Gaussian blurring, sharpening filter, embossing filter, and Fourier Transform were applied, followed by Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform. Notably, the method was developed to accurately extract the reference line by averaging the x-coordinates of the lines detected through the Hough Transform. This approach enabled the detection of the 0.2 mm thick piano wire with high accuracy, even in the presence of noise and other interfering factors (e.g., concrete cracks inside the elevator shaft or safety bars for filming equipment). The experimental results showed that Experiment 4 (FCH), which utilized Fourier Transform in the preprocessing stage, achieved the highest detection rate for the LtoL, LtoR, and RtoL datasets. Experiment 2(GSCH), which applied Gaussian blurring and a sharpening filter, demonstrated superior detection performance on the RtoR dataset. This study proposes a reference line detection algorithm that enables precise position calculation and control of automated robots in elevator shaft installation. Moreover, the developed method shows potential for applicability even in confined working spaces. Future work aims to develop a line detection algorithm equipped with machine learning-based hyperparameter tuning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZhongYi Zhang, ChenYang Xu, LiXuan Zhao, HuiRang Hou, QingHao Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive tool for real-time neural monitoring,widely used in depression detection via deep learning. However, existing models primarily focus on binary classification (depression/normal), lacking granularity for severity assessment. To address this, we proposed the DepL-GCN, i.e., Depression Level classification based on GCN model. This model tackles two key challenges: (1) subjectivity in depres-sion-level labeling due to patient self-report biases, and (2) class imbalance across severity categories. Inspired by the model learning patterns, we introduced two novel modules: the sample confidence module and the minority sample penalty module. The former leverages the L2-norm of prediction errors to progressively filter EEG samples with weak label alignment during training, thereby reducing the impact of subjectivity; the latter automatically upweights misclassified minority-class samples to address imbalance issues. After testing on two public EEG datasets, DepL-GCN achieved accuracies of 81.13% and 81.36% for multi-class severity recognition, outperforming baseline models.Ablation studies confirmed both modules' contributions. We further discussed the strengths and limitations of regression-based models for depression-level recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: When receiving radar pulses it is common for a recorded pulse train to contain pulses from many different emitters. The radar pulse deinterleaving problem is the task of separating out these pulses by the emitter from which they originated. Notably, the number of emitters in any particular recorded pulse train is considered unknown. In this paper, we define the problem and present metrics that can be used to measure model performance. We propose a metric learning approach to this problem using a transformer trained with the triplet loss on synthetic data. This model achieves strong results in comparison with other deep learning models with an adjusted mutual information score of 0.882.</p>

<p>Abstract: Calculating percentage bone loss is a critical test for periodontal disease staging but is sometimes imprecise and time consuming when manually calculated. This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module adjusts predicted keypoints correctly but is dependent on a minimum quality of prediction by the pose detection and segmentation models.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for real-time onboard terrain classification from Sentinel-1 (S1) level-0 raw In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) data, leveraging a Stacked Intelligent Metasurface (SIM) to perform inference directly in the analog wave domain. Unlike conventional digital deep neural networks, the proposed multi-layer Diffractive Deep Neural Network (D$^2$NN) setup implements automatic feature extraction as electromagnetic waves propagate through stacked metasurface layers. This design not only reduces reliance on expensive downlink bandwidth and high-power computing at terrestrial stations but also achieves performance levels around 90\% directly from the real raw IQ data, in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. Our method therefore helps bridge the gap between next-generation remote sensing tasks and in-orbit processing needs, paving the way for computationally efficient remote sensing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Ding, Elisa Donati, Haobo Li, Hadi Heidari</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable health devices have a strong demand in real-time biomedical signal processing. However traditional methods often require data transmission to centralized processing unit with substantial computational resources after collecting it from edge devices. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging field that seeks to design specialized hardware for computing systems inspired by the structure, function, and dynamics of the human brain, offering significant advantages in latency and power consumption. This paper explores a novel neuromorphic implementation approach for gesture recognition by extracting spatiotemporal spiking information from surface electromyography (sEMG) data in an event-driven manner. At the same time, the network was designed by implementing a simple-structured and hardware-friendly Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) framework called Rotating Neuron Reservoir (RNR) within the domain of Spiking neural network (SNN). The spiking RNR (sRNR) is promising to pipeline an innovative solution to compact embedded wearable systems, enabling low-latency, real-time processing directly at the sensor level. The proposed system was validated by an open-access large-scale sEMG database and achieved an average classification accuracy of 74.6\% and 80.3\% using a classical machine learning classifier and a delta learning rule algorithm respectively. While the delta learning rule could be fully spiking and implementable on neuromorphic chips, the proposed gesture recognition system demonstrates the potential for near-sensor low-latency processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheyi Chen, Sijin Huang, Geyong Min, Zhaolong Ning, Jie Li, Yan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers low-latency and high-bandwidth support for Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) applications. However, due to high vehicle mobility and finite communication coverage of base stations, it is hard to maintain uninterrupted and high-quality services without proper service migration among MEC servers. Existing solutions commonly rely on prior knowledge and rarely consider efficient resource allocation during the service migration process, making it hard to reach optimal performance in dynamic IoV environments. To address these important challenges, we propose SR-CL, a novel mobility-aware seamless Service migration and Resource allocation framework via Convex-optimization-enabled deep reinforcement Learning in multi-edge IoV systems. First, we decouple the Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem of service migration and resource allocation into two sub-problems. Next, we design a new actor-critic-based asynchronous-update deep reinforcement learning method to handle service migration, where the delayed-update actor makes migration decisions and the one-step-update critic evaluates the decisions to guide the policy update. Notably, we theoretically derive the optimal resource allocation with convex optimization for each MEC server, thereby further improving system performance. Using the real-world datasets of vehicle trajectories and testbed, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SR-CL. Compared to benchmark methods, the SR-CL achieves superior convergence and delay performance under various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucheng Suo, Fan Ma, Kaixin Shen, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instructions for long-horizon tasks are crucial as they intuitively clarify complex concepts and enhance retention across extended steps. Directly generating a series of images using text-to-image models without considering the context of previous steps results in inconsistent images, increasing cognitive load. Additionally, the generated images often miss objects or the attributes such as color, shape, and state of the objects are inaccurate. To address these challenges, we propose LIGER, the first training-free framework for Long-horizon Instruction GEneration with logic and attribute self-Reflection. LIGER first generates a draft image for each step with the historical prompt and visual memory of previous steps. This step-by-step generation approach maintains consistency between images in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, LIGER utilizes various image editing tools to rectify errors including wrong attributes, logic errors, object redundancy, and identity inconsistency in the draft images. Through this self-reflection mechanism, LIGER improves the logic and object attribute correctness of the images. To verify whether the generated images assist human understanding, we manually curated a new benchmark consisting of various long-horizon tasks. Human-annotated ground truth expressions reflect the human-defined criteria for how an image should appear to be illustrative. Experiments demonstrate the visual instructions generated by LIGER are more comprehensive compared with baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rujia Wang, Xiangbo Gao, Hao Xiang, Runsheng Xu, Zhengzhong Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception enhances each agent perceptual capabilities by sharing sensing information to cooperatively perform robot perception tasks. This approach has proven effective in addressing challenges such as sensor deficiencies, occlusions, and long-range perception. However, existing representative collaborative perception systems transmit intermediate feature maps, such as bird-eye view (BEV) representations, which contain a significant amount of non-critical information, leading to high communication bandwidth requirements. To enhance communication efficiency while preserving perception capability, we introduce CoCMT, an object-query-based collaboration framework that optimizes communication bandwidth by selectively extracting and transmitting essential features. Within CoCMT, we introduce the Efficient Query Transformer (EQFormer) to effectively fuse multi-agent object queries and implement a synergistic deep supervision to enhance the positive reinforcement between stages, leading to improved overall performance. Experiments on OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets show CoCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods while drastically reducing communication needs. On V2V4Real, our model (Top-50 object queries) requires only 0.416 Mb bandwidth, 83 times less than SOTA methods, while improving AP70 by 1.1 percent. This efficiency breakthrough enables practical collaborative perception deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments without sacrificing detection accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative pretrained transformers (GPT) are the common large language models (LLMs) used for generating text from natural language inputs. However, the fixed properties of language parameters in individual LLMs can lead to inconsistencies in the generated outputs. This limitation also restricts the models' ability to represent diverse language patterns due to inherent biases. Moreover, many powerful LLMs are closed-source. This prevents organizations from integrating their data into these systems, raising concerns about data privacy and limiting industry applications. Inspired by the successful application of LLM ensemble models in text generation, recent literature has also investigated their potential in code generation. This article reviews these emerging LLM ensemble approaches. Our goal is to enhance readers' understanding of existing techniques and encourage further research and practical implementation, aiming to expand the real-world applications of LLM ensemble models in both text and code generation. We categorize these approaches into seven main methods: weight merging, knowledge fusion, mixture of experts, reward ensemble, output ensemble, routing, and cascading. From this list, we focus on four methods and models that show strong performance and potential for broader applications. We analyze their modeling steps, training methods, and output features to provide a clear understanding of their capabilities. Our findings highlight the benefits of LLM ensemble techniques. These include better representation of diversity, improved output quality, and greater flexibility in applications. This information offers valuable insights for selecting models for various real-world tasks involving text and code generation, and potentially applying methods to multimodal LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our analysis of the NeurIPS 2023 large language model (LLM) fine-tuning competition revealed the following trend: top-performing models exhibit significant overfitting on benchmark datasets, mirroring the broader issue of benchmark overfitting on popular leaderboards and that data curation is essential in order to get a high performing LLM. The competition, which consisted of two stages - an open evaluation stage with publicly available tasks and a closed evaluation stage with unseen tasks - allowed us to assess the generalizability of fine-tuned LLMs. Our results highlight the limitations of current benchmark-based evaluation schemes for generative models and demonstrate the need for more robust evaluation methods. Notably, the winning submissions utilized standard open-source libraries and focused primarily on data curation. To facilitate further research and promote reproducibility, we release all competition entries, Docker files, and evaluation infrastructure, providing a valuable resource for the community to explore fine-tuning, overfitting, and reproducibility in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks is frequently cited as proof of their medical capabilities. We hypothesized that LLM performance on medical MCQs may in part be illusory and driven by factors beyond medical content knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To assess this, we created a novel benchmark of free-response questions with paired MCQs (FreeMedQA). Using this benchmark, we evaluated three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, and LLama-3-70B-instruct) and found an average absolute deterioration of 39.43% in performance on free-response questions relative to multiple-choice (p = 1.3 * 10-5) which was greater than the human performance decline of 22.29%. To isolate the role of the MCQ format on performance, we performed a masking study, iteratively masking out parts of the question stem. At 100% masking, the average LLM multiple-choice performance was 6.70% greater than random chance (p = 0.002) with one LLM (GPT-4o) obtaining an accuracy of 37.34%. Notably, for all LLMs the free-response performance was near zero. Our results highlight the shortcomings in medical MCQ benchmarks for overestimating the capabilities of LLMs in medicine, and, broadly, the potential for improving both human and machine assessments using LLM-evaluated free-response questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishal Gandhi, Sagar Gandhi</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet the influence of prompt sentiment, a latent affective characteristic of input text, remains underexplored. This study systematically examines how sentiment variations in prompts affect LLM-generated outputs in terms of coherence, factuality, and bias. Leveraging both lexicon-based and transformer-based sentiment analysis methods, we categorize prompts and evaluate responses from five leading LLMs: Claude, DeepSeek, GPT-4, Gemini, and LLaMA. Our analysis spans six AI-driven applications, including content generation, conversational AI, legal and financial analysis, healthcare AI, creative writing, and technical documentation. By transforming prompts, we assess their impact on output quality. Our findings reveal that prompt sentiment significantly influences model responses, with negative prompts often reducing factual accuracy and amplifying bias, while positive prompts tend to increase verbosity and sentiment propagation. These results highlight the importance of sentiment-aware prompt engineering for ensuring fair and reliable AI-generated content.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel strategy aimed at enhancing productivity and minimizing non-productive movements within container terminals, specifically focusing on container yards. It advocates for the implementation of a digital twin-based methodology to streamline the operations of stacking cranes (SCs) responsible for container handling. The proposed approach entails the creation of a virtual container yard that mirrors the physical yard within a digital twin system, facilitating real-time observation and validation. In addition, this article demonstrates the effectiveness of using a digital twin to reduce unproductive movements and improve productivity through simulation. It defines various operational strategies and takes into account different yard contexts, providing a comprehensive understanding of optimisation possibilities. By exploiting the capabilities of the digital twin, managers and operators are provided with crucial information on operational dynamics, enabling them to identify areas for improvement. This visualisation helps decision-makers to make informed choices about their stacking strategies, thereby improving the efficiency of overall container terminal operations. Overall, this paper present a digital twin solution in container terminal operations, offering a powerful tool for optimising productivity and minimising inefficiencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Qing Yu (University of Derby), Frank McQuade (Bloc Digital)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents RAG-KG-IL, a novel multi-agent hybrid framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with an Incremental Learning (IL) approach. Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific problem-solving involves synthesizing information while applying expert knowledge. We introduce CURIE, a scientific long-Context Understanding,Reasoning and Information Extraction benchmark to measure the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific problem-solving and assisting scientists in realistic workflows. This benchmark introduces ten challenging tasks with a total of 580 problems and solution pairs curated by experts in six disciplines - materials science, condensed matter physics, quantum computing, geospatial analysis, biodiversity, and proteins - covering both experimental and theoretical work-flows in science. We evaluate a range of closed and open LLMs on tasks in CURIE which requires domain expertise, comprehension of long in-context information,and multi-step reasoning. While Gemini Flash 2.0 and Claude-3 show consistent high comprehension across domains, the popular GPT-4o and command-R+ fail dramatically on protein sequencing tasks. With the best performance at 32% there is much room for improvement for all models. We hope that insights gained from CURIE can guide the future development of LLMs in sciences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingying Zeng, Zhenwei Dai, Hui Liu, Samarth Varshney, Zhiji Liu, Chen Luo, Zhen Li, Qi He, Xianfeng Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting LLMs offers an efficient way to guide output generation without explicit model training. In the e-commerce domain, prompting-based applications are widely used for tasks such as query understanding, recommender systems, and customer support. However, adapting LLMs to different tasks often requires extensive prompt engineering by domain experts, along with frequent updates to align with evolving business needs. Additionally, crafting fully unbiased natural language prompts remains a challenge for humans. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Examples as the Prompt (EaP) which leverages labeled data to enhance prompts. Specifically, EaP automatically selects the most representative examples to maximize the few-shot capability of LLMs. It is efficient due to its unsupervised example selection and adaptive to potential data distribution shifts. We validate EaP on four real-world production use cases, demonstrating that it achieves comparable or even superior performance comparing to hand-crafted prompts designed by domain experts. Additionally, we introduce EaP_lite, which entirely replaces the natural language components of prompts with labeled examples. EaP_lite improves LLM inference speed by up to 70% without compromising performance. Latest online A/B test shows that using EaP and EaP_lite for data labeling can bring significant composite revenue gain by 0.06%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojian Li, Yongkang Leng, Ruiqing Ding, Hangjie Mo, Shanlin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The human-like reasoning capabilities exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) challenge the traditional neural network theory's understanding of the flexibility of fixed-parameter systems. This paper proposes the "Cognitive Activation" theory, revealing the essence of LLMs' reasoning mechanisms from the perspective of dynamic systems: the model's reasoning ability stems from a chaotic process of dynamic information extraction in the parameter space. By introducing the Quasi-Lyapunov Exponent (QLE), we quantitatively analyze the chaotic characteristics of the model at different layers. Experiments show that the model's information accumulation follows a nonlinear exponential law, and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) accounts for a higher proportion in the final output than the attention mechanism. Further experiments indicate that minor initial value perturbations will have a substantial impact on the model's reasoning ability, confirming the theoretical analysis that large language models are chaotic systems. This research provides a chaos theory framework for the interpretability of LLMs' reasoning and reveals potential pathways for balancing creativity and reliability in model design.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of multimodal generative AI is transforming the intersection of technology and art, offering deeper insights into large-scale artwork. Although its creative capabilities have been widely explored, its potential to represent artwork in latent spaces remains underexamined. We use cutting-edge generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, to analyze 500 years of Western paintings by extracting two types of latent information with the model: formal aspects (e.g., colors) and contextual aspects (e.g., subject). Our findings reveal that contextual information differentiates between artistic periods, styles, and individual artists more successfully than formal elements. Additionally, using contextual keywords extracted from paintings, we show how artistic expression evolves alongside societal changes. Our generative experiment, infusing prospective contexts into historical artworks, successfully reproduces the evolutionary trajectory of artworks, highlighting the significance of mutual interaction between society and art. This study demonstrates how multimodal AI expands traditional formal analysis by integrating temporal, cultural, and historical contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in the filed of education, there is a growing need for mathematics teacher education students (MTES) to demonstrate proficiency in the integration of AI with the technological pedagogical content knowledge (AI-TPACK). To study the issue, we firstly devised an systematic AI-TPACK scale and test on 412 MTES from seven universities. Through descriptive statistical analyses, we found that the current status of AI-TPACK for MTES in China is at a basic, preliminary stage. Secondly, we compared MTES between three different grades on the six variables and found that there is no discernible difference, which suggested that graduate studies were observed to have no promotion in the development of AI-TPACK competencies. Thirdly, we proposed a new AI-TPACK structural equation model (AI-TPACK-SEM) to explore the impact of self-efficacy and teaching beliefs on AI-TPACK. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between self-efficacy and AI-TPACK. We also come to a conclusion that may be contrary to common perception, excessive teaching beliefs may impede the advancement of AI-TPACK. Overall, this paper revealed the current status of AI-TPACK for MTES in China for the first time, designed a dedicated SEM to study the effect of specific factors on AI-TPACK, and proposed some suggestions on future developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meijuan Xie, Liling Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has brought about a notable surge in the field of education. The use of GAI to support learning is becoming increasingly prevalent among students. However, the manner and extent of its utilisation vary considerably from one individual to another. And researches about student's utilisation and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. To gain insight into the issue, this paper proposed a hybrid-survey method to examine the impact of GAI on students across four different grades in six key areas (LIPSAL): learning interest, independent learning, problem solving, self-confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Firstly, through questionnaire, we found that among LIPSAL, GAI has the greatest impact on the concept of appropriate use, the lowest level of learning interest and self-confidence. Secondly, a comparison of four grades revealed that the high and low factors of LIPSAL exhibited grade-related variation, and college students exhibited a higher level than high school students across LIPSAL. Thirdly, through interview, the students demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the application of GAI. We found that students have a positive attitude towards GAI and are very willing to use it, which is why GAI has grown so rapidly in popularity. They also told us prospects and challenges in using GAI. In the future, as GAI matures technologically, it will have an greater impact on students. These findings may help better understand usage by different students and inform future research in digital education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siliang Zeng, Yao Liu, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis, Mingyi Hong, Rasool Fakoor</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the challenges of aligning large models with human preferences lies in both the data requirements and the technical complexities of current approaches. Predominant methods, such as RLHF, involve multiple steps, each demanding distinct types of data, including demonstration data and preference data. In RLHF, human preferences are typically modeled through a reward model, which serves as a proxy to guide policy learning during the reinforcement learning stage, ultimately producing a policy aligned with human preferences. However, in this paper, we propose a fresh perspective on learning alignment based on inverse reinforcement learning principles, where the optimal policy is still derived from reward maximization. However, instead of relying on preference data, we directly learn the reward model from demonstration data. This new formulation offers the flexibility to be applied even when only demonstration data is available, a capability that current RLHF methods lack, and it also shows that demonstration data offers more utility than what conventional wisdom suggests. Our extensive evaluation, based on public reward benchmark, HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard and MT-Bench, demonstrates that our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods that rely solely on demonstration data.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study proposes a hybrid model based on Transformers, named MSCMHMST, aimed at addressing key challenges in traffic flow prediction. Traditional single-method approaches show limitations in traffic prediction tasks, whereas hybrid methods, by integrating the strengths of different models, can provide more accurate and robust predictions. The MSCMHMST model introduces a multi-head, multi-scale attention mechanism, allowing the model to parallel process different parts of the data and learn its intrinsic representations from multiple perspectives, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex situations. This mechanism enables the model to capture features at various scales effectively, understanding both short-term changes and long-term trends. Verified through experiments on the PeMS04/08 dataset with specific experimental settings, the MSCMHMST model demonstrated excellent robustness and accuracy in long, medium, and short-term traffic flow predictions. The results indicate that this model has significant potential, offering a new and effective solution for the field of traffic flow prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lulu Ban, Tao Zhu, Xiangqing Lu, Qi Qiu, Wenyong Han, Shuangjian Li, Liming Chen, Kevin I-Kai Wang, Mingxing Nie, Yaping Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-dataset Human Activity Recognition (HAR) suffers from limited model generalization, hindering its practical deployment. To address this critical challenge, inspired by the success of DoReMi in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a data mixture optimization strategy for pre-training HAR models, aiming to improve the recognition performance across heterogeneous datasets. However, directly applying DoReMi to the HAR field encounters new challenges due to the continuous, multi-channel and intrinsic heterogeneous characteristics of IMU sensor data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework HAR-DoReMi, which introduces a masked reconstruction task based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. By raplacing the discrete language sequence prediction task, which relies on the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss, in the original DoReMi framework, the proposed framework is inherently more appropriate for handling the continuous and multi-channel characteristics of IMU data. In addition, HAR-DoReMi integrates the Mahony fusion algorithm into the self-supervised HAR pre-training, aiming to mitigate the heterogeneity of varying sensor orientation. This is achieved by estimating the sensor orientation within each dataset and facilitating alignment with a unified coordinate system, thereby improving the cross-dataset generalization ability of the HAR model. Experimental evaluation on multiple cross-dataset HAR transfer tasks demonstrates that HAR-DoReMi improves the accuracy by an average of 6.51%, compared to the current state-of-the-art method with only approximately 30% to 50% of the data usage. These results confirm the effectiveness of HAR-DoReMi in improving the generalization and data efficiency of pre-training HAR models, underscoring its significant potential to facilitate the practical deployment of HAR technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghao Wu, Jianwei Niu, Xuefeng Liu, Guogang Zhu, Jiayuan Zhang, Shaojie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Prototype Learning (FedPL) has emerged as an effective strategy for handling data heterogeneity in Federated Learning (FL). In FedPL, clients collaboratively construct a set of global feature centers (prototypes), and let local features align with these prototypes to mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity. The performance of FedPL highly depends on the quality of prototypes. Existing methods assume that larger inter-class distances among prototypes yield better performance, and thus design different methods to increase these distances. However, we observe that while these methods increase prototype distances to enhance class discrimination, they inevitably disrupt essential semantic relationships among classes, which are crucial for model generalization. This raises an important question: how to construct prototypes that inherently preserve semantic relationships among classes? Directly learning these relationships from limited and heterogeneous client data can be problematic in FL. Recently, the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrates their ability to capture semantic relationships from vast textual corpora. Motivated by this, we propose FedTSP, a novel method that leverages PLMs to construct semantically enriched prototypes from the textual modality, enabling more effective collaboration in heterogeneous data settings. We first use a large language model (LLM) to generate fine-grained textual descriptions for each class, which are then processed by a PLM on the server to form textual prototypes. To address the modality gap between client image models and the PLM, we introduce trainable prompts, allowing prototypes to adapt better to client tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTSP mitigates data heterogeneity while significantly accelerating convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a cutting-edge regional weather forecasting model based on the SwinTransformer 3D architecture. This model is specifically designed to deliver precise hourly weather predictions ranging from 1 hour to 5 days, significantly improving the reliability and practicality of short-term weather forecasts. Our model has demonstrated generally superior performance when compared to Pangu, a well-established global model. The evaluation indicates that our model excels in predicting most weather variables, highlighting its potential as a more effective alternative in the field of limited area modeling. A noteworthy feature of this model is the integration of enhanced boundary conditions, inspired by traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) techniques. This integration has substantially improved the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model includes an innovative approach for diagnosing hourly total precipitation at a high spatial resolution of approximately 5 kilometers. This is achieved through a latent diffusion model, offering an alternative method for generating high-resolution precipitation data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhang, Zhaohong Deng, Guanjin Wang, Kup-Sze Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning has emerged as a crucial focus in machine and deep learning, involving the extraction of meaningful and useful features and patterns from the input data, thereby enhancing the performance of various downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, and prediction. Current mainstream representation learning methods primarily rely on non-linear data mining techniques such as kernel methods and deep neural networks to extract abstract knowledge from complex datasets. However, most of these methods are black-box, lacking transparency and interpretability in the learning process, which constrains their practical utility. To this end, this paper introduces a novel representation learning method grounded in an interpretable fuzzy rule-based model. Specifically, it is built upon the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) to initially map input data to a high-dimensional fuzzy feature space through the antecedent part of the TSK-FS. Subsequently, a novel differentiable optimization method is proposed for the consequence part learning which can preserve the model's interpretability and transparency while further exploring the nonlinear relationships within the data. This optimization method retains the essence of traditional optimization, with certain parts of the process parameterized corresponding differentiable modules constructed, and a deep optimization process implemented. Consequently, this method not only enhances the model's performance but also ensures its interpretability. Moreover, a second-order geometry preservation method is introduced to further improve the robustness of the proposed method. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its potential for advancing representation learning methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronas Shakya, Farhad Vadiee, Mohammad Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a competitive landscape for AI-assisted programming tools. This study evaluates two leading models: ChatGPT 03-mini and DeepSeek-R1 on their ability to solve competitive programming tasks from Codeforces. Using 29 programming tasks of three levels of easy, medium, and hard difficulty, we assessed the outcome of both models by their accepted solutions, memory efficiency, and runtime performance. Our results indicate that while both models perform similarly on easy tasks, ChatGPT outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on medium-difficulty tasks, achieving a 54.5% success rate compared to DeepSeek 18.1%. Both models struggled with hard tasks, thus highlighting some ongoing challenges LLMs face in handling highly complex programming problems. These findings highlight key differences in both model capabilities and their computational power, offering valuable insights for developers and researchers working to advance AI-driven programming tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Khalil, Ronas Shakya, Qinyi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of data-driven applications in education such as in learning analytics and AI in education has raised significant privacy and data protection concerns. While these challenges have been widely discussed in previous works, there are still limited practical solutions. Federated learning has recently been discoursed as a promising privacy-preserving technique, yet its application in education remains scarce. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of federated learning for educational data prediction, comparing its performance to traditional non-federated approaches. Our findings indicate that federated learning achieves comparable predictive accuracy. Furthermore, under adversarial attacks, federated learning demonstrates greater resilience compared to non-federated settings. We summarise that our results reinforce the value of federated learning as a potential approach for balancing predictive performance and privacy in educational contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Wang, Zhangyi Jiang, Zhenqi He, Wenhan Yang, Yanan Zheng, Zeyu Li, Zifan He, Shenyang Tong, Hailei Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose a novel reward model approach, Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps from fine-grained and coarse-grained level. HRM performs better in assessing reasoning coherence and self-reflection, particularly when the previous reasoning step is incorrect. Furthermore, to address the inefficiency of autonomous generating PRM training data via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC) based on node merging (combining two consecutive reasoning steps into one step) in the tree structure. This approach diversifies MCTS results for HRM with negligible computational overhead, enhancing label robustness by introducing noise. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset demonstrate that HRM, in conjunction with HNC, achieves superior stability and reliability in evaluation compared to PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on MATH500 and GSM8K confirm HRM's superior generalization and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. The code for all experiments will be released at https: //github.com/tengwang0318/hierarchial_reward_model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp D. Siedler, Ian Gemp</p>
<p>Abstract: In complex multi-agent environments, achieving efficient learning and desirable behaviours is a significant challenge for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. This work explores the potential of combining MARL with Large Language Model (LLM)-mediated interventions to guide agents toward more desirable behaviours. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs can be used to interpret and facilitate interventions that shape the learning trajectories of multiple agents. We experimented with two types of interventions, referred to as controllers: a Natural Language (NL) Controller and a Rule-Based (RB) Controller. The NL Controller, which uses an LLM to simulate human-like interventions, showed a stronger impact than the RB Controller. Our findings indicate that agents particularly benefit from early interventions, leading to more efficient training and higher performance. Both intervention types outperform the baseline without interventions, highlighting the potential of LLM-mediated guidance to accelerate training and enhance MARL performance in challenging environments.</p>

This article considers natural follow-up questions that could arise from that experiment, such as: what is the extent of this phenomenon?

The article considers virtual elections in ten european countries: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, and Sweden, and with four different LLMs: gpt4o, claude 3.5 sonnet, mistral-large, and gemini-2.0-flash.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joe McIntyre</p>
<p>Abstract: The early 2020s has seen the rise of two strange and potentially quite impactful social phenomena, namely pseudolaw, where users rely upon pseudolegal arguments that mimic the form and ritual of legal argumentation but fundamentally distort the content of law, and generative AI/LLMs, which generate content that uses probabilistic calculations to create outputs that look like human generated text. This article argues that the juxtaposition of the two phenomena helps to reveal that they both share two fundamental traits as both elevate form and appearance over substance and content, and users of both routinely mistake the form for the substance. In drawing upon legal theory, computer science, linguistics and cognitive psychology, the article argues that both phenomena rely upon creating illusions of meaning that users mistake for the underlying primary phenomenon. I then explore four implications of this conception of both phenomena. Firstly, both rely on human tendencies of conceptual pareidolia resulting in the erroneous perception of meaningful linguistic legal patterns from nebulous inputs. Secondly, both rely upon the confidence heuristic, the human cognitive bias for treating confidence as a proxy for competence. Thirdly, both succeed when the primary concern is with the form of the output and not its content. Fourthly, both rely heavily upon the magical thinking of users and the desire for the promise of the approach to be real. The article argues that the legal context helps to reveal a solution for the problems caused by both phenomena as it is only where users possess sufficient legal and technological literacy that it becomes possible to reveal to them the illusionary nature of the phenomena.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13557">APF+: Boosting adaptive-potential function reinforcement learning methods with a W-shaped network for high-dimensional games</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Chen, Lambert Schomaker</p>
<p>Abstract: Studies in reward shaping for reinforcement learning (RL) have flourished in recent years due to its ability to speed up training. Our previous work proposed an adaptive potential function (APF) and showed that APF can accelerate the Q-learning with a Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm in the low-dimensional domain. This paper proposes to extend APF with an encoder (APF+) for RL state representation, allowing applying APF to the pixel-based Atari games using a state-encoding method that projects high-dimensional game's pixel frames to low-dimensional embeddings. We approach by designing the state-representation encoder as a W-shaped network (W-Net), by using which we are able to encode both the background as well as the moving entities in the game frames. Specifically, the embeddings derived from the pre-trained W-Net consist of two latent vectors: One represents the input state, and the other represents the deviation of the input state's representation from itself. We then incorporate W-Net into APF to train a downstream Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN), obtain the APF-WNet-DDQN, and demonstrate its effectiveness in Atari game-playing tasks. To evaluate the APF+W-Net module in such high-dimensional tasks, we compare with two types of baseline methods: (i) the basic DDQN; and (ii) two encoder-replaced APF-DDQN methods where we replace W-Net by (a) an unsupervised state representation method called Spatiotemporal Deep Infomax (ST-DIM) and (b) a ground truth state representation provided by the Atari Annotated RAM Interface (ARI). The experiment results show that out of 20 Atari games, APF-WNet-DDQN outperforms DDQN (14/20 games) and APF-STDIM-DDQN (13/20 games) significantly. In comparison against the APF-ARI-DDQN which employs embeddings directly of the detailed game-internal state information, the APF-WNet-DDQN achieves a comparable performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Xue, Longfei Wei, Fang Sheng, Yuxin Gao, Jianfei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of RUL for lithium-ion batteries is crucial for enhancing the reliability and longevity of energy storage systems. Traditional methods for RUL prediction often struggle with issues such as data sparsity, varying battery chemistries, and the inability to capture complex degradation patterns over time. In this study, we propose a survival analysis-based framework combined with deep learning models to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, we utilize five advanced models: the Cox-type models (Cox, CoxPH, and CoxTime) and two machine-learning-based models (DeepHit and MTLR). These models address the challenges of accurate RUL estimation by transforming raw time-series battery data into survival data, including key degradation indicators such as voltage, current, and internal resistance. Advanced feature extraction techniques enhance the model's robustness in diverse real-world scenarios, including varying charging conditions and battery chemistries. Our models are tested using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and minimizing overfitting. Experimental results show that our survival-based framework significantly improves RUL prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for battery management and maintenance optimization. This study contributes to the advancement of predictive maintenance in battery technology, offering valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance the operational lifespan of lithium-ion batteries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin-Han Jia, Lan-Zhe Guo, Zhi Zhou, Si-Ye Han, Zi-Wen Li, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world text classification tasks, negative texts often contain a minimal proportion of negative content, which is especially problematic in areas like text quality control, legal risk screening, and sensitive information interception. This challenge manifests at two levels: at the macro level, distinguishing negative texts is difficult due to the high similarity between coarse-grained positive and negative samples; at the micro level, the issue stems from extreme class imbalance and a lack of fine-grained labels. To address these challenges, we propose transforming the coarse-grained positive-negative (PN) classification task into an imbalanced fine-grained positive-unlabeled (PU) classification problem, supported by theoretical analysis. We introduce a novel framework, Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU) learning, which features a unique PU learning loss function that optimizes macro-level performance amidst severe imbalance at the micro level. The framework's performance is further boosted by rebalanced pseudo-labeling and threshold adjustment. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BFGPU, which outperforms other methods, even in extreme scenarios where both macro and micro levels are highly imbalanced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evangelos Georganas, Dhiraj Kalamkar, Alexander Kozlov, Alexander Heinecke</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a method to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing any accuracy over the 16-bit model inference. In a typical SD setup, the idea is to use a full-precision, small, fast model as "draft" to generate the next few tokens and use the "target" large model to verify the draft-generated tokens. The efficacy of this method heavily relies on the acceptance ratio of the draft-generated tokens and the relative token throughput of the draft versus the target model. Nevertheless, an efficient SD pipeline requires pre-training and aligning the draft model to the target model, making it impractical for LLM inference in a plug-and-play fashion. In this work, we propose using MXFP4 models as drafts in a plug-and-play fashion since the MXFP4 Weight-Only-Quantization (WOQ) merely direct-casts the BF16 target model weights to MXFP4. In practice, our plug-and-play solution gives speedups up to 2x over the BF16 baseline. Then we pursue an opportunity for further acceleration: the MXFP4 draft token generation itself can be accelerated via speculative decoding by using yet another smaller draft. We call our method ML-SpecQD: Multi-Level Speculative Decoding with Quantized Drafts since it recursively applies speculation for accelerating the draft-token generation. Combining Multi-Level Speculative Decoding with MXFP4 Quantized Drafts we outperform state-of-the-art speculative decoding, yielding speedups up to 2.72x over the BF16 baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are widely used for navigation, transportation, and inspection tasks indoors and outdoors. In practical situations of limited satellite signals or poor lighting conditions, navigation depends only on inertial sensors. In such cases, the navigation solution rapidly drifts due to inertial measurement errors. In this work, we propose WMINet a wheel-mounted inertial deep learning approach to estimate the mobile robot's position based only on its inertial sensors. To that end, we merge two common practical methods to reduce inertial drift: a wheel-mounted approach and driving the mobile robot in periodic trajectories. Additionally, we enforce a wheelbase constraint to further improve positioning performance. To evaluate our proposed approach we recorded using the Rosbot-XL a wheel-mounted initial dataset totaling 190 minutes, which is made publicly available. Our approach demonstrated a 66\% improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. As a consequence, our approach enables navigation in challenging environments and bridges the pure inertial gap. This enables seamless robot navigation using only inertial sensors for short periods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram data, one of the most widely available biosignal data, has become increasingly valuable with the emergence of deep learning methods, providing novel insights into cardiovascular diseases and broader health conditions. However, heterogeneity of electrocardiogram formats, limited access to deep learning model weights and intricate algorithmic steps for effective fine-tuning for own disease target labels result in complex workflows. In this work, we introduce ExChanGeAI, a web-based end-to-end platform that streamlines the reading of different formats, pre-processing, visualization and custom machine learning with local and privacy-preserving fine-tuning. ExChanGeAI is adaptable for use on both personal computers and scalable to high performance server environments. The platform offers state-of-the-art deep learning models for training from scratch, alongside our novel open-source electrocardiogram foundation model CardX, pre-trained on over one million electrocardiograms. Evaluation across three external validation sets, including an entirely new testset extracted from routine care, demonstrate the fine-tuning capabilities of ExChanGeAI. CardX outperformed the benchmark foundation model while requiring significantly fewer parameters and lower computational resources. The platform enables users to empirically determine the most suitable model for their specific tasks based on systematic validations.The code is available at https://imigitlab.uni-muenster.de/published/exchangeai .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Tong, Kang Pan, Xiao Zhang, Erli Meng, Run He, Yawen Cui, Nuoyan Guo, Huiping Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess encompassing capabilities that can process diverse language-related tasks. However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(ASR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect retention of prior knowledge while seamlessly integrating new information, effectively overcoming the core limitations of existing methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lameness and gait irregularities are significant concerns in equine health management, affecting performance, welfare, and economic value. Traditional observational methods rely on subjective expert assessments, which can lead to inconsistencies in detecting subtle or early-stage lameness. While AI-based approaches have emerged, many require multiple sensors, force plates, or video systems, making them costly and impractical for field deployment. In this applied research study, we present a stride-level classification system that utilizes a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) to objectively differentiate between sound and lame horses, with a primary focus on the trot gait. The proposed system was tested under real-world conditions, achieving a 90% session-level accuracy with no false positives, demonstrating its robustness for practical applications. By employing a single, non-intrusive, and readily available sensor, our approach significantly reduces the complexity and cost of hardware requirements while maintaining high classification performance. These results highlight the potential of our CNN-based method as a field-tested, scalable solution for automated lameness detection. By enabling early diagnosis, this system offers a valuable tool for preventing minor gait irregularities from developing into severe conditions, ultimately contributing to improved equine welfare and performance in veterinary and equestrian practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhyeon Hong, Soojin Choi, Chaelin Kim, Sihun Cha, Junyong Noh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the growing accessibility of skeletal motion data, integrating it for animating character meshes remains challenging due to diverse configurations of both skeletons and meshes. Specifically, the body scale and bone lengths of the skeleton should be adjusted in accordance with the size and proportions of the mesh, ensuring that all joints are accurately positioned within the character mesh. Furthermore, defining skinning weights is complicated by variations in skeletal configurations, such as the number of joints and their hierarchy, as well as differences in mesh configurations, including their connectivity and shapes. While existing approaches have made efforts to automate this process, they hardly address the variations in both skeletal and mesh configurations. In this paper, we present a novel method for the automatic rigging and skinning of character meshes using skeletal motion data, accommodating arbitrary configurations of both meshes and skeletons. The proposed method predicts the optimal skeleton aligned with the size and proportion of the mesh as well as defines skinning weights for various mesh-skeleton configurations, without requiring explicit supervision tailored to each of them. By incorporating Diffusion 3D Features (Diff3F) as semantic descriptors of character meshes, our method achieves robust generalization across different configurations. To assess the performance of our method in comparison to existing approaches, we conducted comprehensive evaluations encompassing both quantitative and qualitative analyses, specifically examining the predicted skeletons, skinning weights, and deformation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automating unit test generation remains a significant challenge, particularly for complex methods in real-world projects. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures. To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases. Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Meng, Jin Peng Zhou, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Hadas Kress-Gazit</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents INPROVF, an automatic framework that combines large language models (LLMs) and formal methods to speed up the repair process of high-level robot controllers. Previous approaches based solely on formal methods are computationally expensive and cannot scale to large state spaces. In contrast, INPROVF uses LLMs to generate repair candidates, and formal methods to verify their correctness. To improve the quality of these candidates, our framework first translates the symbolic representations of the environment and controllers into natural language descriptions. If a candidate fails the verification, INPROVF provides feedback on potential unsafe behaviors or unsatisfied tasks, and iteratively prompts LLMs to generate improved solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of INPROVF through 12 violations with various workspaces, tasks, and state space sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Logan Engstrom, Andrew Ilyas, Benjamin Chen, Axel Feldmann, William Moses, Aleksander Madry</p>
<p>Abstract: A major challenge in training large-scale machine learning models is configuring the training process to maximize model performance, i.e., finding the best training setup from a vast design space. In this work, we unlock a gradient-based approach to this problem. We first introduce an algorithm for efficiently calculating metagradients -- gradients through model training -- at scale. We then introduce a "smooth model training" framework that enables effective optimization using metagradients. With metagradient descent (MGD), we greatly improve on existing dataset selection methods, outperform accuracy-degrading data poisoning attacks by an order of magnitude, and automatically find competitive learning rate schedules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krti Tallam</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of integrated systems that merge computational prowess with human decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textbf{Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence (ODI)}, a novel paradigm that reconceptualizes AI not as isolated autonomous agents, but as cohesive, orchestrated networks that work in tandem with human expertise. ODI leverages advanced orchestration layers, multi-loop feedback mechanisms, and a high cognitive density framework to transform static, record-keeping systems into dynamic, action-oriented environments. Through a comprehensive review of multi-agent system literature, recent technological advances, and practical insights from industry forums, we argue that the future of AI lies in integrating distributed intelligence within human-centric workflows. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency and strategic agility but also addresses challenges related to scalability, transparency, and ethical decision-making. Our work outlines key theoretical implications and presents a practical roadmap for future research and enterprise innovation, aiming to pave the way for responsible and adaptive AI systems that drive sustainable innovation in human organizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitrii Usenko, David Helman, Chen Giladi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate estimation of total leaf area (TLA) is crucial for evaluating plant growth, photosynthetic activity, and transpiration. However, it remains challenging for bushy plants like dwarf tomatoes due to their complex canopies. Traditional methods are often labor-intensive, damaging to plants, or limited in capturing canopy complexity. This study evaluated a non-destructive method combining sequential 3D reconstructions from RGB images and machine learning to estimate TLA for three dwarf tomato cultivars: Mohamed, Hahms Gelbe Topftomate, and Red Robin -- grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two experiments (spring-summer and autumn-winter) included 73 plants, yielding 418 TLA measurements via an "onion" approach. High-resolution videos were recorded, and 500 frames per plant were used for 3D reconstruction. Point clouds were processed using four algorithms (Alpha Shape, Marching Cubes, Poisson's, Ball Pivoting), and meshes were evaluated with seven regression models: Multivariable Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. The Alpha Shape reconstruction ($\alpha = 3$) with Extreme Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance ($R^2 = 0.80$, $MAE = 489 cm^2$). Cross-experiment validation showed robust results ($R^2 = 0.56$, $MAE = 579 cm^2$). Feature importance analysis identified height, width, and surface area as key predictors. This scalable, automated TLA estimation method is suited for urban farming and precision agriculture, offering applications in automated pruning, resource efficiency, and sustainable food production. The approach demonstrated robustness across variable environmental conditions and canopy structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonesh Shrestha</p>
<p>Abstract: This research evaluates the extent to which modern AI frameworks, specifically TensorFlow and scikit-learn, adhere to the SOLID design principles - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. Analyzing the frameworks architectural documentation and design philosophies, this research investigates architectural trade-offs when balancing software engineering best practices with AI-specific needs. I examined each frameworks documentation, source code, and architectural components to evaluate their adherence to these principles. The results show that both frameworks adopt certain aspects of SOLID design principles but make intentional trade-offs to address performance, scalability, and the experimental nature of AI development. TensorFlow focuses on performance and scalability, sometimes sacrificing strict adherence to principles like Single Responsibility and Interface Segregation. While scikit-learns design philosophy aligns more closely with SOLID principles through consistent interfaces and composition principles, sticking closer to SOLID guidelines but with occasional deviations for performance optimizations and scalability. This research discovered that applying SOLID principles in AI frameworks depends on context, as performance, scalability, and flexibility often require deviations from traditional software engineering principles. This research contributes to understanding how domain-specific constraints influence architectural decisions in modern AI frameworks and how these frameworks strategically adapted design choices to effectively balance these contradicting requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipin Khati, Yijin Liu, David N. Palacio, Yixuan Zhang, Denys Poshyvanyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly growing in industry and academia for various software engineering (SE) tasks. As these models become more integral to critical processes, ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness becomes essential. Consequently, the concept of trust in these systems is becoming increasingly critical. Well-calibrated trust is important, as excessive trust can lead to security vulnerabilities, and risks, while insufficient trust can hinder innovation. However, the landscape of trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE is relatively unclear, with concepts such as trust, distrust, and trustworthiness lacking clear conceptualizations in the SE community. To bring clarity to the current research status and identify opportunities for future work, we conducted a comprehensive review of $88$ papers: a systematic literature review of $18$ papers focused on LLMs in SE, complemented by an analysis of 70 papers from broader trust literature. Additionally, we conducted a survey study with 25 domain experts to gain insights into practitioners' understanding of trust and identify gaps between existing literature and developers' perceptions. The result of our analysis serves as a roadmap that covers trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE and highlights areas for future exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Zhou, Shiyu Zhao, Yuxiao Chen, Zhenting Wang, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large foundation models trained on large-scale visual-text data can significantly enhance Open Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) through data generation. However, this may lead to biased synthetic data and overfitting to specific configurations. It can sidestep biases of manually curated data generation by directly leveraging hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), which is surprisingly rarely explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of a MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge transfer from LLMs to object detectors, an new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We demonstrate that intermediate hidden states from early LLM layers retain strong spatial-semantic correlations that are beneficial to grounding tasks. Experiments show that our adaptation strategy significantly enhances the performance on complex free-form text queries while remaining the same on plain categories. With our adaptation, Qwen2-0.5B with Swin-T as the vision encoder improves GroundingDINO by 2.33% on Omnilabel, at the overhead of 8.7% more GFLOPs. Qwen2-0.5B with a larger vision encoder can further boost the performance by 6.22%. We further validate our design by ablating on varied adapter architectures, sizes of LLMs, and which layers to add adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Khakpour, Lucia Florescu, Richard Tilley, Haibo Jiang, K. Swaminathan Iyer, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: The clinical translation of nanoparticle-based treatments remains limited due to the unpredictability of (nanoparticle) NP pharmacokinetics$\unicode{x2014}$how they distribute, accumulate, and clear from the body. Predicting these behaviours is challenging due to complex biological interactions and the difficulty of obtaining high-quality experimental datasets. Existing AI-driven approaches rely heavily on data-driven learning but fail to integrate crucial knowledge about NP properties and biodistribution mechanisms. We introduce a multi-view deep learning framework that enhances pharmacokinetic predictions by incorporating prior knowledge of key NP properties such as size and charge into a cross-attention mechanism, enabling context-aware feature selection and improving generalization despite small datasets. To further enhance prediction robustness, we employ an ensemble learning approach, combining deep learning with XGBoost (XGB) and Random Forest (RF), which significantly outperforms existing AI models. Our interpretability analysis reveals key physicochemical properties driving NP biodistribution, providing biologically meaningful insights into possible mechanisms governing NP behaviour in vivo rather than a black-box model. Furthermore, by bridging machine learning with physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, this work lays the foundation for data-efficient AI-driven drug discovery and precision nanomedicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangrui Pan, Xiaoyu Li, Yutao Dou, Qiya Song, Jiadi Luo, Qingchun Liang, Shaoliang Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) represents a newly identified aggressive pattern in lung cancer, which is known to be associated with adverse prognostic factors and complex pathological features. Pathologists currently rely on time consuming manual assessments, which are highly subjective and prone to variation. This highlights the urgent need for automated and precise diag nostic solutions. 2,970 lung cancer tissue slides are comprised from multiple centers, re-diagnosed them, and constructed and publicly released three lung cancer STAS datasets: STAS CSU (hospital), STAS TCGA, and STAS CPTAC. All STAS datasets provide corresponding pathological feature diagnoses and related clinical data. To address the bias, sparse and heterogeneous nature of STAS, we propose an scale-aware multiple instance learning(SMILE) method for STAS diagnosis of lung cancer. By introducing a scale-adaptive attention mechanism, the SMILE can adaptively adjust high attention instances, reducing over-reliance on local regions and promoting consistent detection of STAS lesions. Extensive experiments show that SMILE achieved competitive diagnostic results on STAS CSU, diagnosing 251 and 319 STAS samples in CPTAC andTCGA,respectively, surpassing clinical average AUC. The 11 open baseline results are the first to be established for STAS research, laying the foundation for the future expansion, interpretability, and clinical integration of computational pathology technologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Zhang, Ziyang Zhang, Mengnan He, Jiancheng Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation is essential for effective treatment planning and disease monitoring. Existing medical image segmentation methods predominantly rely on uni-modal visual inputs, such as images or videos, requiring labor-intensive manual annotations. Additionally, medical imaging techniques capture multiple intertwined organs within a single scan, further complicating segmentation accuracy. To address these challenges, MedSAM, a large-scale medical segmentation model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), was developed to enhance segmentation accuracy by integrating image features with user-provided prompts. While MedSAM has demonstrated strong performance across various medical segmentation tasks, it primarily relies on geometric prompts (e.g., points and bounding boxes) and lacks support for text-based prompts, which could help specify subtle or ambiguous anatomical structures. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Organ-aware Multi-scale Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation Model (OMT-SAM) for multi-organ segmentation. Our approach introduces CLIP encoders as a novel image-text prompt encoder, operating with the geometric prompt encoder to provide informative contextual guidance. We pair descriptive textual prompts with corresponding images, processing them through pre-trained CLIP encoders and a cross-attention mechanism to generate fused image-text embeddings. Additionally, we extract multi-scale visual features from MedSAM, capturing fine-grained anatomical details at different levels of granularity. We evaluate OMT-SAM on the FLARE 2021 dataset, benchmarking its performance against existing segmentation methods. Empirical results demonstrate that OMT-SAM achieves a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.937, outperforming MedSAM (0.893) and other segmentation models, highlighting its superior capability in handling complex medical image segmentation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deliberation is essential to well-functioning democracies, yet physical, economic, and social barriers often exclude certain groups, reducing representativeness and contributing to issues like group polarization. In this work, we explore the use of large language model (LLM) personas to introduce missing perspectives in policy deliberations. We develop and evaluate a tool that transcribes conversations in real-time and simulates input from relevant but absent stakeholders. We deploy this tool in a 19-person student citizens' assembly on campus sustainability. Participants and facilitators found that the tool sparked new discussions and surfaced valuable perspectives they had not previously considered. However, they also noted that AI-generated responses were sometimes overly general. They raised concerns about overreliance on AI for perspective-taking. Our findings highlight both the promise and potential risks of using LLMs to raise missing points of view in group deliberation settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhyeon Hong, Chaelin Kim, Serin Yoon, Junghyun Nam, Sihun Cha, Junyong Noh</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has advanced significantly with the rise of denoising diffusion models. However, previous methods often oversimplify representations for the skeletal joints, temporal frames, and textual words, limiting their ability to fully capture the information within each modality and their interactions. Moreover, when using pre-trained models for downstream tasks, such as editing, they typically require additional efforts, including manual interventions, optimization, or fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a skeleton-aware latent diffusion (SALAD), a model that explicitly captures the intricate inter-relationships between joints, frames, and words. Furthermore, by leveraging cross-attention maps produced during the generation process, we enable attention-based zero-shot text-driven motion editing using a pre-trained SALAD model, requiring no additional user input beyond text prompts. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of text-motion alignment without compromising generation quality, and demonstrates practical versatility by providing diverse editing capabilities beyond generation.

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning control algorithms face significant challenges due to out-of-distribution and inefficient exploration problems. While model-based reinforcement learning enhances the agent's reasoning and planning capabilities by constructing virtual environments, training such virtual environments can be very complex. In order to build an efficient inference model and enhance the representativeness of learning data, we propose the Counterfactual Experience Augmentation (CEA) algorithm. CEA leverages variational autoencoders to model the dynamic patterns of state transitions and introduces randomness to model non-stationarity. This approach focuses on expanding the learning data in the experience pool through counterfactual inference and performs exceptionally well in environments that follow the bisimulation assumption. Environments with bisimulation properties are usually represented by discrete observation and action spaces, we propose a sampling method based on maximum kernel density estimation entropy to extend CEA to various environments. By providing reward signals for counterfactual state transitions based on real information, CEA constructs a complete counterfactual experience to alleviate the out-of-distribution problem of the learning data, and outperforms general SOTA algorithms in environments with difference properties. Finally, we discuss the similarities, differences and properties of generated counterfactual experiences and real experiences. The code is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/CEA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal systems have highly complex processing pipelines and are pretrained over large datasets before being fine-tuned for specific tasks such as visual captioning. However, it becomes hard to disentangle what the model learns during the fine-tuning process from what it already knows due to its pretraining. In this work, we learn a probabilistic model using Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) over the training examples by relating symbolic knowledge (extracted from the caption) with visual features (extracted from the image). For a generated caption, we quantify the influence of training examples based on the HMLN distribution using probabilistic inference. We evaluate two types of inference procedures on the MSCOCO dataset for different types of captioning models. Our results show that for BLIP2 (a model that uses a LLM), the fine-tuning may have smaller influence on the knowledge the model has acquired since it may have more general knowledge to perform visual captioning as compared to models that do not use a LLM</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately understanding and deciding high-level meta-actions is essential for ensuring reliable and safe autonomous driving systems. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential in various autonomous driving tasks, they often suffer from limitations such as inadequate spatial perception and hallucination, reducing their effectiveness in complex autonomous driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented decision-making (RAD) framework, a novel architecture designed to enhance VLMs' capabilities to reliably generate meta-actions in autonomous driving scenes. RAD leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically improve decision accuracy through a three-stage process consisting of the embedding flow, retrieving flow, and generating flow. Additionally, we fine-tune VLMs on a specifically curated dataset derived from the NuScenes dataset to enhance their spatial perception and bird's-eye view image comprehension capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations on the curated NuScenes-based dataset demonstrate that RAD outperforms baseline methods across key evaluation metrics, including match accuracy, and F1 score, and self-defined overall score, highlighting its effectiveness in improving meta-action decision-making for autonomous driving tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: While human cognition inherently retrieves information from diverse and specialized knowledge sources during decision-making processes, current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically operate through single-source knowledge retrieval, leading to a cognitive-algorithmic discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Qi, Xiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video object detection has made significant progress in recent years thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Typically, CNNs excel at capturing local features but struggle to model global representations. Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global features but face challenges in representing local feature details. Off-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to conduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously leverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection performance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical improvements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph convolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we develop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual information, constituting global representations with long-range feature dependencies. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal GraphFormer module that utilizes local spatial and temporal relationships to aggregate features, generating new local representations that are complementary to the transformer outputs. Third, we design a global-local feature blender module to adaptively couple transformer-based global representations and GraphFormer-based local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGBFormer establishes new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset. Particularly, our TGBFormer achieves 86.5% mAP while running at around 41.0 FPS on a single Tesla A100 GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Qiu, Shuyan Bai, Tingfa Xu, Peifu Liu, Haolin Qin, Jianan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Salient Object Detection (SOD) is crucial in computer vision, yet RGB-based methods face limitations in challenging scenes, such as small objects and similar color features. Hyperspectral images provide a promising solution for more accurate Hyperspectral Salient Object Detection (HSOD) by abundant spectral information, while HSOD methods are hindered by the lack of extensive and available datasets. In this context, we introduce HSOD-BIT-V2, the largest and most challenging HSOD benchmark dataset to date. Five distinct challenges focusing on small objects and foreground-background similarity are designed to emphasize spectral advantages and real-world complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hyper-HRNet, a high-resolution HSOD network. Hyper-HRNet effectively extracts, integrates, and preserves effective spectral information while reducing dimensionality by capturing the self-similar spectral features. Additionally, it conveys fine details and precisely locates object contours by incorporating comprehensive global information and detailed object saliency representations. Experimental analysis demonstrates that Hyper-HRNet outperforms existing models, especially in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eshan Mehendale, Abhinav Thorat, Ravi Kolla, Niranjan Pedanekar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce KANITE, a framework leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation under multiple treatments setting in causal inference. By utilizing KAN's unique abilities to learn univariate activation functions as opposed to learning linear weights by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we improve the estimates of ITEs. The KANITE framework comprises two key architectures: 1.Integral Probability Metric (IPM) architecture: This employs an IPM loss in a specialized manner to effectively align towards ITE estimation across multiple treatments. 2. Entropy Balancing (EB) architecture: This uses weights for samples that are learned by optimizing entropy subject to balancing the covariates across treatment groups. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KANITE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both $\epsilon_{\text{PEHE}}$ and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ metrics. Our experiments highlight the advantages of KANITE in achieving improved causal estimates, emphasizing the potential of KANs to advance causal inference methodologies across diverse application areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkwan Lee, Kyomin Hwang, Nojun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG), where the distributions of train and test data differ, and only a small amount of labeled data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data are available during training. Existing SSDG methods that leverage only the unlabeled samples for which the model's predictions are highly confident (confident-unlabeled samples), limit the full utilization of the available unlabeled data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore a method for incorporating the unconfident-unlabeled samples that were previously disregarded in SSDG setting. To this end, we propose UPCSC to utilize these unconfident-unlabeled samples in SSDG that consists of two modules: 1) Unlabeled Proxy-based Contrastive learning (UPC) module, treating unconfident-unlabeled samples as additional negative pairs and 2) Surrogate Class learning (SC) module, generating positive pairs for unconfident-unlabeled samples using their confusing class set. These modules are plug-and-play and do not require any domain labels, which can be easily integrated into existing approaches. Experiments on four widely used SSDG benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance when attached to baselines and outperforms competing plug-and-play methods. We also analyze the role of our method in SSDG, showing that it enhances class-level discriminability and mitigates domain gaps. The code is available at https://github.com/dongkwani/UPCSC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomohiro Motoda, Ryo Hanai, Ryoichi Nakajo, Masaki Murooka, Floris Erich, Yukiyasu Domae</p>
<p>Abstract: Robots that can operate autonomously in a human living environment are necessary to have the ability to handle various tasks flexibly. One crucial element is coordinated bimanual movements that enable functions that are difficult to perform with one hand alone. In recent years, learning-based models that focus on the possibilities of bimanual movements have been proposed. However, the high degree of freedom of the robot makes it challenging to reason about control, and the left and right robot arms need to adjust their actions depending on the situation, making it difficult to realize more dexterous tasks. To address the issue, we focus on coordination and efficiency between both arms, particularly for synchronized actions. Therefore, we propose a novel imitation learning architecture that predicts cooperative actions. We differentiate the architecture for both arms and add an intermediate encoder layer, Inter-Arm Coordinated transformer Encoder (IACE), that facilitates synchronization and temporal alignment to ensure smooth and coordinated actions. To verify the effectiveness of our architectures, we perform distinctive bimanual tasks. The experimental results showed that our model demonstrated a high success rate for comparison and suggested a suitable architecture for the policy learning of bimanual manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Missing data often exists in real-world datasets, requiring significant time and effort for imputation to learn accurate machine learning (ML) models. In this paper, we demonstrate that imputing all missing values is not always necessary to achieve an accurate ML model. We introduce the concept of minimal data imputation, which ensures accurate ML models trained over the imputed dataset. Implementing minimal imputation guarantees both minimal imputation effort and optimal ML models. We propose algorithms to find exact and approximate minimal imputation for various ML models. Our extensive experiments indicate that our proposed algorithms significantly reduce the time and effort required for data imputation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Karev, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been one of the most important discoveries in machine learning in recent years. LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, such as ChatGPT, have consistently attracted the attention from researchers, investors, and the general public, driving the rapid growth of this industry. With the frequent introduction of new LLMs to the market, it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between them, creating a demand for new LLM comparison methods.
  In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework (ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed. It compares texts generated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall degree of similarity between their responses. The main advantage of this framework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as chatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose any information about their product.
  To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying similarities between multiple LLMs are conducted. Additionally, these experiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by ConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking techniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot LLM comparison scenario.
  The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of multiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component analysis (PCA). The ConSCompF output may provide useful insights into data that might have been used during LLM training and help detect possible investment fraud attempts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic environments with pedestrian traffic is a key challenge in the development of autonomous mobile service robots. Recently, deep reinforcement learning-based methods have been actively studied and have outperformed traditional rule-based approaches owing to their optimization capabilities. Among these, methods that assume a continuous action space typically rely on a Gaussian distribution assumption, which limits the flexibility of generated actions. Meanwhile, the application of diffusion models to reinforcement learning has advanced, allowing for more flexible action distributions compared with Gaussian distribution-based approaches. In this study, we applied a diffusion-based reinforcement learning approach to social navigation and validated its effectiveness. Furthermore, by leveraging the characteristics of diffusion models, we propose an extension that enables post-training action smoothing and adaptation to static obstacle scenarios not considered during the training steps.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traffic scene understanding is essential for intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient vehicle operation. While recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise for holistic scene understanding, the application of VLMs to traffic scenarios, particularly using BEV maps, remains under explored. Existing methods often suffer from limited task design and narrow data amount, hindering comprehensive scene understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatBEV-QA, a novel BEV VQA benchmark contains over 137k questions, designed to encompass a wide range of scene understanding tasks, including global scene understanding, vehicle-lane interactions, and vehicle-vehicle interactions. This benchmark is constructed using an novel data collection pipeline that generates scalable and informative VQA data for BEV maps. We further fine-tune a specialized vision-language model ChatBEV, enabling it to interpret diverse question prompts and extract relevant context-aware information from BEV maps. Additionally, we propose a language-driven traffic scene generation pipeline, where ChatBEV facilitates map understanding and text-aligned navigation guidance, significantly enhancing the generation of realistic and consistent traffic scenarios. The dataset, code and the fine-tuned model will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lili Yang, Mengshuai Chang, Xiao Guo, Yuxin Feng, Yiwen Mei, Caicong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the issues of the existing frustum-based methods' underutilization of image information in road three-dimensional object detection as well as the lack of research on agricultural scenes, we constructed an object detection dataset using an 80-line Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and a camera in a complex tractor road scene and proposed a new network called FrustumFusionNets (FFNets). Initially, we utilize the results of image-based two-dimensional object detection to narrow down the search region in the three-dimensional space of the point cloud. Next, we introduce a Gaussian mask to enhance the point cloud information. Then, we extract the features from the frustum point cloud and the crop image using the point cloud feature extraction pipeline and the image feature extraction pipeline, respectively. Finally, we concatenate and fuse the data features from both modalities to achieve three-dimensional object detection. Experiments demonstrate that on the constructed test set of tractor road data, the FrustumFusionNetv2 achieves 82.28% and 95.68% accuracy in the three-dimensional object detection of the two main road objects, cars and people, respectively. This performance is 1.83% and 2.33% better than the original model. It offers a hybrid fusion-based multi-object, high-precision, real-time three-dimensional object detection technique for unmanned agricultural machines in tractor road scenarios. On the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) Benchmark Suite validation set, the FrustumFusionNetv2 also demonstrates significant superiority in detecting road pedestrian objects compared with other frustum-based three-dimensional object detection methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing effective visual inspection models remains challenging due to the scarcity of defect data. While image generation models have been used to synthesize defect images, producing highly realistic defects remains difficult.

Additionally, our Low-Fidelity Selection method further enhances the defect sample quality. Experiments show that DefectFill generates high-quality defect images, enabling visual inspection models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec AD dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mykyta Syromiatnikov, Victoria Ruvinskaya, Nataliia Komleva</p>
<p>Abstract: Leading large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning-intensive tasks, such as standardized educational testing. However, they often require extensive training in low-resource settings with inaccessible infrastructure. Small or compact models, though more efficient, frequently lack sufficient support for underrepresented languages, leaving a performance gap in critical domains. This work explores the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning of compact open-weight language models to handle reasoning-intensive tasks in the underrepresented Ukrainian language, building on the findings of the ZNO-Eval benchmark. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLaMA 3.1 (8 billion parameters), LLaMA 3.2 (3 billion parameters), and Gemma 2 (9 billion parameters) models on chain-of-thought solutions resulted in a modest test score improvement of up to 17.4% on complex matching tasks and 1.6% overall compared to tuning on answer letters alone, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness. In addition, the proposed tuning method with joint task topic and step-by-step solution generation outperforms standard chain-of-thought tuning in matching tasks and provides a 5.4% gain over the best LLaMA 3.2 model due to guiding the model to recall and apply domain-relevant information. Contrasting obtained results with zero-shot evaluations of leading open-weight and proprietary models such as Qwen, DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o1 and o3, Gemini, and Claude, highlight that fine-tuning LLaMA and Gemma models with 2,032 step-by-step solutions and 20 to 50 million trainable parameters on a single A100 GPU lets them outperform GPT-4o mini, Mistral Large, and larger open-weight models. This research also evaluates how merging the quantized adapter with the base model influences the generation quality.

<p>Abstract: Texture recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. Recent progress leverages feature aggregation into discriminative descriptions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, modeling non-local context relations through visual primitives remains challenging due to the variability and randomness of texture primitives in spatial distributions. In this paper, we propose a graph-enhanced texture encoding network (GraphTEN) designed to capture both local and global features of texture primitives. GraphTEN models global associations through fully connected graphs and captures cross-scale dependencies of texture primitives via bipartite graphs. Additionally, we introduce a patch encoding module that utilizes a codebook to achieve an orderless representation of texture by encoding multi-scale patch features into a unified feature space. The proposed GraphTEN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five publicly available datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The BI_RADS score is a probabilistic reporting tool used by radiologists to express the level of uncertainty in predicting breast cancer based on some morphological features in mammography images. There is a significant variability in describing masses which sometimes leads to BI_RADS misclassification. Using a BI_RADS prediction system is required to support the final radiologist decisions. In this study, the uncertainty information extracted by a Bayesian deep learning model is utilized to predict the BI_RADS score. The investigation results based on the pathology information demonstrate that the f1-scores of the predictions of the radiologist are 42.86%, 48.33% and 48.28%, meanwhile, the f1-scores of the model performance are 73.33%, 59.60% and 59.26% in the BI_RADS 2, 3 and 5 dataset samples, respectively. Also, the model can distinguish malignant from benign samples in the BI_RADS 0 category of the used dataset with an accuracy of 75.86% and correctly identify all malignant samples as BI_RADS 5. The Grad-CAM visualization shows the model pays attention to the morphological features of the lesions. Therefore, this study shows the uncertainty-aware Bayesian Deep Learning model can report his uncertainty about the malignancy of a lesion based on morphological features, like a radiologist.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models have recently made remarkable progress in the field of 3D objects. However, their practical application in fields like engineering remains limited since they fail to deliver the accuracy, quality, and controllability needed for domain-specific tasks. Fine-tuning large generative models is a promising perspective for making these models available in these fields. Creating high-quality, domain-specific 3D datasets is crucial for fine-tuning large generative models, yet the data filtering and annotation process remains a significant bottleneck. We present MeshFleet, a filtered and annotated 3D vehicle dataset extracted from Objaverse-XL, the most extensive publicly available collection of 3D objects. Our approach proposes a pipeline for automated data filtering based on a quality classifier. This classifier is trained on a manually labeled subset of Objaverse, incorporating DINOv2 and SigLIP embeddings, refined through caption-based analysis and uncertainty estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our filtering method through a comparative analysis against caption and image aesthetic score-based techniques and fine-tuning experiments with SV3D, highlighting the importance of targeted data selection for domain-specific 3D generative modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning is of great significance in medical image segmentation by exploiting unlabeled data. Among its strategies, the co-training framework is prominent. However, previous co-training studies predominantly concentrate on network initialization variances and pseudo-label generation, while overlooking the equilibrium between information interchange and model diversity preservation. In this paper, we propose the Masked Image Consistency and Discrepancy Learning (MICD) framework with three key modules. The Masked Cross Pseudo Consistency (MCPC) module enriches context perception and small sample learning via pseudo-labeling across masked-input branches. The Cross Feature Consistency (CFC) module fortifies information exchange and model robustness by ensuring decoder feature consistency. The Cross Model Discrepancy (CMD) module utilizes EMA teacher networks to oversee outputs and preserve branch diversity. Together, these modules address existing limitations by focusing on fine-grained local information and maintaining diversity in a heterogeneous framework. Experiments on two public medical image datasets, AMOS and Synapse, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) has become integral to modern society, making it crucial to be understood for human-centric systems. However, unlike natural images or documents, GUIs comprise artificially designed graphical elements arranged to convey specific semantic meanings. Current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) already proficient in processing graphical and textual components suffer from hurdles in GUI understanding due to the lack of explicit spatial structure modeling. Moreover, obtaining high-quality spatial structure data is challenging due to privacy issues and noisy environments. To address these challenges, we present MP-GUI, a specially designed MLLM for GUI understanding. MP-GUI features three precisely specialized perceivers to extract graphical, textual, and spatial modalities from the screen as GUI-tailored visual clues, with spatial structure refinement strategy and adaptively combined via a fusion gate to meet the specific preferences of different GUI understanding tasks. To cope with the scarcity of training data, we also introduce a pipeline for automatically data collecting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MP-GUI achieves impressive results on various GUI understanding tasks with limited data.</p>

Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate traffic flow estimation and prediction are critical for the efficient management of transportation systems, particularly under increasing urbanization. Traditional methods relying on static sensors often suffer from limited spatial coverage, while probe vehicles provide richer, albeit sparse and irregular data.

Our framework is evaluated in both numerical and simulation datasets, showcasing its ability to handle irregular, sparse input data, adapt to time-shifted scenarios, and provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. The results demonstrate that the model captures complex traffic phenomena, including shockwaves and congestion propagation, while maintaining robustness to noise and sensor dropout.

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in video generation, but their sequential token-by-token decoding process poses a major bottleneck, particularly for long videos represented by tens of thousands of tokens. In this paper, we propose Diagonal Decoding (DiagD), a training-free inference acceleration algorithm for autoregressively pre-trained models that exploits spatial and temporal correlations in videos. Our method generates tokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling parallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across consecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various generative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the trade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a cost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the model with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on small-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation models and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\times$ speedup compared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual fidelity.</p>

These non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods, including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and $\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows:
  $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT).
  $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation.
  $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Chen-Yu Liu, Kin K. Leung</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce a Distributed Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) framework that leverages modular quantum computing to address scalability challenges on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. By embedding variational quantum circuits into LSTM cells, the QLSTM captures long-range temporal dependencies, while a distributed architecture partitions the underlying Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into smaller, manageable subcircuits that can be executed on a network of quantum processing units. We assess the proposed framework using nontrivial benchmark problems such as damped harmonic oscillators and Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average sequences. Our results demonstrate that the distributed QLSTM achieves stable convergence and improved training dynamics compared to classical approaches. This work underscores the potential of modular, distributed quantum computing architectures for large-scale sequence modelling, providing a foundation for the future integration of hybrid quantum-classical solutions into advanced Quantum High-performance computing (HPC) ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Abdalla, Elia Gatti, Mine Orlu, Marianna Obrist</p>
<p>Abstract: The five senses are gateways to our wellbeing and their decline is considered a significant public health challenge which is linked to multiple conditions that contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Modern technology, with its ubiquitous nature and fast data processing has the ability to leverage the power of the senses to transform our approach to day to day healthcare, with positive effects on our quality of life. Here, we introduce the idea of sensory-driven microinterventions for preventative, personalised healthcare. Microinterventions are targeted, timely, minimally invasive strategies that seamlessly integrate into our daily life. This idea harnesses human's sensory capabilities, leverages technological advances in sensory stimulation and real-time processing ability for sensing the senses. The collection of sensory data from our continuous interaction with technology - for example the tone of voice, gait movement, smart home behaviour - opens up a shift towards personalised technology-enabled, sensory-focused healthcare interventions, coupled with the potential of early detection and timely treatment of sensory deficits that can signal critical health insights, especially for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jef Jonkers, Frank Coopman, Luc Duchateau, Glenn Van Wallendael, Sofie Van Hoecke</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic anatomical landmark localization in medical imaging requires not just accurate predictions but reliable uncertainty quantification for effective clinical decision support. Current uncertainty quantification approaches often fall short, particularly when combined with normality assumptions, systematically underestimating total predictive uncertainty. This paper introduces conformal prediction as a framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in anatomical landmark localization, addressing a critical gap in automatic landmark localization. We present two novel approaches guaranteeing finite-sample validity for multi-output prediction: Multi-output Regression-as-Classification Conformal Prediction (M-R2CCP) and its variant Multi-output Regression to Classification Conformal Prediction set to Region (M-R2C2R). Unlike conventional methods that produce axis-aligned hyperrectangular or ellipsoidal regions, our approaches generate flexible, non-convex prediction regions that better capture the underlying uncertainty structure of landmark predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation across multiple 2D and 3D datasets, we demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing multi-output conformal prediction approaches in both validity and efficiency. This work represents a significant advancement in reliable uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark localization, providing clinicians with trustworthy confidence measures for their diagnoses. While developed for medical imaging, these methods show promise for broader applications in multi-output regression problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Gonthier</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid evolution of territories due to climate change and human impact requires prompt and effective updates to geospatial databases maintained by the National Mapping Agency. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of change detection methods tailored for the operational updating of large-scale geographic databases. This review first outlines the fundamental definition of change, emphasizing its multifaceted nature, from temporal to semantic characterization. It categorizes automatic change detection methods into four main families: rule-based, statistical, machine learning, and simulation methods. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of every family are discussed in the context of various input data. Then, key applications for National Mapping Agencies are identified, particularly the optimization of geospatial database updating, change-based phenomena, and dynamics monitoring. Finally, the paper highlights the current challenges for leveraging change detection such as the variability of change definition, the missing of relevant large-scale datasets, the diversity of input data, the unstudied no-change detection, the human in the loop integration and the operational constraints. The discussion underscores the necessity for ongoing innovation in change detection techniques to address the future needs of geographic information systems for national mapping agencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Defa Zhu, Hongzhi Huang, Jundong Zhou, Zihao Huang, Yutao Zeng, Banggu Wu, Qiyang Min, Xun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual connections are central to modern deep learning architectures, enabling the training of very deep networks by mitigating gradient vanishing. Hyper-Connections recently generalized residual connections by introducing multiple connection strengths at different depths, thereby addressing the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse. However, Hyper-Connections increase memory access costs by expanding the width of hidden states. In this paper, we propose Frac-Connections, a novel approach that divides hidden states into multiple parts rather than expanding their width. Frac-Connections retain partial benefits of Hyper-Connections while reducing memory consumption. To validate their effectiveness, we conduct large-scale experiments on language tasks, with the largest being a 7B MoE model trained on up to 3T tokens, demonstrating that Frac-Connections significantly outperform residual connections.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language models have demonstrated excellent domain-specific question-answering capabilities when finetuned with a particular dataset of that specific domain. However, fine-tuning the models requires a significant amount of training time and a considerable amount of hardware. In this work, we propose CARE (Customer Assistance and Response Engine), a lightweight model made by fine-tuning Phi3.5-mini on very minimal hardware and data, designed to handle queries primarily across three domains: telecommunications support, medical support, and banking support. For telecommunications and banking, the chatbot addresses issues and problems faced by customers regularly in the above-mentioned domains. In the medical domain, CARE provides preliminary support by offering basic diagnoses and medical suggestions that a user might take before consulting a healthcare professional. Since CARE is built on Phi3.5-mini, it can be used even on mobile devices, increasing its usability. Our research also shows that CARE performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth D Jaiswal, Sagnik Basu, Sandipan Sikdar, Animesh Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated Face Recognition Systems (FRSs), developed using deep learning models, are deployed worldwide for identity verification and facial attribute analysis. The performance of these models is determined by a complex interdependence among the model architecture, optimization/loss function and datasets. Although FRSs have surpassed human-level accuracy, they continue to be disparate against certain demographics. Due to the ubiquity of applications, it is extremely important to understand the impact of the three components -- model architecture, loss function and face image dataset on the accuracy-disparity trade-off to design better, unbiased platforms. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of three FRSs for the task of gender prediction, with various architectural modifications resulting in ten deep-learning models coupled with four loss functions and benchmark them on seven face datasets across 266 evaluation configurations. Our results show that all three components have an individual as well as a combined impact on both accuracy and disparity. We identify that datasets have an inherent property that causes them to perform similarly across models, independent of the choice of loss functions. Moreover, the choice of dataset determines the model's perceived bias -- the same model reports bias in opposite directions for three gender-balanced datasets of ``in-the-wild'' face images of popular individuals. Studying the facial embeddings shows that the models are unable to generalize a uniform definition of what constitutes a ``female face'' as opposed to a ``male face'', due to dataset diversity. We provide recommendations to model developers on using our study as a blueprint for model development and subsequent deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Concat-ID, a unified framework for identity-preserving video generation. Concat-ID employs Variational Autoencoders to extract image features, which are concatenated with video latents along the sequence dimension, leveraging solely 3D self-attention mechanisms without the need for additional modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation. Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis, providing a versatile and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although formal methods are capable of producing reliable software, they have seen minimal adoption in everyday programming. Automatic code generation using large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages (Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atharva Ghotavadekar, Franti\v{s}ek Nekov\'a\v{r}, Martin Saska, Jan Faigl</p>
<p>Abstract: Agile trajectory planning can improve the efficiency of multi-rotor Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in scenarios with combined task-oriented and kinematic trajectory planning, such as monitoring spatio-temporal phenomena or intercepting dynamic targets. Agile planning using existing non-linear model predictive control methods is limited by the number of planning steps as it becomes increasingly computationally demanding. That reduces the prediction horizon length, leading to a decrease in solution quality. Besides, the fixed time-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the target neighborhood. In this paper, we propose to address these limitations by introducing variable time steps and coupling them with the prediction horizon length. A simplified point-mass motion primitive is used to leverage the differential flatness of quadrotor dynamics and the generation of feasible trajectories in the flat output space. Based on the presented evaluation results and experimentally validated deployment, the proposed method increases the solution quality by enabling planning for long flight segments but allowing tightly sampled maneuvering.</p>

Within the JENA communities-ECFA, NuPECC, and APPEC-and as part of the EuCAIF initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and development (R&D) to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap, informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical infrastructure requirements, prioritizes training initiatives, and proposes funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the next five years.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ma, Zhiqiang Pu, Shijie Wang, Boyin Liu, Huimu Wang, Yanyan Liang, Jianqiang Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction facilitates effective planning and decision-making, while constrained trajectory prediction integrates regulation into prediction. Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nobuhiko Wakai, Satoshi Sato, Yasunori Ishii, Takayoshi Yamashita</p>
<p>Abstract: Person detection methods are used widely in applications including visual surveillance, pedestrian detection, and robotics. However, accurate detection of persons from overhead fisheye images remains an open challenge because of factors including person rotation and small-sized persons. To address the person rotation problem, we convert the fisheye images into panoramic images. For smaller people, we focused on the geometry of the panoramas. Conventional detection methods tend to focus on larger people because these larger people yield large significant areas for feature maps. In equirectangular panoramic images, we find that a person's height decreases linearly near the top of the images. Using this finding, we leverage the significance values and aggregate tokens that are sorted based on these values to balance the significant areas. In this leveraging process, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware tokenization. This tokenization procedure divides a panoramic image using self-similarity figures that enable determination of optimal divisions without gaps, and we leverage the maximum significant values in each tile of token groups to preserve the significant areas of smaller people. To achieve higher detection accuracy, we propose a person detection and localization method that combines panoramic-image remapping and the tokenization procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms conventional methods when applied to large-scale datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image diffusion models can produce undesirable content that necessitates concept erasure techniques. However, existing methods struggle with under-erasure, leaving residual traces of targeted concepts, or over-erasure, mistakenly eliminating unrelated but visually similar concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce CRCE, a novel concept erasure framework that leverages Large Language Models to identify both semantically related concepts that should be erased alongside the target and distinct concepts that should be preserved. By explicitly modeling coreferential and retained concepts semantically, CRCE enables more precise concept removal, without unintended erasure. Experiments demonstrate that CRCE outperforms existing methods on diverse erasure tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging the training-by-pruning paradigm introduced by Zhou et al. and Isik et al. introduced a federated learning protocol that achieves a 34-fold reduction in communication cost. We achieve a compression improvements of orders of orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art. The central idea of our framework is to encode the network weights $\vec w$ by a the vector of trainable parameters $\vec p$, such that $\vec w = Q\cdot \vec p$ where $Q$ is a carefully-generate sparse random matrix (that remains fixed throughout training). In such framework, the previous work of Zhou et al. [NeurIPS'19] is retrieved when $Q$ is diagonal and $\vec p$ has the same dimension of $\vec w$. We instead show that $\vec p$ can effectively be chosen much smaller than $\vec w$, while retaining the same accuracy at the price of a decrease of the sparsity of $Q$. Since server and clients only need to share $\vec p$, such a trade-off leads to a substantial improvement in communication cost. Moreover, we provide theoretical insight into our framework and establish a novel link between training-by-sampling and random convex geometry.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlow-SLAM, a robust and effective Tightly-Coupled RGBD-inertial SLAM for legged robots operating in highly dynamic environments.By integrating geometric consistency, legged odometry constraints, and dual-stream optical flow (GeoFlow), our method addresses three critical challenges:feature matching and pose initialization failures during fast locomotion and visual feature scarcity in texture-less scenes.Specifically, in rapid motion scenarios, feature matching is notably enhanced by leveraging dual-stream optical flow, which combines prior map points and poses. Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Yang, Shengben Bi, Yihui Xu, Xin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing demand for efficient and flexible robotic exploration solutions, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a promising approach in the field of autonomous robotic exploration. However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces JuDGE (Judgment Document Generation Evaluation), a novel benchmark for evaluating the performance of judgment document generation in the Chinese legal system. We define the task as generating a complete legal judgment document from the given factual description of the case. To facilitate this benchmark, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of factual descriptions from real legal cases, paired with their corresponding full judgment documents, which serve as the ground truth for evaluating the quality of generated documents. This dataset is further augmented by two external legal corpora that provide additional legal knowledge for the task: one comprising statutes and regulations, and the other consisting of a large collection of past judgment documents. In collaboration with legal professionals, we establish a comprehensive automated evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across various dimensions. We evaluate various baseline approaches, including few-shot in-context learning, fine-tuning, and a multi-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, using both general and legal-domain LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that, while RAG approaches can effectively improve performance in this task, there is still substantial room for further improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew J. Allen, Harry J. F. Owen, Stuart W. D. Grieve, Emily R. Lines</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring forest dynamics at an individual tree scale is essential for accurately assessing ecosystem responses to climate change, yet traditional methods relying on field-based forest inventories are labor-intensive and limited in spatial coverage. Advances in remote sensing using drone-acquired RGB imagery combined with deep learning models have promised precise individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation; however, existing methods are frequently validated against human-annotated images, lacking rigorous independent ground truth. In this study, we generate high-fidelity validation labels from co-located Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data for drone imagery of mixed unmanaged boreal and Mediterranean forests. We evaluate the performance of two widely used deep learning ITC segmentation models - DeepForest (RetinaNet) and Detectree2 (Mask R-CNN) - on these data, and compare to performance on further Mediterranean forest data labelled manually. When validated against TLS-derived ground truth from Mediterranean forests, model performance decreased significantly compared to assessment based on hand-labelled from an ecologically similar site (AP50: 0.094 vs. 0.670). Restricting evaluation to only canopy trees shrank this gap considerably (Canopy AP50: 0.365), although performance was still far lower than on similar hand-labelled data. Models also performed poorly on boreal forest data (AP50: 0.142), although again increasing when evaluated on canopy trees only (Canopy AP50: 0.308). Both models showed very poor localisation accuracy at stricter IoU thresholds, even when restricted to canopy trees (Max AP75: 0.051). Similar results have been observed in studies using aerial LiDAR data, suggesting fundamental limitations in aerial-based segmentation approaches in closed canopy forests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakib Matin, Emily Shinkle, Yulia Pimonova, Galen T. Craven, Ying Wai Li, Kipton Barros, Nicholas Lubbers</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising tool to accelerate atomistic simulations and molecular property prediction. The quality of MLIPs strongly depends on the quantity of available training data as well as the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used to generate that data. Datasets generated with high-fidelity QC methods, such as coupled cluster, are typically restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients. With this limited quantity of data, it is often difficult to train good MLIP models. We present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. In our EKD approach, first, multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then used to generate atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, a student MLIP is trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset which consists of organic molecules with configuration energies computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on the out-of-sample COMP6 benchmark and improved stability for molecular dynamics simulations. The EKD approach for MLIP is broadly applicable for chemical, biomolecular and materials science simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baiqin Wang, Xiangyu Zhu, Fan Shen, Hao Xu, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-driven talking face generation have made great progress in lip synchronization. However, current methods often lack sufficient control over facial animation such as speaking style and emotional expression, resulting in uniform outputs. In this paper, we focus on improving two key factors: lip-audio alignment and emotion control, to enhance the diversity and user-friendliness of talking videos. Lip-audio alignment control focuses on elements like speaking style and the scale of lip movements, whereas emotion control is centered on generating realistic emotional expressions, allowing for modifications in multiple attributes such as intensity. To achieve precise control of facial animation, we propose a novel framework, PC-Talk, which enables lip-audio alignment and emotion control through implicit keypoint deformations. First, our lip-audio alignment control module facilitates precise editing of speaking styles at the word level and adjusts lip movement scales to simulate varying vocal loudness levels, maintaining lip synchronization with the audio. Second, our emotion control module generates vivid emotional facial features with pure emotional deformation. This module also enables the fine modification of intensity and the combination of multiple emotions across different facial regions. Our method demonstrates outstanding control capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HDTF and MEAD datasets in extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adri\'an Javaloy, Antonio Vergari, Isabel Valera</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning (ML), it is common to account for multiple objectives when, e.g., selecting a model to deploy. However, it is often unclear how one should compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives, as they might be measured in different units or scales. For example, when deploying large language models (LLMs), we might not only care about their performance, but also their CO2 consumption. In this work, we investigate how objectives can be sensibly compared and aggregated to navigate their Pareto front. To do so, we propose to make incomparable objectives comparable via their CDFs, approximated by their relative rankings. This allows us to aggregate them while matching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully navigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the potential impact of our methodology in diverse areas such as LLM selection, domain generalization, and AutoML benchmarking, where classical ways to aggregate and normalize objectives fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojjat Azimi Asrari, Megan A. K. Peters</p>
<p>Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal how neural representations encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as its contents or structure. These are ``first-order" representations (FORs), because they're ``about" the external world. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- their contents, stability, or uncertainty. HORs of uncertainty appear critically involved in adaptive behaviors including learning under uncertainty, influencing learning rates and internal model updating based on environmental feedback. However, HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting estimation processes which may be lossy, bias-prone, or distortive and which may also incorporate estimates of distributions of uncertainty the observer is likely to experience. While some research has targeted neural representations of ``instantaneously" estimated uncertainty, how the brain represents \textit{distributions} of expected uncertainty remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to explore neural representations of uncertainty distributions. We use existing functional magnetic resonance imaging data, where humans learned to `de-noise' their brain states to achieve target neural patterns, to train denoising diffusion genAI models with RL algorithms to learn noise distributions similar to how humans might learn to do the same. We then explore these models' learned noise-distribution HORs compared to control models trained with traditional backpropagation. Results reveal model-dependent differences in noise distribution representations -- with the RL-based model offering much higher explanatory power for human behavior -- offering an exciting path towards using genAI to explore neural noise-distribution HORs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Roxburgh, Floriana Grasso, Terry R. Payne</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqian Ju, Dongchao Yang, Jianwei Yu, Kai Shen, Yichong Leng, Zhengtao Wang, Xu Tan, Xinyu Zhou, Tao Qin, Xiangyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in generating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However, these systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long, multi-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such as podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long speech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of most existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous, oral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing works often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose MoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to synthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories, technical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of unseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language model-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech data. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to generate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to be as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself. Experiments demonstrate that MoonCast outperforms baselines, with particularly notable improvements in spontaneity and coherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoubin Yu, Difan Liu, Ziqiao Ma, Yicong Hong, Yang Zhou, Hao Tan, Joyce Chai, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have enhanced video editing, but it remains challenging to handle instructional editing and diverse tasks (e.g., adding, removing, changing) within a unified framework. In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: A CORDIC-based configuration for the design of Activation Functions (AF) was previously suggested to accelerate ASIC hardware design for resource-constrained systems by providing functional reconfigurability. Since its introduction, this new approach for neural network acceleration has gained widespread popularity, influencing numerous designs for activation functions in both academic and commercial AI processors. In this retrospective analysis, we explore the foundational aspects of this initiative, summarize key developments over recent years, and introduce the DA-VINCI AF tailored for the evolving needs of AI applications. This new generation of dynamically configurable and precision-adjustable activation function cores promise greater adaptability for a range of activation functions in AI workloads, including Swish, SoftMax, SeLU, and GeLU, utilizing the Shift-and-Add CORDIC technique. The previously presented design has been optimized for MAC, Sigmoid, and Tanh functionalities and incorporated into ReLU AFs, culminating in an accumulative NEURIC compute unit. These enhancements position NEURIC as a fundamental component in the resource-efficient vector engine for the realization of AI accelerators that focus on DNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, and Transformers, achieving a quality of results (QoR) of 98.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Beck, Korbinian P\"oppel, Phillip Lippe, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear RNNs with gating recently demonstrated competitive performance compared to Transformers in language modeling. Although their linear compute scaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over Transformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom kernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels. Leveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs, Flash Linear Attention (FLA) shows that linear RNN kernels are faster than Flash Attention, by parallelizing over chunks of the input sequence. However, since the chunk size of FLA is limited, many intermediate states must be materialized in GPU memory. This leads to low arithmetic intensity and causes high memory consumption and IO cost, especially for long-context pre-training. In this work, we present Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm for linear RNNs, that enables arbitrary large chunk sizes by introducing an additional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk. First, we apply TFLA to the xLSTM with matrix memory, the mLSTM. Second, we propose an mLSTM variant with sigmoid input gate and reduced computation for even faster kernel runtimes at equal language modeling performance. In our speed benchmarks, we show that our new mLSTM kernels based on TFLA outperform highly optimized Flash Attention, Linear Attention and Mamba kernels, setting a new state of the art for efficient long-context sequence modeling primitives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Zhang, Yun Xiong, Yateng Tang, Xi Chen, Zian Jia, Zehao Gu, Jiarong Xu, Jiawei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social platforms have expanded opportunities for deliberation with the comments being used to inform one's opinion. However, using such information to form opinions is challenged by unsubstantiated or false content. To enhance the quality of opinion formation and potentially confer resistance to misinformation, we developed Iffy-Or-Not (ION), a browser extension that seeks to invoke critical thinking when reading texts. With three features guided by argumentation theory, ION highlights fallacious content, suggests diverse queries to probe them with, and offers deeper questions to consider and chat with others about. From a user study (N=18), we found that ION encourages users to be more attentive to the content, suggests queries that align with or are preferable to their own, and poses thought-provoking questions that expands their perspectives. However, some participants expressed aversion to ION due to misalignments with their information goals and thinking predispositions. Potential backfiring effects with ION are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ever growing realism and quality of generated videos makes it increasingly harder for humans to spot deepfake content, who need to rely more and more on automatic deepfake detectors. However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts. Our novel dataset and code to reproduce the results are available at https://github.com/vladhondru25/ExDDV.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant strides with diffusion models. However, existing methods still struggle with accurately binding attributes, determining spatial relationships, and capturing complex action interactions between multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we propose MagicComp, a training-free method that enhances compositional T2V generation through dual-phase refinement. Specifically, (1) During the Conditioning Stage: We introduce the Semantic Anchor Disambiguation to reinforces subject-specific semantics and resolve inter-subject ambiguity by progressively injecting the directional vectors of semantic anchors into original text embedding; (2) During the Denoising Stage: We propose Dynamic Layout Fusion Attention, which integrates grounding priors and model-adaptive spatial perception to flexibly bind subjects to their spatiotemporal regions through masked attention modulation. Furthermore, MagicComp is a model-agnostic and versatile approach, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing T2V architectures. Extensive experiments on T2V-CompBench and VBench demonstrate that MagicComp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for applications such as complex prompt-based and trajectory-controllable video generation.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based method for re-synthesis of quantum circuits containing arbitrary Pauli rotations alongside Clifford operations. By collapsing each sub-block to a compact representation and then synthesizing it step-by-step through a learned heuristic, we obtain circuits that are both shorter and compliant with hardware connectivity constraints. We find that the method is fast enough and good enough to work as an optimization procedure: in direct comparisons on 6-qubit random Pauli Networks against state-of-the-art heuristic methods, our RL approach yields over 2x reduction in two-qubit gate count, while executing in under 10 milliseconds per circuit. We further integrate the method into a collect-and-re-synthesize pipeline, applied as a Qiskit transpiler pass, where we observe average improvements of 20% in two-qubit gate count and depth, reaching up to 60% for many instances, across the Benchpress benchmark. These results highlight the potential of RL-driven synthesis to significantly improve circuit quality in realistic, large-scale quantum transpilation workloads.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present RWKV-7 "Goose", a new sequence modeling architecture, along with pre-trained language models that establish a new state-of-the-art in downstream performance at the 3 billion parameter scale on multilingual tasks, and match current SoTA English language performance despite being trained on dramatically fewer tokens than other top 3B models. Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.

In this work, we start an investigation into the alignment of these scores on the basis of the queries at hand; that is, on whether they induce compatible rankings of tuples. We are able to identify vast classes of queries for which some pairs of scores are always aligned, and others for which they are not.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fardin Saad, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah, Munindar P. Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, but their performance is often limited by the uniform processing of inputs across varying conditions and noise levels. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages the inherent heterogeneity of the diffusion process. Our method, DiffMoE, introduces a batch-level global token pool that enables experts to access global token distributions during training, promoting specialized expert behavior. To unleash the full potential of the diffusion process, DiffMoE incorporates a capacity predictor that dynamically allocates computational resources based on noise levels and sample complexity. Through comprehensive evaluation, DiffMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on ImageNet benchmark, substantially outperforming both dense architectures with 3x activated parameters and existing MoE approaches while maintaining 1x activated parameters. The effectiveness of our approach extends beyond class-conditional generation to more challenging tasks such as text-to-image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability across different diffusion model applications.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Cosmos-Transfer, a conditional world generation model that can generate world simulations based on multiple spatial control inputs of various modalities such as segmentation, depth, and edge. In the design, the spatial conditional scheme is adaptive and customizable. It allows weighting different conditional inputs differently at different spatial locations. This enables highly controllable world generation and finds use in various world-to-world transfer use cases, including Sim2Real. We conduct extensive evaluations to analyze the proposed model and demonstrate its applications for Physical AI, including robotics Sim2Real and autonomous vehicle data enrichment. We further demonstrate an inference scaling strategy to achieve real-time world generation with an NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuxin Wang, Wenfei Yang, Xiang Liu, Tianzhu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: DETR-based methods, which use multi-layer transformer decoders to refine object queries iteratively, have shown promising performance in 3D indoor object detection. However, the scene point features in the transformer decoder remain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers, thereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM) have shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through iterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we propose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space model (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM parameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as queries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key designs tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The serialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional feature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and scene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point features and query features with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEST-based method. Our method improves the GroupFree baseline in terms of AP50 on ScanNet V2 (+5.3) and SUN RGB-D (+3.2) datasets. Based on the VDETR baseline, Our method sets a new SOTA on the ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangfu Mei, Hossein Talebi, Mojtaba Ardakani, Vishal M. Patel, Peyman Milanfar, Mauricio Delbracio</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains challenging due to the inherent difficulty of recovering fine-grained details and preserving perceptual quality from low-resolution inputs. Existing methods often rely on limited image priors, leading to suboptimal results. We propose a novel approach that leverages the rich contextual information available in multiple modalities -- including depth, segmentation, edges, and text prompts -- to learn a powerful generative prior for SISR within a diffusion model framework. We introduce a flexible network architecture that effectively fuses multimodal information, accommodating an arbitrary number of input modalities without requiring significant modifications to the diffusion process. Crucially, we mitigate hallucinations, often introduced by text prompts, by using spatial information from other modalities to guide regional text-based conditioning. Each modality's guidance strength can also be controlled independently, allowing steering outputs toward different directions, such as increasing bokeh through depth or adjusting object prominence via segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art generative SISR methods, achieving superior visual quality and fidelity. See project page at https://mmsr.kfmei.com/.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MusicInfuser, an approach for generating high-quality dance videos that are synchronized to a specified music track. Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Jeanselme, Maria De-Arteaga, Zhe Zhang, Jessica Barrett, Brian Tom</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning risks reinforcing biases present in data and, as we argue in this work, in what is absent from data. In healthcare, societal and decision biases shape patterns in missing data, yet the algorithmic fairness implications of group-specific missingness are poorly understood. The way we address missingness in healthcare can have detrimental impacts on downstream algorithmic fairness. Our work questions current recommendations and practices aimed at handling missing data with a focus on their effect on algorithmic fairness, and offers a path forward. Specifically, we consider the theoretical underpinnings of existing recommendations as well as their empirical predictive performance and corresponding algorithmic fairness measured through subgroup performances. Our results show that current practices for handling missingness lack principled foundations, are disconnected from the realities of missingness mechanisms in healthcare, and can be counterproductive. For example, we show that favouring group-specific imputation strategy can be misguided and exacerbate prediction disparities. We then build on our findings to propose a framework for empirically guiding imputation choices, and an accompanying reporting framework. Our work constitutes an important contribution to recent efforts by regulators and practitioners to grapple with the realities of real-world data, and to foster the responsible and transparent deployment of machine learning systems. We demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed framework through experimentation on widely used datasets, where we show how the proposed framework can guide the selection of imputation strategies, allowing us to choose among strategies that yield equal overall predictive performance but present different algorithmic fairness properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Cheng, Peter Chin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Transitional Dictionary Learning (TDL) framework that can implicitly learn symbolic knowledge, such as visual parts and relations, by reconstructing the input as a combination of parts with implicit relations. We propose a game-theoretic diffusion model to decompose the input into visual parts using the dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented as the online prototype clustering, based on the decomposition results. Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features. Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones. Furthermore, the proposed metrics are consistent with human evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lev Telyatnikov, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Guillermo Bernardez, Olga Zaghen, Simone Scardapane, Pietro Lio</p>
<p>Abstract: Most of the current hypergraph learning methodologies and benchmarking datasets in the hypergraph realm are obtained by lifting procedures from their graph analogs, leading to overshadowing specific characteristics of hypergraphs. This paper attempts to confront some pending questions in that regard: Q1 Can the concept of homophily play a crucial role in Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs)? Q2 Is there room for improving current HNN architectures by carefully addressing specific characteristics of higher-order networks? Q3 Do existing datasets provide a meaningful benchmark for HNNs? To address them, we first introduce a novel conceptualization of homophily in higher-order networks based on a Message Passing (MP) scheme, unifying both the analytical examination and the modeling of higher-order networks. Further, we investigate some natural, yet mostly unexplored, strategies for processing higher-order structures within HNNs such as keeping hyperedge-dependent node representations, or performing node/hyperedge stochastic samplings, leading us to the most general MP formulation up to date -MultiSet-, as well as to an original architecture design, MultiSetMixer. Finally, we conduct an extensive set of experiments that contextualize our proposals and successfully provide insights about our inquiries.</p>

<p>Abstract: For combinatorial optimization problems, model-based paradigms such as mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) aim to decouple modeling and solving a problem: the `holy grail' of declarative problem solving. We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven. DIDP also achieves superior performance to existing state-based solvers including domain-independent AI planners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqi Dai, Zebin You, Dong Jing, Yutian Luo, Nanyi Fei, Guoxing Yang, Zhiwu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning is an important training stage for large multimodal models. Nevertheless, when learning multiple visual tasks simultaneously, this approach may lead to suboptimal and imbalanced overall performance due to latent knowledge conflicts across tasks. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel Comprehensive Task Balancing (CoTBal) algorithm tailored for multi-task visual instruction tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multi-task optimization in visual instruction tuning. Specifically, we consider two critical dimensions for task balancing: (1) Inter-Task Contribution, which represents the phenomenon where learning one task could enhance the performance on others owing to the overlapping knowledge domains across tasks, and (2) Intra-Task Difficulty, which indicates the inherent learning difficulty of a single task. Furthermore, by quantifying these with performance-based metrics, comprehensive task balancing is thus achieved by assigning greater weight to tasks that offer substantial contributions to others, receive minimal contributions from others, and present high learning difficulties. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our CoTBal algorithm results in superior and more balanced overall performance in multi-task visual instruction tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rhys Howard, Lars Kunze</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we aim to bridge the divide between autonomous vehicles and causal reasoning. Autonomous vehicles have come to increasingly interact with human drivers, and in many cases may pose risks to the physical or mental well-being of those they interact with. Meanwhile causal models, despite their inherent transparency and ability to offer contrastive explanations, have found limited usage within such systems. As such, we first identify the challenges that have limited the integration of structural causal models within autonomous vehicles. We then introduce a number of theoretical extensions to the structural causal model formalism in order to tackle these challenges. This augments these models to possess greater levels of modularisation and encapsulation, as well presenting temporal causal model representation with constant space complexity. We also prove through the extensions we have introduced that dynamically mutable sets (e.g. varying numbers of autonomous vehicles across time) can be used within a structural causal model while maintaining a relaxed form of causal stationarity. Finally we discuss the application of the extensions in the context of the autonomous vehicle and service robotics domain along with potential directions for future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated human-level proficiency in various benchmarks across domains like programming, natural sciences, and general knowledge. Despite these promising results on competitive benchmarks, they still struggle with seemingly simple problem-solving tasks typically carried out by elementary-level students. How do state-of-the-art models perform on standardized programming-related tests designed to assess computational thinking and problem-solving skills at schools? In this paper, we curate a novel benchmark involving computational thinking tests grounded in elementary visual programming domains. Our initial results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Llama3 barely match the performance of an average school student. To further boost the performance of these models, we fine-tune them using a novel synthetic data generation methodology. The key idea is to develop a comprehensive dataset using symbolic methods that capture different skill levels, ranging from recognition of visual elements to multi-choice quizzes to synthesis-style tasks. We showcase how various aspects of symbolic information in synthetic data help improve fine-tuned models' performance. We will release the full implementation and datasets to facilitate further research on enhancing computational thinking in generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Wojciechowski, Mateusz Lango, Ondrej Dusek</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing explanation methods for image classification struggle to provide faithful and plausible explanations. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a post-hoc natural language explanation method that can be applied to any CNN-based classifier without altering its training process or affecting predictive performance. By analysing influential neurons and the corresponding activation maps, the method generates a faithful description of the classifier's decision process in the form of a structured meaning representation, which is then converted into text by a language model. Through this pipeline approach, the generated explanations are grounded in the neural network architecture, providing accurate insight into the classification process while remaining accessible to non-experts. Experimental results show that the NLEs constructed by our method are significantly more plausible and faithful. In particular, user interventions in the neural network structure (masking of neurons) are three times more effective than the baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data missingness is a practical challenge of sustained interest to the scientific community. In this paper, we present Shades-of-Null, an evaluation suite for responsible missing value imputation. Our work is novel in two ways (i) we model realistic and socially-salient missingness scenarios that go beyond Rubin's classic Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) settings, to include multi-mechanism missingness (when different missingness patterns co-exist in the data) and missingness shift (when the missingness mechanism changes between training and test) (ii) we evaluate imputers holistically, based on imputation quality and imputation fairness, as well as on the predictive performance, fairness and stability of the models that are trained and tested on the data post-imputation.
  We use Shades-of-Null to conduct a large-scale empirical study involving 29,736 experimental pipelines, and find that while there is no single best-performing imputation approach for all missingness types, interesting trade-offs arise between predictive performance, fairness and stability, based on the combination of missingness scenario, imputer choice, and the architecture of the predictive model. We make Shades-of-Null publicly available, to enable researchers to rigorously evaluate missing value imputation methods on a wide range of metrics in plausible and socially meaningful scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLMs), systematic evaluation, and evolutionary algorithms has enabled breakthroughs in combinatorial optimization and scientific discovery. We propose to extend this powerful combination to the control of dynamical systems, generating interpretable control policies capable of complex behaviors. With our novel method, we represent control policies as programs in standard languages like Python. We evaluate candidate controllers in simulation and evolve them using a pre-trained LLM. Unlike conventional learning-based control techniques, which rely on black-box neural networks to encode control policies, our approach enhances transparency and interpretability. We still take advantage of the power of large AI models, but only at the policy design phase, ensuring that all system components remain interpretable and easily verifiable at runtime. Additionally, the use of standard programming languages makes it straightforward for humans to finetune or adapt the controllers based on their expertise and intuition. We illustrate our method through its application to the synthesis of an interpretable control policy for the pendulum swing-up and the ball in cup tasks. We make the code available at https://github.com/muellerlab/synthesizing_interpretable_control_policies.git.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents AutoEval, a novel benchmark for scaling Large Language Model (LLM) assessment in formal tasks with clear notions of correctness, such as truth maintenance in translation and logical reasoning. AutoEval is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on AutoEval is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Bokade, Xiaoning Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient traffic control (TSC) is essential for urban mobility, but traditional systems struggle to handle the complexity of real-world traffic. Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers adaptive solutions, but online MARL requires extensive interactions with the environment, making it costly and impractical. Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical traffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous behavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates learning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Taioli, Edoardo Zorzi, Gianni Franchi, Alberto Castellini, Alessandro Farinelli, Marco Cristani, Yiming Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-driven instance object navigation assumes that human users initiate the task by providing a detailed description of the target instance to the embodied agent. While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes. Code and benchmark will be available upon acceptance at https://intelligolabs.github.io/CoIN/</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of how a trusted, but computationally bounded agent (a 'verifier') can learn to interact with one or more powerful but untrusted agents ('provers') in order to solve a given task. More specifically, we study the case in which agents are represented using neural networks and refer to solutions of this problem as neural interactive proofs. First we introduce a unifying framework based on prover-verifier games, which generalises previously proposed interaction protocols. We then describe several new protocols for generating neural interactive proofs, and provide a theoretical comparison of both new and existing approaches. Finally, we support this theory with experiments in two domains: a toy graph isomorphism problem that illustrates the key ideas, and a code validation task using large language models. In so doing, we aim to create a foundation for future work on neural interactive proofs and their application in building safer AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Idahl, Zahra Ahmadi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present OpenReviewer, an open-source system for generating high-quality peer reviews of machine learning and AI conference papers. At its core is Llama-OpenReviewer-8B, an 8B parameter language model specifically fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews from top conferences. Given a PDF paper submission and review template as input, OpenReviewer extracts the full text, including technical content like equations and tables, and generates a structured review following conference-specific guidelines. Our evaluation on 400 test papers shows that OpenReviewer produces considerably more critical and realistic reviews compared to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5. While other LLMs tend toward overly positive assessments, OpenReviewer's recommendations closely match the distribution of human reviewer ratings. The system provides authors with rapid, constructive feedback to improve their manuscripts before submission, though it is not intended to replace human peer review. OpenReviewer is available as an online demo and open-source tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean Memery, Kevin Denamganai, Jiaxin Zhang, Zehai Tu, Yiwen Guo, Kartic Subr</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an interactive and explainable automated coaching assistant called CueTip for a variant of pool/billiards. CueTip's novelty lies in its combination of three features: a natural-language interface, an ability to perform contextual, physics-aware reasoning, and that its explanations are rooted in a set of predetermined guidelines developed by domain experts. We instrument a physics simulator so that it generates event traces in natural language alongside traditional state traces. Event traces lend themselves to interpretation by language models, which serve as the interface to our assistant. We design and train a neural adaptor that decouples tactical choices made by CueTip from its interactivity and explainability allowing it to be reconfigured to mimic any pool playing agent. Our experiments show that CueTip enables contextual query-based assistance and explanations while maintaining the strength of the agent in terms of win rate (improving it in some situations). The explanations generated by CueTip are physically-aware and grounded in the expert rules and are therefore more reliable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Toles, Nikhil Balwani, Rattandeep Singh, Valentina Giulia Sartori Rodriguez, Zhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijie Wang, Zhong-Zhi Li, Fei Yin, Dekang Ran, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts across various datasets. However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into transportation planning has the potential to revolutionize tasks such as demand forecasting, infrastructure design, policy evaluation, and traffic simulation. However, there is a critical need for a systematic framework to guide the adoption of GenAI in this interdisciplinary domain. In this survey, we, a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and transportation engineering, present the first comprehensive framework for leveraging GenAI in transportation planning. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes existing applications and methodologies into two perspectives: transportation planning tasks and computational techniques. From the transportation planning perspective, we examine the role of GenAI in automating descriptive, predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable tasks to enhance mobility systems. From the computational perspective, we detail advancements in data preparation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and inference strategies, such as retrieval-augmented generation and zero-shot learning tailored to transportation applications. Additionally, we address critical challenges, including data scarcity, explainability, bias mitigation, and the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that align with transportation goals like sustainability, equity, and system efficiency. This survey aims to bridge the gap between traditional transportation planning methodologies and modern AI techniques, fostering collaboration and innovation. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, we seek to inspire future research that ensures ethical, equitable, and impactful use of generative AI in transportation planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyan Xu, Khoi Duc Nguyen, Preeti Mukherjee, Saurabh Bagchi, Somali Chaterji, Yingyu Liang, Yin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent efforts on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Y. Chang, Longling Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent LLM-based agent frameworks have demonstrated impressive capabilities in task delegation and workflow orchestration, but face significant challenges in maintaining context awareness and ensuring planning consistency. This paper presents SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent framework that addresses four fundamental limitations in current LLM approaches: inadequate self-validation, context narrowing, lacking transaction properties, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. By implementing specialized context management agents and validation protocols, SagaLLM preserves critical constraints and state information throughout complex planning processes, enabling robust and consistent decision-making even during disruptions. We evaluate our approach using selected problems from the REALM benchmark, focusing on sequential and reactive planning scenarios that challenge both context retention and adaptive reasoning. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1, demonstrate that while these models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities, they struggle with maintaining global constraint awareness during complex planning tasks, particularly when adapting to unexpected changes. In contrast, the distributed cognitive architecture of SagaLLM shows significant improvements in planning consistency, constraint enforcement, and adaptation to disruptions in various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhu Yao, Kevin Wang, Ryan Hsieh, Haisu Zhou, Tianqing Zou, Zerui Cheng, Zhangyang Wang, Pramod Viswanath</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website: https://spinbench.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the significance of natural language in enhancing the controllability of generative models. While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the quest to understand and model data-generating processes (DGPs) is of paramount importance. Deep generative models (DGMs) have proven adept in capturing complex data distributions but often fall short in generalization and interpretability. On the other hand, causality offers a structured lens to comprehend the mechanisms driving data generation and highlights the causal-effect dynamics inherent in these processes. While causality excels in interpretability and the ability to extrapolate, it grapples with intricacies of high-dimensional spaces. Recognizing the synergistic potential, we delve into the confluence of causality and DGMs. We elucidate the integration of causal principles within DGMs, investigate causal identification using DGMs, and navigate an emerging research frontier of causality in large-scale generative models, particularly generative large language models (LLMs). We offer insights into methodologies, highlight open challenges, and suggest future directions, positioning our comprehensive review as an essential guide in this swiftly emerging and evolving area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjian Meng, Youzhi Zhang, Zhenxing Ge, Shangdong Yang, Tianyu Ding, Wenbin Li, Tianpei Yang, Bo An, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: To establish last-iterate convergence for Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithms in learning a Nash equilibrium (NE) of extensive-form games (EFGs), recent studies reformulate learning an NE of the original EFG as learning the NEs of a sequence of (perturbed) regularized EFGs. Consequently, proving last-iterate convergence in solving the original EFG reduces to proving last-iterate convergence in solving (perturbed) regularized EFGs. However, the empirical convergence rates of the algorithms in these studies are suboptimal, since they do not utilize Regret Matching (RM)-based CFR algorithms to solve perturbed EFGs, which are known the exceptionally fast empirical convergence rates. Additionally, since solving multiple perturbed regularized EFGs is required, fine-tuning across all such games is infeasible, making parameter-free algorithms highly desirable. In this paper, we prove that CFR$^+$, a classical parameter-free RM-based CFR algorithm, achieves last-iterate convergence in learning an NE of perturbed regularized EFGs. Leveraging CFR$^+$ to solve perturbed regularized EFGs, we get Reward Transformation CFR$^+$ (RTCFR$^+$). Importantly, we extend prior work on the parameter-free property of CFR$^+$, enhancing its stability, which is crucial for the empirical convergence of RTCFR$^+$. Experiments show that RTCFR$^+$ significantly outperforms existing algorithms with theoretical last-iterate convergence guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StochGradAdam, a novel optimizer designed as an extension of the Adam algorithm, incorporating stochastic gradient sampling techniques to improve computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance. StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Providing natural language explanations for recommendations is particularly useful from the perspective of a non-expert user. Although several methods for providing such explanations have recently been proposed, we argue that an important aspect of explanation quality has been overlooked in their experimental evaluation. Specifically, the coherence between generated text and predicted rating, which is a necessary condition for an explanation to be useful, is not properly captured by currently used evaluation measures. In this paper, we highlight the issue of explanation and prediction coherence by 1) presenting results from a manual verification of explanations generated by one of the state-of-the-art approaches 2) proposing a method of automatic coherence evaluation 3) introducing a new transformer-based method that aims to produce more coherent explanations than the state-of-the-art approaches 4) performing an experimental evaluation which demonstrates that this method significantly improves the explanation coherence without affecting the other aspects of recommendation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumick Chatterjee, Franziska Gaidzik, Alessandro Sciarra, Hendrik Mattern, G\'abor Janiga, Oliver Speck, Andreas N\"urnberger, Sahani Pathiraja</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of medical imaging, many supervised learning based methods for segmentation face several challenges such as high variability in annotations from multiple experts, paucity of labelled data and class imbalanced datasets. These issues may result in segmentations that lack the requisite precision for clinical analysis and can be misleadingly overconfident without associated uncertainty quantification. This work proposes the PULASki method as a computationally efficient generative tool for biomedical image segmentation that accurately captures variability in expert annotations, even in small datasets. This approach makes use of an improved loss function based on statistical distances in a conditional variational autoencoder structure (Probabilistic UNet), which improves learning of the conditional decoder compared to the standard cross-entropy particularly in class imbalanced problems. The proposed method was analysed for two structurally different segmentation tasks (intracranial vessel and multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion) and compare our results to four well-established baselines in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative output. These experiments involve class-imbalanced datasets characterised by challenging features, including suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios and high ambiguity. Empirical results demonstrate the PULASKi method outperforms all baselines at the 5\% significance level. Our experiments are also of the first to present a comparative study of the computationally feasible segmentation of complex geometries using 3D patches and the traditional use of 2D slices. The generated segmentations are shown to be much more anatomically plausible than in the 2D case, particularly for the vessel task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmood A. Jumaah, Yossra H. Ali, Tarik A. Rashid</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning algorithms, the hyperparameters tuning method refers to choosing the optimal parameters that may increase the overall performance. Manual or random hyperparameter tuning methods can lead to different results in the reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new method called QF-tuner for automatic hyperparameter tuning in the Q learning algorithm using the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX). Furthermore, a new objective function has been employed within FOX that prioritizes reward over learning error and time. QF tuner starts by running the FOX and tries to minimize the fitness value derived from observations at each iteration by executing the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using two control tasks from the OpenAI Gym: CartPole and FrozenLake. The empirical results indicate that the QF-tuner outperforms other optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), bees algorithm (BA), genetic algorithms (GA), and the random method. However, on the FrozenLake task, the QF-tuner increased rewards by 36% and reduced learning time by 26%, while on the CartPole task, it increased rewards by 57% and reduced learning time by 20%. Thus, the QF-tuner is an essential method for hyperparameter tuning in Q-learning algorithms, enabling more effective solutions to control task problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Object detectors often perform poorly on data that differs from their training set. Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) methods have recently demonstrated strong results on addressing this challenge. Unfortunately, we identify systemic benchmarking pitfalls that call past results into question and hamper further progress: (a) Overestimation of performance due to underpowered baselines, (b) Inconsistent implementation practices preventing transparent comparisons of methods, and (c) Lack of generality due to outdated backbones and lack of diversity in benchmarks. We address these problems by introducing: (1) A unified benchmarking and implementation framework, Align and Distill (ALDI), enabling comparison of DAOD methods and supporting future development, (2) A fair and modern training and evaluation protocol for DAOD that addresses benchmarking pitfalls, (3) A new DAOD benchmark dataset, CFC-DAOD, enabling evaluation on diverse real-world data, and (4) A new method, ALDI++, that achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin. ALDI++ outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by +3.5 AP50 on Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes, +5.7 AP50 on Sim10k to Cityscapes (where ours is the only method to outperform a fair baseline), and +0.6 AP50 on CFC Kenai to Channel. ALDI and ALDI++ are architecture-agnostic, setting a new state-of-the-art for YOLO and DETR-based DAOD as well without additional hyperparameter tuning. Our framework, dataset, and state-of-the-art method offer a critical reset for DAOD and provide a strong foundation for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yumeng Li, William Beluch, Margret Keuper, Dan Zhang, Anna Khoreva</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis, open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients: 1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Nicu Sebe, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly evolving technology with expanding applications across various fields. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent ML applications in agriculture for sustainability and efficiency. Existing reviews mainly focus on narrow subdomains or lack a fusion-driven perspectives. This study provides a combined analysis of ML applications in agriculture, structured around five key objectives: (i) Analyzing ML techniques across pre-harvesting, harvesting, and post-harvesting phases. (ii) Demonstrating how ML can be used with agricultural data and data fusion. (iii) Conducting a bibliometric and statistical analysis to reveal research trends and activity. (iv) Investigating real-world case studies of leading artificial intelligence (AI)-driven agricultural companies that use different types of multisensors and multisource data. (v) Compiling publicly available datasets to support ML model training. Going beyond existing previous reviews, this review focuses on how machine learning (ML) techniques, combined with multi-source data fusion (integrating remote sensing, IoT, and climate analytics), enhance precision agriculture by improving predictive accuracy and decision-making. Case studies and statistical insights illustrate the evolving landscape of AI driven smart farming, while future research directions also discusses challenges associated with data fusion for heterogeneous datasets. This review bridges the gap between AI research and agricultural applications, offering a roadmap for researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers to harness information fusion and ML for advancing precision agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Futa Waseda, Antonio Tejero-de-Pablos, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. Our experiments show that MAT can effectively be applied to different VL models and tasks to improve adversarial robustness, outperforming previous efforts. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduard Poesina, Adriana Valentina Costache, Adrian-Gabriel Chifu, Josiane Mothe, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation has recently emerged as a viable alternative to text-to-image retrieval, driven by the visually impressive results of generative diffusion models. Although query performance prediction is an active research topic in information retrieval, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study that analyzes the difficulty of queries (referred to as prompts) in text-to-image generation, based on human judgments. To this end, we introduce the first dataset of prompts which are manually annotated in terms of image generation performance. Additionally, we extend these evaluations to text-to-image retrieval by collecting manual annotations that represent retrieval performance. We thus establish the first joint benchmark for prompt and query performance prediction (PQPP) across both tasks, comprising over 10K queries. Our benchmark enables (i) the comparative assessment of prompt/query difficulty in both image generation and image retrieval, and (ii) the evaluation of prompt/query performance predictors addressing both generation and retrieval. We evaluate several pre- and post-generation/retrieval performance predictors, thus providing competitive baselines for future research. Our benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eduard6421/PQPP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepa Tilwani, Christian O'Reilly</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately modeling effective connectivity (EC) is critical for understanding how the brain processes and integrates sensory information. Yet, it remains a formidable challenge due to complex neural dynamics and noisy measurements such as those obtained from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Model-driven EC infers local (within a brain region) and global (between brain regions) EC parameters by fitting a generative model of neural activity onto experimental data. This approach offers a promising route for various applications, including investigating neurodevelopmental disorders. However, current approaches fail to scale to whole-brain analyses and are highly noise-sensitive. In this work, we employ three deep-learning architectures--a transformer, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a convolutional neural network and bidirectional LSTM (CNN-BiLSTM) network--for inverse modeling and compare their performance with simulation-based inference in estimating the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) parameters from simulated EEG data under various noise conditions. We demonstrate a reliable estimation of key local parameters, such as synaptic gains and time constants. However, other parameters like local JR-NMM connectivity cannot be evaluated reliably from evoked-related potentials (ERP). We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to characterize the influence of JR-NMM parameters on ERP and evaluate their learnability. Our results show the feasibility of deep-learning approaches to estimate the subset of learnable JR-NMM parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhi Pei, Rui Yan, Kaiyuan Gao, Jinhua Zhu, Lijun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of molecular and natural language representations has emerged as a focal point in molecular science, with recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) demonstrating significant potential for comprehensive modeling of both domains. However, existing approaches face notable limitations, particularly in their neglect of three-dimensional (3D) information, which is crucial for understanding molecular structures and functions. While some efforts have been made to incorporate 3D molecular information into LMs using external structure encoding modules, significant difficulties remain, such as insufficient interaction across modalities in pre-training and challenges in modality alignment. To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{3D-MolT5}, a unified framework designed to model molecule in both sequence and 3D structure spaces. The key innovation of our approach lies in mapping fine-grained 3D substructure representations into a specialized 3D token vocabulary. This methodology facilitates the seamless integration of sequence and structure representations in a tokenized format, enabling 3D-MolT5 to encode molecular sequences, molecular structures, and text sequences within a unified architecture. Leveraging this tokenized input strategy, we build a foundation model that unifies the sequence and structure data formats. We then conduct joint pre-training with multi-task objectives to enhance the model's comprehension of these diverse modalities within a shared representation space. Thus, our approach significantly improves cross-modal interaction and alignment, addressing key challenges in previous work. Further instruction tuning demonstrated that our 3D-MolT5 has strong generalization ability and surpasses existing methods with superior performance in multiple downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Xiao, Di Wang, Xuan Wu, Yuesong Wu, Boyang Li, Wei Du, Liupu Wang, You Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural models produce promising results when solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs), but often fall short in generalization. Recent attempts to enhance model generalization often incur unnecessarily large training cost or cannot be directly applied to other models solving different VRP variants. To address these issues, we take a novel perspective on model architecture in this study. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Entropy-based Scaling Factor (ESF) and a Distribution-Specific (DS) decoder to enhance the size and distribution generalization, respectively. ESF adjusts the attention weight pattern of the model towards familiar ones discovered during training when solving VRPs of varying sizes. The DS decoder explicitly models VRPs of multiple training distribution patterns through multiple auxiliary light decoders, expanding the model representation space to encompass a broader range of distributional scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and widely recognized real-world benchmarking datasets and compare the performance with seven baseline models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using ESF and DS decoder to obtain a more generalizable model and showcase their applicability to solve different VRP variants, i.e., travelling salesman problem and capacitated VRP. Notably, our proposed generic components require minimal computational resources, and can be effortlessly integrated into conventional generalization strategies to further elevate model generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to be trained on vast amounts of data, which may unintentionally or intentionally include data from commonly used benchmarks. This inclusion can lead to cheatingly high scores on model leaderboards, yet result in disappointing performance in real-world applications. To address this benchmark contamination problem, we first propose a set of requirements that practical contamination detection methods should follow. Following these proposed requirements, we introduce PaCoST, a Paired Confidence Significance Testing to effectively detect benchmark contamination in LLMs. Our method constructs a counterpart for each piece of data with the same distribution, and performs statistical analysis of the corresponding confidence to test whether the model is significantly more confident under the original benchmark. We validate the effectiveness of PaCoST and apply it on popular open-source models and benchmarks. We find that almost all models and benchmarks we tested are suspected contaminated more or less. We finally call for new LLM evaluation methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compared with real-time multi-object tracking (MOT), offline multi-object tracking (OMOT) has the advantages to perform 2D-3D detection fusion, erroneous link correction, and full track optimization but has to deal with the challenges from bounding box misalignment and track evaluation, editing, and refinement. This paper proposes "BiTrack", a 3D OMOT framework that includes modules of 2D-3D detection fusion, initial trajectory generation, and bidirectional trajectory re-optimization to achieve optimal tracking results from camera-LiDAR data. The novelty of this paper includes threefold: (1) development of a point-level object registration technique that employs a density-based similarity metric to achieve accurate fusion of 2D-3D detection results; (2) development of a set of data association and track management skills that utilizes a vertex-based similarity metric as well as false alarm rejection and track recovery mechanisms to generate reliable bidirectional object trajectories; (3) development of a trajectory re-optimization scheme that re-organizes track fragments of different fidelities in a greedy fashion, as well as refines each trajectory with completion and smoothing techniques. The experiment results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that BiTrack achieves the state-of-the-art performance for 3D OMOT tasks in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in academia has spurred a global discourse on their potential pedagogical benefits and ethical considerations. Positive reactions highlight some potential, such as collaborative creativity, increased access to education, and empowerment of trainers and trainees. However, negative reactions raise concerns about ethical complexities, balancing innovation and academic integrity, unequal access, and misinformation risks. Through a systematic survey and text-mining-based analysis of global and national directives, insights from independent research, and eighty university-level guidelines, this study provides a nuanced understanding of the opportunities and challenges posed by GAI and LLMs in education. It emphasizes the importance of balanced approaches that harness the benefits of these technologies while addressing ethical considerations and ensuring equitable access and educational outcomes. The paper concludes with recommendations for fostering responsible innovation and ethical practices to guide the integration of GAI and LLMs in academia.</p>

<p>Abstract: The definition of Data Science is a hotly debated topic. For many, the definition is a simple shortcut to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. However, there is far more depth and nuance to the field of Data Science than a simple shortcut can provide. The School of Data Science at the University of Virginia has developed a novel model for the definition of Data Science. This model is based on identifying a unified understanding of the data work done across all areas of Data Science. It represents a generational leap forward in how we understand and teach Data Science. In this paper we will present the core features of the model and explain how it unifies various concepts going far beyond the analytics component of AI. From this foundation we will present our Undergraduate Major curriculum in Data Science and demonstrate how it prepares students to be well-rounded Data Science team members and leaders. The paper will conclude with an in-depth overview of the Foundations of Data Science course designed to introduce students to the field while also implementing proven STEM oriented pedagogical methods. These include, for example, specifications grading, active learning lectures, guest lectures from industry experts and weekly gamification labs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sa\"uc Abadal Lloret, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Keerthiram Murugesan, Mrinmaya Sachan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ALT (ALignment with Textual feedback), an approach that aligns language models with user preferences expressed in text. We argue that text offers greater expressiveness, enabling users to provide richer feedback than simple comparative preferences and this richer feedback can lead to more efficient and effective alignment. ALT aligns the model by conditioning its generation on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language modeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it still presents the main benefits of RL-based alignment algorithms and can effectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency of textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialog response generation. We find that ALT outperforms PPO for the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on summarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used with feedback provided by an existing LLM where we explore an LLM providing constrained and unconstrained textual feedback. We also outline future directions to align models with natural language feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of large language models leads to the formation of a pre-train-then-align paradigm, in which the model is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and undergoes a tuning stage to align the model with human preference or downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints. Our results on 18 datasets suggest that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the model resembles high sensitivity to evaluation prompts after supervised fine-tuning, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection plays a key role in high-level visual understanding, facilitating a deep comprehension of human activities. Specifically, HOI detection aims to locate the humans and objects involved in interactions within images or videos and classify the specific interactions between them. The success of this task is influenced by several key factors, including the accurate localization of human and object instances, as well as the correct classification of object categories and interaction relationships. This paper systematically summarizes and discusses the recent work in image-based HOI detection. First, the mainstream datasets involved in HOI relationship detection are introduced. Furthermore, starting with two-stage methods and end-to-end one-stage detection approaches, this paper comprehensively discusses the current developments in image-based HOI detection, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these two methods. Additionally, the advancements of zero-shot learning, weakly supervised learning, and the application of large-scale language models in HOI detection are discussed. Finally, the current challenges in HOI detection are outlined, and potential research directions and future trends are explored.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. More details can be found on our website https://ruiiu.github.io/imrl.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omayma Mahjoub, Sasha Abramowitz, Ruan de Kock, Wiem Khlifi, Simon du Toit, Jemma Daniel, Louay Ben Nessir, Louise Beyers, Claude Formanek, Liam Clark, Arnu Pretorius</p>
<p>Abstract: As multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards solving larger and more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important that algorithms exhibit the key properties of (1) strong performance, (2) memory efficiency and (3) scalability. In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory efficient and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks (Sun et al., 2023) to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingren Yao, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Renhe Jiang, Yuxuan Liang, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulun Wu, Louie McConnell, Claudia Iriondo</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating an individual's counterfactual outcomes under interventions is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in the observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage disentangled exogenous noise abduction that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Kazdan, Rylan Schaeffer, Apratim Dey, Matthias Gerstgrasser, Rafael Rafailov, David L. Donoho, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: What happens when generative machine learning models are pretrained on web-scale datasets containing data generated by earlier models? Some prior work warns of "model collapse" as the web is overwhelmed by synthetic data; other work suggests the problem can be contained (i.e. collapse can be avoided) by managing how available data are used in pretraining. In this paper, we report experiments on three ways of using data (training-workflows), across three generative model task-settings (multivariate Gaussian estimation, kernel density estimation, and language-model fine-tuning) to further confirm the possibility of containment: (a) we confirm that the training-workflow of {\it replacing} all real data by successive generations of purely synthetic data indeed suffers model collapse in all task-settings studied; (b) we consider the training-workflow of {\it accumulating} synthetic data alongside real data and training on all data combined and confirming that, although the proportion of real data eventually becomes zero, models remain stable and their test losses do not diverge under this training-workflow; (c) we consider a training-workflow where real and synthetic data accumulate together but successive generations of pretraining are constrained to use fixed-size data subsets each generation. In this workflow, we observe slow and gradual rather than explosive degradation of test loss performance across generations. Our insights are particularly important when forecasting whether future frontier generative models will collapse or thrive, and our results open avenues for empirically and mathematically studying the context-dependent value of synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liam Moroy, Guillaume Bourmaud, Fr\'ed\'eric Champagnat, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Giovannelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Plug&Play (PnP) diffusion models are state-of-the-art methods in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Such methods usually consider applications where the sinogram contains a sufficient amount of information for the posterior distribution to be concentrated around a single mode, and consequently are evaluated using image-to-image metrics such as PSNR/SSIM. Instead, we are interested in reconstructing compressible flow images from sinograms having a small number of projections, which results in a posterior distribution no longer concentrated or even multimodal. Thus, in this paper, we aim at evaluating the approximate posterior of PnP diffusion models and introduce two posterior evaluation properties. We quantitatively evaluate three PnP diffusion methods on three different datasets for several numbers of projections. We surprisingly find that, for each method, the approximate posterior deviates from the true posterior when the number of projections decreases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongtao Huang, Chengkai Huang, Tong Yu, Xiaojun Chang, Wen Hu, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promising results in sequential recommendation (SR). Existing approaches predominantly rely on implicit conditional diffusion models, which compress user behaviors into a single representation during the forward diffusion process. While effective to some extent, this oversimplification often leads to the loss of sequential and contextual information, which is critical for understanding user behavior. Moreover, explicit information, such as user-item interactions or sequential patterns, remains underutilized, despite its potential to directly guide the recommendation process and improve precision. However, combining implicit and explicit information is non-trivial, as it requires dynamically integrating these complementary signals while avoiding noise and irrelevant patterns within user behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Conditional Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation (DCRec), which effectively integrates implicit and explicit information by embedding dual conditions into both the forward and reverse diffusion processes. This allows the model to retain valuable sequential and contextual information while leveraging explicit user-item interactions to guide the recommendation process. Specifically, we introduce the Dual Conditional Diffusion Transformer (DCDT), which employs a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate explicit signals throughout the diffusion stages, ensuring contextual understanding and minimizing the influence of irrelevant patterns. This design enables precise and contextually relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuki Shirai, Tong Zhao, H. J. Terry Suh, Huaijiang Zhu, Xinpei Ni, Jiuguang Wang, Max Simchowitz, Tao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Bagheri Nezhad, Sayan Bandyapadhyay, Ameeta Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization of user-generated content remains a critical challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods often fail to ensure equitable representation across different social groups, leading to biased outputs. In this paper, we introduce two novel methods for fair extractive summarization: FairExtract, a clustering-based approach, and FairGPT, which leverages GPT-3.5-turbo with fairness constraints. We evaluate these methods using Divsumm summarization dataset of White-aligned, Hispanic, and African-American dialect tweets and compare them against relevant baselines. The results obtained using a comprehensive set of summarization quality metrics such as SUPERT, BLANC, SummaQA, BARTScore, and UniEval, as well as a fairness metric F, demonstrate that FairExtract and FairGPT achieve superior fairness while maintaining competitive summarization quality. Additionally, we introduce composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F, BLANC+F) that integrate quality and fairness into a single evaluation framework, offering a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between these objectives. Our code is available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanbin Man, Ying Huang, Chengming Zhang, Bingzhe Li, Wei Niu, Miao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Eaton</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we describe an efficient method for providing a regression model with a sense of curiosity about its data. In the field of machine learning, our framework for representing curiosity is called Active Learning, which concerns the problem of automatically choosing data points for which to query labels in the semi-supervised setting. The methods we propose are based on computing a "regularity tangent" vector that can be calculated (with only a constant slow-down) together with the model's parameter vector during training. We then take the inner product of this tangent vector with the gradient vector of the model's loss at a given data point to obtain a measure of the influence of that point on the complexity of the model. In the simplest instantiation, there is only a single regularity tangent vector, of the same dimension as the parameter vector. Thus, in the proposed technique, once training is complete, evaluating our "curiosity" about a potential query data point can be done as quickly as calculating the model's loss gradient at that point. The new vector only doubles the amount of storage required by the model. We show that the quantity computed by our technique is an example of an "influence function", and that it measures the expected squared change in model complexity incurred by up-weighting a given data point. We propose a number of ways for using this and other related quantities to choose new training data points for a regression model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Storytelling video generation (SVG) aims to produce coherent and visually rich multi-scene videos that follow a structured narrative. Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and muti-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young-Jin Park, Carson Sobolewski, Navid Azizan</p>
<p>Abstract: DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has emerged as a promising architecture for object detection, offering an end-to-end prediction pipeline. In practice, however, DETR generates hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual number of objects present in an image. This raises the question: can we trust and use all of these predictions? Addressing this concern, we present empirical evidence highlighting how different predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels across those predictions. More specifically, while multiple predictions are often made for a single object, our findings show that most often one such prediction is well-calibrated, and the others are poorly calibrated. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that identifying a reliable subset of DETR's predictions is crucial for accurately assessing the reliability of the model at both object and image levels.
  Building on this viewpoint, we first address the shortcomings of widely used performance and calibration metrics, such as average precision and various forms of expected calibration error. Specifically, they are inadequate for determining which subset of DETR's predictions should be trusted and utilized. In response, we present Object-level Calibration Error (OCE), which assesses the calibration quality more effectively and is suitable for both ranking different models and identifying the most reliable predictions within a specific model. As a final contribution, we introduce a post hoc uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework that predicts the accuracy of the model on a per-image basis. By contrasting the average confidence scores of positive (i.e., likely to be matched) and negative predictions determined by OCE, our framework assesses the reliability of the DETR model for each test image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harold Haodong Chen, Harry Yang, Ser-Nam Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have outpaced progress in video editing, which remains constrained by several limiting factors, namely: (a) the task's dependency on supervision severely limits generality, (b) an unnecessary artificial separation between the generation and editing task, and (c) the high computational costs of training a video model. In this work, we propose UES (Unlocking Universal Editing via Self-Supervision), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning strategy that transforms generation models into unified generation-editing systems through self-supervised semantic alignment. Our approach establishes a dual-conditioning mechanism where original video-text pairs jointly provide visual and textual semantics, enabling structured learning of intrinsic spatiotemporal correspondences. Key advantages include: (i) Universality through supervision-free adaptation to diverse editing tasks, (ii) Unification of generation and editing applicable to most text(+image)-to-video model, and (iii) Efficiency via lightweight fine-tune that reduces tunable parameters by 92.67%. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce OmniBench-99, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 99 videos across humans/animals, environments, and objects, comprising 4 editing types and 8 scenarios. Extensive experiments show UES enables models without inherent editing capability to perform powerful and universal editing while preserving or even enhancing their original generation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueqing Wu, Yuheng Ding, Bingxuan Li, Pan Lu, Da Yin, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to critique and correct their reasoning is an essential building block towards their self-improvement. However, a systematic analysis of such capabilities in LVLMs is still lacking. We propose VISCO, the first benchmark to extensively analyze the fine-grained critique and correction capabilities of LVLMs. Compared to existing work that uses a single scalar value to critique the entire reasoning [4], VISCO features dense and fine-grained critique, requiring LVLMs to evaluate the correctness of each step in the chain-of-thought and provide natural language explanations to support their judgments. Extensive evaluation of 24 LVLMs demonstrates that human-written critiques significantly enhance the performance after correction, showcasing the potential of the self-improvement strategy. However, the model-generated critiques are less helpful and sometimes detrimental to the performance, suggesting that critique is the crucial bottleneck. We identified three common patterns in critique failures: failure to critique visual perception, reluctance to "say no", and exaggerated assumption of error propagation. To address these issues, we propose an effective LookBack strategy that revisits the image to verify each piece of information in the initial reasoning. LookBack significantly improves critique and correction performance by up to 13.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namgyu Kang, Jaemin Oh, Youngjoon Hong, Eunbyung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks has seen significant advancements through Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Despite their straightforward optimization framework and flexibility in implementing various PDEs, PINNs often suffer from limited accuracy due to the spectral bias of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which struggle to effectively learn high-frequency and nonlinear components. Recently, parametric mesh representations in combination with neural networks have been investigated as a promising approach to eliminate the inductive bias of MLPs. However, they usually require high-resolution grids and a large number of collocation points to achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting. In addition, the fixed positions of the mesh parameters restrict their flexibility, making accurate approximation of complex PDEs challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose Physics-Informed Gaussians (PIGs), which combine feature embeddings using Gaussian functions with a lightweight neural network. Our approach uses trainable parameters for the mean and variance of each Gaussian, allowing for dynamic adjustment of their positions and shapes during training. This adaptability enables our model to optimally approximate PDE solutions, unlike models with fixed parameter positions. Furthermore, the proposed approach maintains the same optimization framework used in PINNs, allowing us to benefit from their excellent properties. Experimental results show the competitive performance of our model across various PDEs, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for solving complex PDEs.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for modeling and conditional generation of 3D articulated objects. Troubled by flexibility-quality tradeoffs, existing methods are often limited to using predefined structures or retrieving shapes from static datasets. To address these challenges, we parameterize an articulated object as a tree of tokens and employ a transformer to generate both the object's high-level geometry code and its kinematic relations. Subsequently, each sub-part's geometry is further decoded using a signed-distance-function (SDF) shape prior, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality 3D shapes. Our approach enables the generation of diverse objects with high-quality geometry and varying number of parts. Comprehensive experiments on conditional generation from text descriptions demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the increasing abuse of fraudulent activities that result in significant financial and reputational harm, Ethereum smart contracts face a significant problem in detecting fraud. Existing monitoring methods typically rely on lease code analysis or physically extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we use graph representation learning to observe purchase trends and find fraudulent deals. We can achieve powerful categorisation performance by using innovative machine learning versions and transforming Ethereum invoice data into graph structures. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron ( MLP ) and Graph Convolutional Networks ( GCN). Experimental results show that the MLP type surpasses the GCN in this environment, with domain-specific assessments closely aligned with real-world assessments. This study provides a scalable and efficient way to improve Ethereum's ecosystem's confidence and security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hari Hara Suthan Chittoor, Paul Robert Griffin, Ariel Neufeld, Jayne Thompson, Mile Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) involves predicting a large number of future values of a time series based on the past values. This is an essential task in a wide range of domains including weather forecasting, stock market analysis and disease outbreak prediction. Over the decades LTSF algorithms have transitioned from statistical models to deep learning models like transformer models. Despite the complex architecture of transformer based LTSF models `Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? (Zeng et al., 2023)' showed that simple linear models can outperform the state-of-the-art transformer based LTSF models. Recently, quantum machine learning (QML) is evolving as a domain to enhance the capabilities of classical machine learning models. In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF. Through extensive experiments on a widely used weather dataset we show the advantages of QuLTSF over the state-of-the-art classical linear models, in terms of reduced mean squared error and mean absolute error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Manasyan, Maximilian Seitzer, Filip Radovic, Georg Martius, Andrii Zadaianchuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning from videos is a promising approach to extract structured representations from large, unlabeled collections of videos. To support downstream tasks like autonomous control, these representations must be both compositional and temporally consistent. Existing approaches based on recurrent processing often lack long-term stability across frames because their training objective does not enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel object-level temporal contrastive loss for video object-centric models that explicitly promotes temporal consistency. Our method significantly improves the temporal consistency of the learned object-centric representations, yielding more reliable video decompositions that facilitate challenging downstream tasks such as unsupervised object dynamics prediction. Furthermore, the inductive bias added by our loss strongly improves object discovery, leading to state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming even weakly-supervised methods that leverage motion masks as additional cues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Cao, Yuan Zhang, Tao Huang, Ming Lu, Qizhe Zhang, Ruichuan An, Ningning MA, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual encoders are fundamental components in vision-language models (VLMs), each showcasing unique strengths derived from various pre-trained visual foundation models. To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers. Comprehensive experiments on popular VLMs, such as LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hey-cjj/MoVE-KD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Romeo, Girolamo Macaluso, Alessandro Sestini, Andrew D. Bagdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: High update-to-data (UTD) ratio algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL) improve sample efficiency but incur high computational costs, limiting real-world scalability. We propose Offline Stabilization Phases for Efficient Q-Learning (SPEQ), an RL algorithm that combines low-UTD online training with periodic offline stabilization phases. During these phases, Q-functions are fine-tuned with high UTD ratios on a fixed replay buffer, reducing redundant updates on suboptimal data. This structured training schedule optimally balances computational and sample efficiency, addressing the limitations of both high and low UTD ratio approaches. We empirically demonstrate that SPEQ requires from 40% to 99% fewer gradient updates and 27% to 78% less training time compared to state-of-the-art high UTD ratio methods while maintaining or surpassing their performance on the MuJoCo continuous control benchmark. Our findings highlight the potential of periodic stabilization phases as an effective alternative to conventional training schedules, paving the way for more scalable reinforcement learning solutions in real-world applications where computational resources are constrained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh D. Dhole</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation equips large language models with the capability to retrieve external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations by incorporating information beyond the model's intrinsic abilities. However, most prior works have focused on invoking retrieval deterministically, which makes it unsuitable for tasks such as long-form question answering. Instead, dynamically performing retrieval by invoking it only when the underlying LLM lacks the required knowledge can be more efficient. In this context, we delve deeper into the question, "To Retrieve or Not to Retrieve?" by exploring multiple uncertainty detection methods. We evaluate these methods for the task of long-form question answering, employing dynamic retrieval, and present our comparisons. Our findings suggest that uncertainty detection metrics, such as Degree Matrix Jaccard and Eccentricity, can reduce the number of retrieval calls by almost half, with only a slight reduction in question-answering accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Parameshwaran, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing formal verification methods for image-based neural network controllers in autonomous vehicles often struggle with high-dimensional inputs, computational inefficiency, and a lack of explainability. These challenges make it difficult to ensure safety and reliability, as processing high-dimensional image data is computationally intensive and neural networks are typically treated as black boxes. To address these issues, we propose SEVIN (Scalable and Explainable Verification of Image-Based Neural Network Controllers), a framework that leverages a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to encode high-dimensional images into a lower-dimensional, explainable latent space. By annotating latent variables with corresponding control actions, we generate convex polytopes that serve as structured input spaces for verification, significantly reducing computational complexity and enhancing scalability. Integrating the VAE's decoder with the neural network controller allows for formal and robustness verification using these explainable polytopes. Our approach also incorporates robustness verification under real-world perturbations by augmenting the dataset and retraining the VAE to capture environmental variations. Experimental results demonstrate that SEVIN achieves efficient and scalable verification while providing explainable insights into controller behavior, bridging the gap between formal verification techniques and practical applications in safety-critical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Lin, Shanda Li, Haotian Ye, Yiming Yang, Stefano Ermon, Yitao Liang, Jianzhu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gohar Irfan Chaudhry, Esha Choukse, \'I\~nigo Goiri, Rodrigo Fonseca, Adam Belay, Ricardo Bianchini</p>
<p>Abstract: Compound AI Systems, integrating multiple interacting components like models, retrievers, and external tools, have emerged as essential for addressing complex AI tasks. However, current implementations suffer from inefficient resource utilization due to tight coupling between application logic and execution details, a disconnect between orchestration and resource management layers, and the perceived exclusiveness between efficiency and quality.
  We propose a vision for resource-efficient Compound AI Systems through a declarative workflow programming model and an adaptive runtime system for dynamic scheduling and resource-aware decision-making. Decoupling application logic from low-level details exposes levers for the runtime to flexibly configure the execution environment and resources, without compromising on quality. Enabling collaboration between the workflow orchestration and cluster manager enables higher efficiency through better scheduling and resource management.
  We are building a prototype system, called Murakkab, to realize this vision. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates speedups up to $\sim 3.4\times$ in workflow completion times while delivering $\sim 4.5\times$ higher energy efficiency, showing promise in optimizing resources and advancing AI system design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Laughter serves as a multifaceted communicative signal in human interaction, yet its identification within dialogue presents a significant challenge for conversational AI systems. This study addresses this challenge by annotating laughable contexts in Japanese spontaneous text conversation data and developing a taxonomy to classify the underlying reasons for such contexts. Initially, multiple annotators manually labeled laughable contexts using a binary decision (laughable or non-laughable). Subsequently, an LLM was used to generate explanations for the binary annotations of laughable contexts, which were then categorized into a taxonomy comprising ten categories, including "Empathy and Affinity" and "Humor and Surprise," highlighting the diverse range of laughter-inducing scenarios. The study also evaluated GPT-4o's performance in recognizing the majority labels of laughable contexts, achieving an F1 score of 43.14%. These findings contribute to the advancement of conversational AI by establishing a foundation for more nuanced recognition and generation of laughter, ultimately fostering more natural and engaging human-AI interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Handling multi-party dialogues represents a significant step for advancing spoken dialogue systems, necessitating the development of tasks specific to multi-party interactions. To address this challenge, we are constructing a multi-modal multi-party dialogue corpus of triadic (three-participant) discussions. This paper focuses on the task of addressee recognition, identifying who is being addressed to take the next turn, a critical component unique to multi-party dialogue systems. A subset of the corpus was annotated with addressee information, revealing that explicit addressees are indicated in approximately 20% of conversational turns. To evaluate the task's complexity, we benchmarked the performance of a large language model (GPT-4o) on addressee recognition. The results showed that GPT-4o achieved an accuracy only marginally above chance, underscoring the challenges of addressee recognition in multi-party dialogue. These findings highlight the need for further research to enhance the capabilities of large language models in understanding and navigating the intricacies of multi-party conversational dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Salinas, Omar Swelam, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires costly human annotations. To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajiv Movva, Kenny Peng, Nikhil Garg, Jon Kleinberg, Emma Pierson</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe HypotheSAEs, a general method to hypothesize interpretable relationships between text data (e.g., headlines) and a target variable (e.g., clicks). HypotheSAEs has three steps: (1) train a sparse autoencoder on text embeddings to produce interpretable features describing the data distribution, (2) select features that predict the target variable, and (3) generate a natural language interpretation of each feature (e.g., "mentions being surprised or shocked") using an LLM. Each interpretation serves as a hypothesis about what predicts the target variable. Compared to baselines, our method better identifies reference hypotheses on synthetic datasets (at least +0.06 in F1) and produces more predictive hypotheses on real datasets (~twice as many significant findings), despite requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less compute than recent LLM-based methods. HypotheSAEs also produces novel discoveries on two well-studied tasks: explaining partisan differences in Congressional speeches and identifying drivers of engagement with online headlines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding time from visual representations is a fundamental cognitive skill, yet it remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusheng Dai, Chenxi Wang, Chang Li, Chen Wang, Jun Du, Kewei Li, Ruoyu Wang, Jiefeng Ma, Lei Sun, Jianqing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mogens Henrik From, Jacob Nielsen, Lukas Galke, Peter Schneider-Kamp</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large neural network models requires extensive computational resources, often distributed across several nodes and accelerators. Recent findings suggest that it may be sufficient to only exchange the fast moving components of the gradients, while accumulating momentum locally (Decoupled Momentum, or DeMo). However, when considering larger models that do not fit on a single accelerator, the exchange of gradient information and the integration of DeMo needs to be reconsidered. Here, we propose employing a hybrid sharded data parallel training strategy, FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully shard model parameters locally between different accelerators, while inter-node communication bandwidth requirements are reduced by synchronizing only fast-moving components instead of the full gradients. This effectively combines previous hybrid sharded strategies with the advantages of decoupled momentum. Our experimental results show that FlexDeMo is on par with hybrid sharded data parallel training employing AdamW and full gradient synchronization in terms of validation loss, demonstrating its viability. Furthermore, FlexDeMo achieves improved training speed compared to full gradient synchronization across nodes. In a bandwidth-constrained 2-node setup, FlexDeMo allows reaching desired levels of validation loss faster than hybrid sharded data parallel training with full gradient synchronization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vatsal Maru</p>
<p>Abstract: The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95% reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38% higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are increasingly leveraging sparsity to reduce the scaling up of model parameter size. However, reducing wall-clock time through sparsity and pruning remains challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to frequent cache misses. In this paper, we present NPU Vector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address cache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory patterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution to the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural solution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic support, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread alongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an average 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in general-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads versus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of incorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR. Our evaluation shows that expanding this modest cache delivers 5x higher performance benefits than increasing the L2 cache size by the same amount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weipeng Huang, Qin Li, Yang Xiao, Cheng Qiao, Tie Cai, Junwei Liao, Neil J. Hurley, Guangyuan Piao</p>
<p>Abstract: Noise in data appears to be inevitable in most real-world machine learning applications and would cause severe overfitting problems. Not only can data features contain noise, but labels are also prone to be noisy due to human input. In this paper, rather than noisy label learning in multiclass classifications, we instead focus on the less explored area of noisy label learning for multilabel classifications. Specifically, we investigate the post-correction of predictions generated from classifiers learned with noisy labels. The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, this approach can directly work with the trained models to save computational resources. Secondly, it could be applied on top of other noisy label correction techniques to achieve further improvements. To handle this problem, we appeal to deep generative approaches that are possible for uncertainty estimation. Our model posits that label noise arises from a stochastic shift in the latent variable, providing a more robust and beneficial means for noisy learning. We develop both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods for our model. The extensive empirical study presents solid evidence to that our approach is able to consistently improve the independent models and performs better than a number of existing methods across various noisy label settings. Moreover, a comprehensive empirical analysis of the proposed method is carried out to validate its robustness, including sensitivity analysis and an ablation study, among other elements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Bin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their ability to learn representations from graph data. Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client nodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing attacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain gradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation precludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address the above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL, referred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the local clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a contrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are trained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature information of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by node-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then, VGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and the gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive function. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification rules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node classification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA achieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guannan Lai, Yujie Li, Xiangkun Wang, Junbo Zhang, Tianrui Li, Xin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to enable models to learn new classes sequentially while retaining knowledge of previous ones. Although current methods have alleviated catastrophic forgetting (CF), recent studies highlight that the performance of CIL models is highly sensitive to the order of class arrival, particularly when sequentially introduced classes exhibit high inter-class similarity. To address this critical yet understudied challenge of class order sensitivity, we first extend existing CIL frameworks through theoretical analysis, proving that grouping classes with lower pairwise similarity during incremental phases significantly improves model robustness to order variations. Building on this insight, we propose Graph-Driven Dynamic Similarity Grouping (GDDSG), a novel method that employs graph coloring algorithms to dynamically partition classes into similarity-constrained groups. Each group trains an isolated CIL sub-model and constructs meta-features for class group identification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the issue of class order sensitivity while achieving optimal performance in both model accuracy and anti-forgetting capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerion Spielberger, Florian M. Artinger, Jochen Reb, Rudolf Kerschreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing textual data is the cornerstone of qualitative research. While traditional methods such as grounded theory and content analysis are widely used, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Topic modeling offers an automated complement. Yet, existing approaches, including LLM-based topic modeling, still struggle with issues such as high data preprocessing requirements, interpretability, and reliability. This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling. These results highlight Agentic RAG's ability to generate semantically relevant and reproducible topics, positioning it as a robust, scalable, and transparent alternative for AI-driven qualitative research in leadership, managerial, and organizational research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lily Xu, Bryan Wilder, Elias B. Khalil, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has increasingly been applied to solve real-world planning problems, with progress in handling large state spaces and time horizons. However, a key bottleneck in many domains is that RL methods cannot accommodate large, combinatorially structured action spaces. In such settings, even representing the set of feasible actions at a single step may require a complex discrete optimization formulation. We leverage recent advances in embedding trained neural networks into optimization problems to propose SEQUOIA, an RL algorithm that directly optimizes for long-term reward over the feasible action space. Our approach embeds a Q-network into a mixed-integer program to select a combinatorial action in each timestep. Here, we focus on planning over restless bandits, a class of planning problems which capture many real-world examples of sequential decision making. We introduce coRMAB, a broader class of restless bandits with combinatorial actions that cannot be decoupled across the arms of the restless bandit, requiring direct solving over the joint, exponentially large action space. We empirically validate SEQUOIA on four novel restless bandit problems with combinatorial constraints: multiple interventions, path constraints, bipartite matching, and capacity constraints. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods -- which cannot address sequential planning and combinatorial selection simultaneously -- by an average of 24.8\% on these difficult instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rylan Schaeffer, Joshua Kazdan, Alvan Caleb Arulandu, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content online has fueled concerns over \emph{model collapse}, a degradation in future generative models' performance when trained on synthetic data generated by earlier models. Industry leaders, premier research journals and popular science publications alike have prophesied catastrophic societal consequences stemming from model collapse. In this position piece, we contend this widespread narrative fundamentally misunderstands the scientific evidence. We highlight that research on model collapse actually encompasses eight distinct and at times conflicting definitions of model collapse, and argue that inconsistent terminology within and between papers has hindered building a comprehensive understanding of model collapse. To assess how significantly different interpretations of model collapse threaten future generative models, we posit what we believe are realistic conditions for studying model collapse and then conduct a rigorous assessment of the literature's methodologies through this lens. While we leave room for reasonable disagreement, our analysis of research studies, weighted by how faithfully each study matches real-world conditions, leads us to conclude that certain predicted claims of model collapse rely on assumptions and conditions that poorly match real-world conditions, and in fact several prominent collapse scenarios are readily avoidable. Altogether, this position paper argues that model collapse has been warped from a nuanced multifaceted consideration into an oversimplified threat, and that the evidence suggests specific harms more likely under society's current trajectory have received disproportionately less attention.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04833">Adversarial Training for Multimodal Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Liming Lu, Shuchao Pang, Siyuan Liang, Haotian Zhu, Xiyu Zeng, Aishan Liu, Yunhuai Liu, Yongbin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides in cross-modal comprehension and generation tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted perturbations bypass security guardrails and elicit harmful outputs. In this paper, we present the first adversarial training (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the MLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical challenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness against attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end AT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training architecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining computational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight projector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight allocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance defense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and image modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight the practical applicability of our framework, paving the way for the development of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Three-dimensional biological microscopy has significantly advanced our understanding of complex biological structures. However, limitations due to microscopy techniques, sample properties or phototoxicity often result in poor z-resolution, hindering accurate cellular measurements. Here, we introduce ZAugNet, a fast, accurate, and self-supervised deep learning method for enhancing z-resolution in biological images. By performing nonlinear interpolation between consecutive slices, ZAugNet effectively doubles resolution with each iteration. Compared on several microscopy modalities and biological objects, it outperforms competing methods on most metrics. Our method leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture combined with knowledge distillation to maximize prediction speed without compromising accuracy. We also developed ZAugNet+, an extended version enabling continuous interpolation at arbitrary distances, making it particularly useful for datasets with nonuniform slice spacing. Both ZAugNet and ZAugNet+ provide high-performance, scalable z-slice augmentation solutions for large-scale 3D imaging. They are available as open-source frameworks in PyTorch, with an intuitive Colab notebook interface for easy access by the scientific community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language (VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that fail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and cultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA culturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing datasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA, fostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically represent diverse cultures across SEA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Shi, Xiaodong Yu, Shengming Wang, Yijia Zhang, Lu Xu, Peng Pan, Chunlai Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose RFUAV as a new benchmark dataset for radio-frequency based (RF-based) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) identification and address the following challenges: Firstly, many existing datasets feature a restricted variety of drone types and insufficient volumes of raw data, which fail to meet the demands of practical applications. Secondly, existing datasets often lack raw data covering a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or do not provide tools for transforming raw data to different SNR levels. This limitation undermines the validity of model training and evaluation. Lastly, many existing datasets do not offer open-access evaluation tools, leading to a lack of unified evaluation standards in current research within this field. RFUAV comprises approximately 1.3 TB of raw frequency data collected from 37 distinct UAVs using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) device in real-world environments. Through in-depth analysis of the RF data in RFUAV, we define a drone feature sequence called RF drone fingerprint, which aids in distinguishing drone signals. In addition to the dataset, RFUAV provides a baseline preprocessing method and model evaluation tools. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that these preprocessing methods achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance using the provided evaluation tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Tariqul Islam, Jason W. Fleischer</p>
<p>Abstract: Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is among the most popular neighbor embedding methods. The method relies on attractive and repulsive forces among high-dimensional data points to obtain a low-dimensional embedding. In this paper, we analyze the forces to reveal their effects on cluster formations and visualization. Repulsion emphasizes differences, controlling cluster boundaries and inter-cluster distance. Attraction is more subtle, as attractive tension between points can manifest simultaneously as attraction and repulsion in the lower-dimensional mapping. This explains the need for learning rate annealing and motivates the different treatments between attractive and repulsive terms. Moreover, by modifying attraction, we improve the consistency of cluster formation under random initialization. Overall, our analysis makes UMAP and similar embedding methods more interpretable, more robust, and more accurate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihua Tian, Sirun Nan, Ming Xu, Shengfang Zhai, Wenjie Qu, Jian Liu, Kui Ren, Ruoxi Jia, Jiaheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at: https://github.com/NANSirun/Interpret-then-deactivate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wan, Qi Wang, Yuan Mi, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation of spatiotemporal systems governed by partial differential equations is widely applied in fields such as biology, chemistry, aerospace dynamics, and meteorology. Traditional numerical methods incur high computational costs due to the requirement of small time steps for accurate predictions. While machine learning has reduced these costs, long-term predictions remain challenged by error accumulation, particularly in scenarios with insufficient data or varying time scales, where stability and accuracy are compromised. Existing methods often neglect the effective utilization of multi-scale data, leading to suboptimal robustness in predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-scale learning framework, namely, the Physics-Informed Multi-Scale Recurrent Learning (PIMRL), to effectively leverage multi-scale data for spatiotemporal dynamics prediction. The PIMRL framework comprises two modules: the micro-scale module embeds physical knowledge into neural networks via pretraining, and the macro-scale module adopts a data-driven approach to learn the temporal evolution of physics in the latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIMRL framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets ranging from one to three dimensions, showing average improvements of over 9\% in both RMSE and MAE evaluation metrics, with maximum enhancements reaching up to 80%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Do, Binh-Son Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Score distillation sampling is an effective technique to generate 3D models from text prompts, utilizing pre-trained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models as guidance. However, the produced 3D assets tend to be over-saturating, over-smoothing, with limited diversity. These issues are results from a reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence objective, which makes the optimization unstable and results in mode-seeking behavior. In this paper, we derive a bounded score distillation objective based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which stabilizes the optimization process and produces high-quality 3D generation. JSD can match well generated and target distribution, therefore mitigating mode seeking. We provide a practical implementation of JSD by utilizing the theory of generative adversarial networks to define an approximate objective function for the generator, assuming the discriminator is well trained. By assuming the discriminator following a log-odds classifier, we propose a minority sampling algorithm to estimate the gradients of our proposed objective, providing a practical implementation for JSD. We conduct both theoretical and empirical studies to validate our method. Experimental results on T3Bench demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality and diversified 3D assets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: Accurate spinal structure measurement is crucial for assessing spine health and diagnosing conditions like spondylosis, disc herniation, and stenosis. Manual methods for measuring intervertebral disc height and spinal canal diameter are subjective and time-consuming. Automated solutions are needed to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility in clinical practice.
  Purpose: This study develops an autonomous AI system for segmenting and measuring key spinal structures in MRI scans, focusing on intervertebral disc height and spinal canal anteroposterior (AP) diameter in the cervical, lumbar, and thoracic regions. The goal is to reduce clinician workload, enhance diagnostic consistency, and improve assessments.
  Methods: The AI model leverages deep learning architectures, including UNet, nnU-Net, and CNNs. Trained on a large proprietary MRI dataset, it was validated against expert annotations. Performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients and segmentation accuracy.
  Results: The AI model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.94 for lumbar, 0.91 for cervical, and 0.90 for dorsal spine segmentation (D1-D12). It precisely measured spinal parameters like disc height and canal diameter, demonstrating robustness and clinical applicability.
  Conclusion: The AI system effectively automates MRI-based spinal measurements, improving accuracy and reducing clinician workload. Its consistent performance across spinal regions supports clinical decision-making, particularly in high-demand settings, enhancing spinal assessments and patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Hullman, Yifan Wu, Dawei Xie, Ziyang Guo, Andrew Gelman</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods to quantify uncertainty in predictions from arbitrary models are in demand in high-stakes domains like medicine and finance. Conformal prediction has emerged as a popular method for producing a set of predictions with specified average coverage, in place of a single prediction and confidence value. However, the value of conformal prediction sets to assist human decisions remains elusive due to the murky relationship between coverage guarantees and decision makers' goals and strategies. How should we think about conformal prediction sets as a form of decision support? We outline a decision theoretic framework for evaluating predictive uncertainty as informative signals, then contrast what can be said within this framework about idealized use of calibrated probabilities versus conformal prediction sets. Informed by prior empirical results and theories of human decisions under uncertainty, we formalize a set of possible strategies by which a decision maker might use a prediction set. We identify ways in which conformal prediction sets and posthoc predictive uncertainty quantification more broadly are in tension with common goals and needs in human-AI decision making. We give recommendations for future research in predictive uncertainty quantification to support human decision makers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiseong Park, Hanjin Kim, Seojin Kim, Jueun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph, is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Qian, Teck Lun Goh, Bingyu Xie, Chengyao Zhu, Biao Wan, Yawen Guan, Patrick Yin Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs), play a pivotal role in numerous clinical practices, such as diagnosing brain and cardiac arrhythmic diseases. Existing methods for biosignal classification rely on Attention-based frameworks with dense Feed Forward layers, which lead to inefficient learning, high computational overhead, and suboptimal performance. In this work, we introduce BioMamba, a Spectro-Temporal Embedding strategy applied to the Bidirectional Mamba framework with Sparse Feed Forward layers to enable effective learning of biosignal sequences. By integrating these three key components, BioMamba effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with marked improvement in classification performance. The advantages of the proposed BioMamba include (1) Reliability: BioMamba consistently delivers robust results, confirmed across six evaluation metrics. (2) Efficiency: We assess both model and training efficiency, the BioMamba demonstrates computational effectiveness by reducing model size and resource consumption compared to existing approaches. (3) Generality: With the capacity to effectively classify a diverse set of tasks, BioMamba demonstrates adaptability and effectiveness across various domains and applications.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12511">LLM-Driven Multi-step Translation from C to Rust using Static Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Zhou, Haowen Lin, Somesh Jha, Mihai Christodorescu, Kirill Levchenko, Varun Chandrasekaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating software written in legacy languages to modern languages, such as C to Rust, has significant benefits in improving memory safety while maintaining high performance. However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees as they lack the ability to capture all the semantics differences between the source and target languages. To resolve this issue, we propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust zero-shot translation tool using a two-step translation methodology: an "unidiomatic" step to translate C into Rust while preserving semantics, and an "idiomatic" step to refine the code to follow Rust's semantic standards. SACTOR utilizes information provided by static analysis of the source C program to address challenges such as pointer semantics and dependency resolution. To validate the correctness of the translated result from each step, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface to embed our translated code segment into the original code. We evaluate the translation of 200 programs from two datasets and two case studies, comparing the performance of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek-R1 in SACTOR. Our results demonstrate that SACTOR achieves high correctness and improved idiomaticity, with the best-performing model (DeepSeek-R1) reaching 93% and (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek-R1) reaching 84% correctness (on each dataset, respectively), while producing more natural and Rust-compliant translations compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Ma, Ziyang Ding, Zhicong Luo, Chi Chen, Zonghao Guo, Derek F. Wong, Xiaoyi Feng, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Human experts excel at fine-grained visual discrimination by leveraging domain knowledge to refine perceptual features, a capability that remains underdeveloped in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Song, Xiaoye Qu, Jiawei Zhou, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in combining visual comprehension with language generation. Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\textbf{DR}$) and $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12843">Towards Scalable Foundation Model for Multi-modal and Hyperspectral Geospatial Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Si, Yuxuan Wan, Minh Do, Deepak Vasisht, Han Zhao, Hendrik F. Hamann</p>
<p>Abstract: Geospatial raster data, such as that collected by satellite-based imaging systems at different times and spectral bands, hold immense potential for enabling a wide range of high-impact applications. This potential stems from the rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across multiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing self-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they fall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and computational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels and modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient Spatial-Spectral Vision Transformer with three key innovations: i) the LESS Attention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention through Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral attention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer that preserves both the continuity and physical characteristics of each spatial-spectral patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local spatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To evaluate the proposed innovations, we construct GFM-Bench, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT using a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional and channel masking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-modal geospatial foundation models while outperforming them on cross-satellite generalization tasks with higher computational efficiency. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework make it a promising direction for future geospatial data analysis tasks that involve a wide range of modalities and channels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodi Li, Shaika Chowdhury, Chung Il Wi, Maria Vassilaki, Ken Liu, Terence T Sio, Owen Garrick, Young J Juhn, James R Cerhan, Cui Tao, Nansu Zong</p>
<p>Abstract: Patient matching is the process of linking patients to appropriate clinical trials by accurately identifying and matching their medical records with trial eligibility criteria. We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets - n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022 - using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengyun Peng, Yuhang Zhou, Qiguang Chen, Jinhao Liu, Jingjing Chen, Libo Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, largely driven by well-designed prompts. However, crafting and selecting such prompts often requires considerable human effort, significantly limiting its scalability. To mitigate this, recent studies have explored automated prompt optimization as a promising solution. Despite these efforts, existing methods still face critical challenges in robustness, efficiency, and generalization. To systematically address these challenges, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the limitations of current reflection-based prompt optimization paradigm. Building on these insights, we propose 7 innovative approaches inspired by traditional deep learning paradigms for prompt optimization (DLPO), seamlessly integrating these concepts into text-based gradient optimization. Through these advancements, we progressively tackle the aforementioned challenges and validate our methods through extensive experimentation. We hope our study not only provides valuable guidance for future research but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in prompt optimization.
