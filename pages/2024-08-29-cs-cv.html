<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Li, Yulin Fu, Dongwei Yan, Sean Longyu Ma, Chiu-Wing Sham</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demands for railway transportation safety increase, traditional methods of rail track inspection no longer meet the needs of modern railway systems. To address the issues of automation and efficiency in rail fault detection, this study introduces a railway inspection system based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This edge AI system collects track images via cameras and uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to perform real-time detection of track defects and automatically reports fault information. The innovation of this system lies in its high level of automation and detection efficiency. The neural network approach employed by this system achieves a detection accuracy of 88.9%, significantly enhancing the reliability and efficiency of detection. Experimental results demonstrate that this FPGA-based system is 1.39* and 4.67* better in energy efficiency than peer implementation on the GPU and CPU platform, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghai Fang, Fangfang Zhu, Wenwen Min</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of the latest Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) technology, which allows for the mapping of gene expression within tissue sections, the integrative analysis of multiple SRT data has become increasingly important. However, batch effects between multiple slices pose significant challenges in analyzing SRT data. To address these challenges, we have developed a plug-and-play batch correction method called Global Nearest Neighbor (G2N) anchor pairs selection. G2N effectively mitigates batch effects by selecting representative anchor pairs across slices. Building upon G2N, we propose STG3Net, which cleverly combines masked graph convolutional autoencoders as backbone modules. These autoencoders, integrated with generative adversarial learning, enable STG3Net to achieve robust multi-slice spatial domain identification and batch correction. We comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of STG3Net on three multiple SRT datasets from different platforms, considering accuracy, consistency, and the F1LISI metric (a measure of batch effect correction efficiency). Compared to existing methods, STG3Net achieves the best overall performance while preserving the biological variability and connectivity between slices.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kleio Fragkedaki, Frank J. Jiang, Karl H. Johansson, Jonas M{\aa}rtensson</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a transformer-based framework for predicting future pedestrian states based on clustered historical trajectory data. In previous studies, researchers propose enhancing pedestrian trajectory predictions by using manually crafted labels to categorize pedestrian behaviors and intentions. However, these approaches often only capture a limited range of pedestrian behaviors and introduce human bias into the predictions. To alleviate the dependency on manually crafted labels, we utilize a transformer encoder coupled with hierarchical density-based clustering to automatically identify diverse behavior patterns, and use these clusters in data-driven reachability analysis. By using a transformer-based approach, we seek to enhance the representation of pedestrian trajectories and uncover characteristics or features that are subsequently used to group trajectories into different "behavior" clusters. We show that these behavior clusters can be used with data-driven reachability analysis, yielding an end-to-end data-driven approach to predicting the future motion of pedestrians. We train and evaluate our approach on a real pedestrian dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in forecasting pedestrian movements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Lin, Tonglong Wei, Zeyu Zhou, Haomin Wen, Jilin Hu, Shengnan Guo, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and powers real-world applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should transfer between different regions and tasks without retraining, thus improving computational efficiency and effectiveness with limited training data. However, a model's ability to transfer across regions is limited by the unique spatial features and POI arrangements of each region, which are closely linked to vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, achieving task transferability is challenging due to the differing generation schemes required for various tasks. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and still require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer.
  To address these challenges, we propose TrajFM, a vehicle trajectory foundation model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce STRFormer as the main learnable model within TrajFM. It integrates spatial, temporal, and POI modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in POI arrangements across regions and includes a learnable spatio-temporal Rotary position embedding module for handling spatial features. For task transferability, we propose a trajectory masking and recovery scheme. This scheme unifies the generation processes of various tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and sub-trajectories, allowing TrajFM to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Experiments on two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFM. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TrajFM-30E4.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this technical study, we introduce VFusedSeg3D, an innovative multi-modal fusion system created by the VisionRD team that combines camera and LiDAR data to significantly enhance the accuracy of 3D perception. VFusedSeg3D uses the rich semantic content of the camera pictures and the accurate depth sensing of LiDAR to generate a strong and comprehensive environmental understanding, addressing the constraints inherent in each modality. Through a carefully thought-out network architecture that aligns and merges these information at different stages, our novel feature fusion technique combines geometric features from LiDAR point clouds with semantic features from camera images. With the use of multi-modality techniques, performance has significantly improved, yielding a state-of-the-art mIoU of 72.46% on the validation set as opposed to the prior 70.51%.VFusedSeg3D sets a new benchmark in 3D segmentation accuracy. making it an ideal solution for applications requiring precise environmental perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somnuk Phon-Amnuaisuk</p>
<p>Abstract: The human mind effortlessly simulates the movements of objects governed by the laws of physics, such as a fluttering, or a waving flag under wind force, without understanding the underlying physics. This suggests that human cognition can predict the unfolding of physical events using an intuitive prediction process. This process might result from memory recall, yielding a qualitatively believable mental image, though it may not be exactly according to real-world physics. Drawing inspiration from the intriguing human ability to qualitatively visualize and describe dynamic events from past experiences without explicitly engaging in mathematical computations, this paper investigates the application of recent transformer architectures as a neuro-animator model. The visual transformer model is trained to predict flag motions at the \emph{t+1} time step, given information of previous motions from \emph{t-n} $\cdots$ \emph{t} time steps. The results show that the visual transformer-based architecture successfully learns temporal embedding of flag motions and produces reasonable quality simulations of flag waving under different wind forces.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15263">S4DL: Shift-sensitive Spatial-Spectral Disentangling Learning for Hyperspectral Image Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Feng, Tianshu Zhang, Junpeng Zhang, Ronghua Shang, Weisheng Dong, Guangming Shi, Licheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, extensively studied in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, aim to use labeled source domain data and unlabeled target domain data to learn domain invariant features for cross-scene classification. Compared to natural images, numerous spectral bands of HSIs provide abundant semantic information, but they also increase the domain shift significantly. In most existing methods, both explicit alignment and implicit alignment simply align feature distribution, ignoring domain information in the spectrum. We noted that when the spectral channel between source and target domains is distinguished obviously, the transfer performance of these methods tends to deteriorate. Additionally, their performance fluctuates greatly owing to the varying domain shifts across various datasets. To address these problems, a novel shift-sensitive spatial-spectral disentangling learning (S4DL) approach is proposed. In S4DL, gradient-guided spatial-spectral decomposition is designed to separate domain-specific and domain-invariant representations by generating tailored masks under the guidance of the gradient from domain classification. A shift-sensitive adaptive monitor is defined to adjust the intensity of disentangling according to the magnitude of domain shift. Furthermore, a reversible neural network is constructed to retain domain information that lies in not only in semantic but also the shallow-level detailed information. Extensive experimental results on several cross-scene HSI datasets consistently verified that S4DL is better than the state-of-the-art UDA methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinhuai Wang, Qihan Zhao, Runyi Yu, Ailing Zeng, Jing Lin, Zhengyi Luo, Hok Wai Tsui, Jiwen Yu, Xiu Li, Qifeng Chen, Jian Zhang, Lei Zhang, Ping Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Mastering basketball skills such as diverse layups and dribbling involves complex interactions with the ball and requires real-time adjustments. Traditional reinforcement learning methods for interaction skills rely on labor-intensive, manually designed rewards that do not generalize well across different skills. Inspired by how humans learn from demonstrations, we propose SkillMimic, a data-driven approach that mimics both human and ball motions to learn a wide variety of basketball skills. SkillMimic employs a unified configuration to learn diverse skills from human-ball motion datasets, with skill diversity and generalization improving as the dataset grows. This approach allows training a single policy to learn multiple skills, enabling smooth skill switching even if these switches are not present in the reference dataset. The skills acquired by SkillMimic can be easily reused by a high-level controller to accomplish complex basketball tasks. To evaluate our approach, we introduce two basketball datasets: one estimated through monocular RGB videos and the other using advanced motion capture equipment, collectively containing about 35 minutes of diverse basketball skills. Experiments show that our method can effectively learn various basketball skills included in the dataset with a unified configuration, including various styles of dribbling, layups, and shooting. Furthermore, by training a high-level controller to reuse the acquired skills, we can achieve complex basketball tasks such as layup scoring, which involves dribbling toward the basket, timing the dribble and layup to score, retrieving the rebound, and repeating the process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohua Huang, Jinke Xu, Wenming Zheng, Qirong Mao, Abhinav Dhall</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, group-level emotion recognition (GER) has emerged as an important area in analyzing human behavior. Early GER methods are primarily relied on handcrafted features. However, with the proliferation of Deep Learning (DL) techniques and their remarkable success in diverse tasks, neural networks have garnered increasing interest in GER. Unlike individual's emotion, group emotions exhibit diversity and dynamics. Presently, several DL approaches have been proposed to effectively leverage the rich information inherent in group-level image and enhance GER performance significantly. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of DL techniques applied to GER, proposing a new taxonomy for the field cover all aspects of GER based on DL. The survey overviews datasets, the deep GER pipeline, and performance comparisons of the state-of-the-art methods past decade. Moreover, it summarizes and discuss the fundamental approaches and advanced developments for each aspect. Furthermore, we identify outstanding challenges and suggest potential avenues for the design of robust GER systems. To the best of our knowledge, thus survey represents the first comprehensive review of deep GER methods, serving as a pivotal references for future GER research endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Niu, Christopher Wiedeman, Mengzhou Li, Jonathan S Maltz, Ge Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to improve photon counting CT (PCCT) image resolution using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). Although DDPMs have shown superior performance when applied to various computer vision tasks, their effectiveness has yet to be translated to high dimensional CT super-resolution. To train DDPMs in a conditional sampling manner, we first leverage CatSim to simulate realistic lower resolution PCCT images from high-resolution CT scans. Since maximizing DDPM performance is time-consuming for both inference and training, especially on high-dimensional PCCT data, we explore both 2D and 3D networks for conditional DDPM and apply methods to accelerate training. In particular, we decompose the 3D task into efficient 2D DDPMs and design a joint 2D inference in the reverse diffusion process that synergizes 2D results of all three dimensions to make the final 3D prediction. Experimental results show that our DDPM achieves improved results versus baseline reference models in recovering high-frequency structures, suggesting that a framework based on realistic simulation and DDPM shows promise for improving PCCT resolution.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15373">Handling Geometric Domain Shifts in Semantic Segmentation of Surgical RGB and Hyperspectral Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Silvia Seidlitz, Jan Sellner, Alexander Studier-Fischer, Alessandro Motta, Berkin \"Ozdemir, Beat P. M\"uller-Stich, Felix Nickel, Lena Maier-Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust semantic segmentation of intraoperative image data holds promise for enabling automatic surgical scene understanding and autonomous robotic surgery. While model development and validation are primarily conducted on idealistic scenes, geometric domain shifts, such as occlusions of the situs, are common in real-world open surgeries. To close this gap, we (1) present the first analysis of state-of-the-art (SOA) semantic segmentation models when faced with geometric out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and (2) propose an augmentation technique called "Organ Transplantation", to enhance generalizability. Our comprehensive validation on six different OOD datasets, comprising 600 RGB and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cubes from 33 pigs, each annotated with 19 classes, reveals a large performance drop in SOA organ segmentation models on geometric OOD data. This performance decline is observed not only in conventional RGB data (with a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) drop of 46 %) but also in HSI data (with a DSC drop of 45 %), despite the richer spectral information content. The performance decline increases with the spatial granularity of the input data. Our augmentation technique improves SOA model performance by up to 67 % for RGB data and 90 % for HSI data, achieving performance at the level of in-distribution performance on real OOD test data. Given the simplicity and effectiveness of our augmentation method, it is a valuable tool for addressing geometric domain shifts in surgical scene segmentation, regardless of the underlying model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcelo dos Santos, Rayson Laroca, Rafael O. Ribeiro, Jo\~ao C. Neves, David Menotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution algorithms often struggle with images from surveillance environments due to adverse conditions such as unknown degradation, variations in pose, irregular illumination, and occlusions. However, acquiring multiple images, even of low quality, is possible with surveillance cameras. In this work, we develop an algorithm based on diffusion models that utilize a low-resolution image combined with features extracted from multiple low-quality images to generate a super-resolved image while minimizing distortions in the individual's identity. Unlike other algorithms, our approach recovers facial features without explicitly providing attribute information or without the need to calculate a gradient of a function during the reconstruction process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time multi-features combined with low-resolution images are used as conditioners to generate more reliable super-resolution images using stochastic differential equations. The FFHQ dataset was employed for training, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in facial recognition and verification metrics when evaluated on the CelebA and Quis-Campi datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deyuan Qu, Qi Chen, Yongqi Zhu, Yihao Zhu, Sergei S. Avedisov, Song Fu, Qing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In cooperative perception studies, there is often a trade-off between communication bandwidth and perception performance. While current feature fusion solutions are known for their excellent object detection performance, transmitting the entire sets of intermediate feature maps requires substantial bandwidth. Furthermore, these fusion approaches are typically limited to vehicles that use identical detection models. Our goal is to develop a solution that supports cooperative perception across vehicles equipped with different modalities of sensors. This method aims to deliver improved perception performance compared to late fusion techniques, while achieving precision similar to the state-of-art intermediate fusion, but requires an order of magnitude less bandwidth. We propose HEAD, a method that fuses features from the classification and regression heads in 3D object detection networks. Our method is compatible with heterogeneous detection networks such as LiDAR PointPillars, SECOND, VoxelNet, and camera Bird's-eye View (BEV) Encoder. Given the naturally smaller feature size in the detection heads, we design a self-attention mechanism to fuse the classification head and a complementary feature fusion layer to fuse the regression head. Our experiments, comprehensively evaluated on the V2V4Real and OPV2V datasets, demonstrate that HEAD is a fusion method that effectively balances communication bandwidth and perception performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomoya Nitta, Takumi Fukuzawa, Toru Tamaki</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for video captioning that controls the length of generated captions. Previous work on length control often had few levels for expressing length. In this study, we propose two methods of length embedding for fine-grained length control. A traditional embedding method is linear, using a one-hot vector and an embedding matrix. In this study, we propose methods that represent length in multi-hot vectors. One is bit embedding that expresses length in bit representation, and the other is ordinal embedding that uses the binary representation often used in ordinal regression. These length representations of multi-hot vectors are converted into length embedding by a nonlinear MLP. This method allows for not only the length control of caption sentences but also the control of the time when reading the caption. Experiments using ActivityNet Captions and Spoken Moments in Time show that the proposed method effectively controls the length of the generated captions. Analysis of the embedding vectors with ICA shows that length and semantics were learned separately, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed embedding methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhuo Zhang, Bin Zhu, Yu Cao, Yanbin Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable advancements in recent years, aiming to produce realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with generating anatomically accurate representations of human hands. The resulting images frequently exhibit issues such as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of fingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent complexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual descriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the generation of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000 training samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with the first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by using a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture representation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by incorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment between the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage utilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly available dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation. Based on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image captioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions enriched with detailed gesture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hand1000 significantly outperforms existing models in producing anatomically correct hand images while faithfully representing other details in the text, such as faces, clothing, and colors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harbir Antil, Daniel Blauvelt, David Sayre</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike traditional cameras which synchronously register pixel intensity, neuromorphic sensors only register `changes' at pixels where a change is occurring asynchronously. This enables neuromorphic sensors to sample at a micro-second level and efficiently capture the dynamics. Since, only sequences of asynchronous event changes are recorded rather than brightness intensities over time, many traditional image processing techniques cannot be directly applied. Furthermore, existing approaches, including the ones recently introduced by the authors, use traditional images combined with neuromorphic event data to carry out reconstructions. The aim of this work is introduce an optimization based approach to reconstruct images and dynamics only from the neuromoprhic event data without any additional knowledge of the events. Each pixel is modeled temporally. The experimental results on real data highlight the efficacy of the presented approach, paving the way for efficient and accurate processing of neuromorphic sensor data in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Lin, Yongtao Wang, Jinhe Zhang, Xiaojie Chu, Haibin Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have gained extensive attention for their superior inferencing efficiency and compression ratio compared to traditional full-precision networks. However, due to the unique characteristics of BNNs, designing a powerful binary architecture is challenging and often requires significant manpower. A promising solution is to utilize Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to assist in designing BNNs, but current NAS methods for BNNs are relatively straightforward and leave a performance gap between the searched models and manually designed ones. To address this gap, we propose a novel neural architecture search scheme for binary neural networks, named NAS-BNN. We first carefully design a search space based on the unique characteristics of BNNs. Then, we present three training strategies, which significantly enhance the training of supernet and boost the performance of all subnets. Our discovered binary model family outperforms previous BNNs for a wide range of operations (OPs) from 20M to 200M. For instance, we achieve 68.20% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 57M OPs. In addition, we validate the transferability of these searched BNNs on the object detection task, and our binary detectors with the searched BNNs achieve a novel state-of-the-art result, e.g., 31.6% mAP with 370M OPs, on MS COCO dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisheng Su, Feixiang Song, Cong Ma, Panpan Cai, Wei Wu, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust object detection and tracking under arbitrary sight of view is challenging yet essential for the development of Autonomous Vehicle technology. With the growing demand of unmanned function vehicles, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of low-speed autonomous driving. Due to the complexity of driving conditions and diversity of near obstacles such as blind spots and high occlusion, the perception capability of near-field environment is still inferior than its farther counterpart. To further enhance the intelligent ability of unmanned vehicles, in this paper, we construct a multimodal data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view for ego vehicle, either global view or local view. Meanwhile, a large-scale multi-sensor dataset is built, named RoboSense, to facilitate near-field scene understanding. RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of near-field obstacles within 5$m$ as the previous single-vehicle datasets such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future development of related research, where the detailed data analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangpeng Shu, Jiawei Zhang, Reachsak Ly, Fangzheng Lin, Yuanfeng Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-damage is common in reinforced concrete structures and leads to the requirement of large number of neural networks, parameters and data storage, if convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for damage recognition. In addition, conventional CNN experiences catastrophic forgetting and training inefficiency as the number of tasks increases during continual learning, leading to large accuracy decrease of previous learned tasks. To address these problems, this study proposes a continuallearning-based damage recognition model (CLDRM) which integrates the learning without forgetting continual learning method into the ResNet-34 architecture for the recognition of damages in RC structures as well as relevant structural components. Three experiments for four recognition tasks were designed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CLDRM framework. In this way, it reduces both the prediction time and data storage by about 75% in four tasks of continuous learning. Three experiments for four recognition tasks were designed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CLDRM framework. By gradual feature fusion, CLDRM outperformed other methods by managed to achieve high accuracy in the damage recognition and classification. As the number of recognition tasks increased, CLDRM also experienced smaller decrease of the previous learned tasks. Results indicate that the CLDRM framework successfully performs damage recognition and classification with reasonable accuracy and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik K. Mishra, Irene Ballester, Andrea Iaboni, Bing Ye, Kristine Newman, Alex Mihailidis, Shehroz S. Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: The behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as agitation and aggression, present a significant health and safety risk in residential care settings. Many care facilities have video cameras in place for digital monitoring of public spaces, which can be leveraged to develop an automated behaviours of risk detection system that can alert the staff to enable timely intervention and prevent the situation from escalating. However, one of the challenges in our previous study was the presence of false alarms due to obstruction of view by activities happening close to the camera. To address this issue, we proposed a novel depth-weighted loss function to train a customized convolutional autoencoder to enforce equivalent importance to the events happening both near and far from the cameras; thus, helping to reduce false alarms and making the method more suitable for real-world deployment. The proposed method was trained using data from nine participants with dementia across three cameras situated in a specialized dementia unit and achieved an area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic of $0.852$, $0.81$ and $0.768$ for the three cameras. Ablation analysis was conducted for the individual components of the proposed method and the performance of the proposed method was investigated for participant-specific and sex-specific behaviours of risk detection. The proposed method performed reasonably well in detecting behaviours of risk in people with dementia motivating further research toward the development of a behaviours of risk detection system suitable for deployment in video surveillance systems in care facilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghoon Yu, Ilchae Jung, Byeongju Han, Taeoh Kim, Yunho Kim, Dongyoon Wee, Jeany Son</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring image segmentation (RIS) requires dense vision-language interactions between visual pixels and textual words to segment objects based on a given description. However, commonly adapted dual-encoders in RIS, e.g., Swin transformer and BERT (uni-modal encoders) or CLIP (a multi-modal dual-encoder), lack dense multi-modal interactions during pre-training, leading to a gap with a pixel-level RIS task. To bridge this gap, existing RIS methods often rely on multi-modal fusion modules that interact two encoders, but this approach leads to high computational costs. In this paper, we present a novel RIS method with a single-encoder, i.e., BEiT-3, maximizing the potential of shared self-attention across all framework components. This enables seamless interactions of two modalities from input to final prediction, producing granularly aligned multi-modal features. Furthermore, we propose lightweight yet effective decoder modules, a Shared FPN and a Shared Mask Decoder, which contribute to the high efficiency of our model. Our simple baseline with a single encoder achieves outstanding performances on the RIS benchmark datasets while maintaining computational efficiency, compared to the most recent SoTA methods based on dual-encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihong Yin, Yunlu Chen, Sezer Karaoglu, Theo Gevers</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods in neural scene reconstruction utilize the Signed Distance Function (SDF) to model the density function. However, in indoor scenes, the density computed from the SDF for a sampled point may not consistently reflect its real importance in volume rendering, often due to the influence of neighboring objects. To tackle this issue, our work proposes a novel approach for indoor scene reconstruction, which instead parameterizes the density function with the Signed Ray Distance Function (SRDF). Firstly, the SRDF is predicted by the network and transformed to a ray-conditioned density function for volume rendering. We argue that the ray-specific SRDF only considers the surface along the camera ray, from which the derived density function is more consistent to the real occupancy than that from the SDF. Secondly, although SRDF and SDF represent different aspects of scene geometries, their values should share the same sign indicating the underlying spatial occupancy. Therefore, this work introduces a SRDF-SDF consistency loss to constrain the signs of the SRDF and SDF outputs. Thirdly, this work proposes a self-supervised visibility task, introducing the physical visibility geometry to the reconstruction task. The visibility task combines prior from predicted SRDF and SDF as pseudo labels, and contributes to generating more accurate 3D geometry. Our method implemented with different representations has been validated on indoor datasets, achieving improved performance in both reconstruction and view synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Liu, Yibing Wang, Hanghang Ma, Xiaoping Wu, Xiaoqi Ma, Xiaoming Wei, Jianbin Jiao, Enhua Wu, Jie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements have been made in extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). However, extending input modality of LLMs to video data remains a challenging endeavor, especially for long videos. Due to insufficient access to large-scale high-quality video data and the excessive compression of visual features, current methods exhibit limitations in effectively processing long videos. In this paper, we introduce Kangaroo, a powerful Video LMM aimed at addressing these challenges. Confronted with issue of inadequate training data, we develop a data curation system to build a large-scale dataset with high-quality annotations for vision-language pre-training and instruction tuning. In addition, we design a curriculum training pipeline with gradually increasing resolution and number of input frames to accommodate long videos. Evaluation results demonstrate that, with 8B parameters, Kangaroo achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of video understanding benchmarks while exhibiting competitive results on others. Particularly, on benchmarks specialized for long videos, Kangaroo excels some larger models with over 10B parameters and proprietary models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15548">ConsistencyTrack: A Robust Multi-Object Tracker with a Generation Strategy of Consistency Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lifan Jiang, Zhihui Wang, Siqi Yin, Guangxiao Ma, Peng Zhang, Boxi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical technology in computer vision, designed to detect multiple targets in video sequences and assign each target a unique ID per frame. Existed MOT methods excel at accurately tracking multiple objects in real-time across various scenarios. However, these methods still face challenges such as poor noise resistance and frequent ID switches. In this research, we propose a novel ConsistencyTrack, joint detection and tracking(JDT) framework that formulates detection and association as a denoising diffusion process on perturbed bounding boxes. This progressive denoising strategy significantly improves the model's noise resistance. During the training phase, paired object boxes within two adjacent frames are diffused from ground-truth boxes to a random distribution, and then the model learns to detect and track by reversing this process. In inference, the model refines randomly generated boxes into detection and tracking results through minimal denoising steps. ConsistencyTrack also introduces an innovative target association strategy to address target occlusion. Experiments on the MOT17 and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate that ConsistencyTrack outperforms other compared methods, especially better than DiffusionTrack in inference speed and other performance metrics.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15556">Divide, Conquer and Combine: A Training-Free Framework for High-Resolution Image Perception in Multimodal Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Wang, Liang Ding, Minyan Zeng, Xiabin Zhou, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have experienced significant advancements recently, but still struggle to recognize and interpret intricate details in high-resolution (HR) images effectively. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs claim to process images at 4K resolution, existing MLLM benchmarks only support up to 2K, leaving the capabilities of SOTA models on true HR images largely untested. Furthermore, existing methods for enhancing HR image perception in MLLMs rely on computationally expensive visual instruction tuning. To address these limitations, we introduce HR-Bench, the first deliberately designed benchmark to rigorously evaluate MLLM performance on 4K&8K images. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that while downsampling HR images leads to vision information loss, leveraging complementary modalities, e.g., text, can effectively compensate for this loss. Building upon this insight, we propose Divide, Conquer and Combine (DC$^2$), a novel training-free framework for enhancing MLLM perception of HR images. DC$^2$ follows a three-staged approach: 1) Divide: recursively partitioning the HR image into patches and merging similar patches to minimize computational overhead, 2) Conquer: leveraging the MLLM to generate accurate textual descriptions for each image patch, and 3) Combine: utilizing the generated text descriptions to enhance the MLLM's understanding of the overall HR image. Extensive experiments show that: 1) the SOTA MLLM achieves 63% accuracy, which is markedly lower than the 87% accuracy achieved by humans on HR-Bench; 2) our DC$^2$ brings consistent and significant improvements (a relative increase of +6% on HR-Bench and +8% on general multimodal benchmarks). The benchmark and code will be released to facilitate the multimodal R&D community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Korevaar, Ruwan Tennakoon, Alireza Bab-Hadiashar</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of medical imaging, the U-Net architecture, along with its variants, has established itself as a cornerstone for image segmentation tasks, particularly due to its strong performance when trained on limited datasets. Despite its impressive performance on identically distributed (in-domain) data, U-Nets exhibit a significant decline in performance when tested on data that deviates from the training distribution, out-of-distribution (out-of-domain) data. Current methodologies predominantly address this issue by employing generalization techniques that hinge on various forms of regularization, which have demonstrated moderate success in specific scenarios. This paper, however, ventures into uncharted territory by investigating the implications of utilizing models that are smaller by three orders of magnitude (i.e., x1000) compared to a conventional U-Net. A reduction of this size in U-net parameters typically adversely affects both in-domain and out-of-domain performance, possibly due to a significantly reduced receptive field. To circumvent this issue, we explore the concept of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), which, despite its simpler model structure, can attain larger receptive fields through recursive processes. Experimental results on two distinct datasets reveal that NCA outperforms traditional methods in terms of generalization, while still maintaining a commendable IID performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinglun Li, Xinyu Zhou, Kaixun Jiang, Lingyi Hong, Pinxue Guo, Zhaoyu Chen, Weifeng Ge, Wenqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal fusion, leveraging data like vision and language, is rapidly gaining traction. This enriched data representation improves performance across various tasks. Existing methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a critical area where AI models encounter unseen data in real-world scenarios, rely heavily on whole-image features. These image-level features can include irrelevant information that hinders the detection of OOD samples, ultimately limiting overall performance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TagOOD}, a novel approach for OOD detection that leverages vision-language representations to achieve label-free object feature decoupling from whole images. This decomposition enables a more focused analysis of object semantics, enhancing OOD detection performance. Subsequently, TagOOD trains a lightweight network on the extracted object features to learn representative class centers. These centers capture the central tendencies of IND object classes, minimizing the influence of irrelevant image features during OOD detection. Finally, our approach efficiently detects OOD samples by calculating distance-based metrics as OOD scores between learned centers and test samples. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TagOOD on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing OOD detection methods. This work presents a novel perspective for further exploration of multimodal information utilization in OOD detection, with potential applications across various tasks.</p>

By expanding to sequential image fine-grained localization, our model, equipped with a novel Temporal Attention Module (TAM), leverages contextual information to significantly improve sequential image localization accuracy. Our method shows substantial reductions in both mean and median localization errors on the Cross-View Image Sequence (CVIS) dataset, outperforming current state-of-the-art single-image localization techniques. Additionally, by adapting the KITTI-CVL dataset into sequential image sets, we not only offer a more realistic dataset for future research but also demonstrate our model's robust generalization capabilities across varying times and areas, evidenced by a 75.3% reduction in mean distance error in cross-view sequential image localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinglun Li, Xinyu Zhou, Pinxue Guo, Yixuan Sun, Yiwen Huang, Weifeng Ge, Wenqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution inputs for visual recognition models has become critical in safe deep learning. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical visual category modeling scheme to separate out-of-distribution data from in-distribution data through joint representation learning and statistical modeling. We learn a mixture of Gaussian models for each in-distribution category. There are many Gaussian mixture models to model different visual categories. With these Gaussian models, we design an in-distribution score function by aggregating multiple Mahalanobis-based metrics. We don't use any auxiliary outlier data as training samples, which may hurt the generalization ability of out-of-distribution detection algorithms. We split the ImageNet-1k dataset into ten folds randomly. We use one fold as the in-distribution dataset and the others as out-of-distribution datasets to evaluate the proposed method. We also conduct experiments on seven popular benchmarks, including CIFAR, iNaturalist, SUN, Places, Textures, ImageNet-O, and OpenImage-O. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms clearly. Meanwhile, we find that our visual representation has a competitive performance when compared with features learned by classical methods. These results demonstrate that the proposed method hasn't weakened the discriminative ability of visual recognition models and keeps high efficiency in detecting out-of-distribution samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihong Yin, Sezer Karaoglu, Theo Gevers</p>
<p>Abstract: In addition to color and textural information, geometry provides important cues for 3D scene reconstruction. However, current reconstruction methods only include geometry at the feature level thus not fully exploiting the geometric information.
  In contrast, this paper proposes a novel geometry integration mechanism for 3D scene reconstruction. Our approach incorporates 3D geometry at three levels, i.e. feature learning, feature fusion, and network supervision. First, geometry-guided feature learning encodes geometric priors to contain view-dependent information. Second, a geometry-guided adaptive feature fusion is introduced which utilizes the geometric priors as a guidance to adaptively generate weights for multiple views. Third, at the supervision level, taking the consistency between 2D and 3D normals into account, a consistent 3D normal loss is designed to add local constraints.
  Large-scale experiments are conducted on the ScanNet dataset, showing that volumetric methods with our geometry integration mechanism outperform state-of-the-art methods quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Volumetric methods with ours also show good generalization on the 7-Scenes and TUM RGB-D datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bianca Lamm, Janis Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: Most production-level deployments for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks are still build as processing pipelines of independent steps including image pre-processing, object- and text detection, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and (mostly supervised) object classification. However, the recent advances in vision Foundation Models [25] and Vision Language Models (VLMs) [23] raise the question if these custom trained, multi-step approaches can be replaced with pre-trained, single-step VLMs. This paper analyzes the performance and limits of various VLMs in the context of VQA and OCR [5, 9, 12] tasks in a production-level scenario. Using data from the Retail-786k [10] dataset, we investigate the capabilities of pre-trained VLMs to answer detailed questions about advertised products in images. Our study includes two commercial models, GPT-4V [16] and GPT-4o [17], as well as four open-source models: InternVL [5], LLaVA 1.5 [12], LLaVA-NeXT [13], and CogAgent [9]. Our initial results show, that there is in general no big performance gap between open-source and commercial models. However, we observe a strong task dependent variance in VLM performance: while most models are able to answer questions regarding the product brand and price with high accuracy, they completely fail at the same time to correctly identity the specific product name or discount. This indicates the problem of VLMs to solve fine-grained classification tasks as well to model the more abstract concept of discounts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanglin Deng, Tianyang Xu, Chunyang Cheng, Xiao-Jun Wu, Josef Kittler</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Multi-Modality Image Fusion (MMIF) has been applied to many fields, which has attracted many scholars to endeavour to improve the fusion performance. However, the prevailing focus has predominantly been on the architecture design, rather than the training strategies. As a low-level vision task, image fusion is supposed to quickly deliver output images for observation and supporting downstream tasks. Thus, superfluous computational and storage overheads should be avoided. In this work, a lightweight Distilled Mini-Model with a Dynamic Refresh strategy (MMDRFuse) is proposed to achieve this objective. To pursue model parsimony, an extremely small convolutional network with a total of 113 trainable parameters (0.44 KB) is obtained by three carefully designed supervisions. First, digestible distillation is constructed by emphasising external spatial feature consistency, delivering soft supervision with balanced details and saliency for the target network. Second, we develop a comprehensive loss to balance the pixel, gradient, and perception clues from the source images. Third, an innovative dynamic refresh training strategy is used to collaborate history parameters and current supervision during training, together with an adaptive adjust function to optimise the fusion network. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits promising advantages in terms of model efficiency and complexity, with superior performance in multiple image fusion tasks and downstream pedestrian detection application.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucrezia Tosato, Sylvain Lobry, Flora Weissgerber, Laurent Wendling</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing visual question answering (RSVQA) has been involved in several research in recent years, leading to an increase in new methods. RSVQA automatically extracts information from satellite images, so far only optical, and a question to automatically search for the answer in the image and provide it in a textual form. In our research, we study whether Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can be beneficial to this field. We divide our study into three phases which include classification methods and VQA. In the first one, we explore the classification results of SAR alone and investigate the best method to extract information from SAR data. Then, we study the combination of SAR and optical data. In the last phase, we investigate how SAR images and a combination of different modalities behave in RSVQA compared to a method only using optical images. We conclude that adding the SAR modality leads to improved performances, although further research on using SAR data to automatically answer questions is needed as well as more balanced datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoxuan Wang, Xu Han, Hongxin Liu, Xianzhi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rotation robustness property has drawn much attention to point cloud analysis, whereas it still poses a critical challenge in 3D object detection. When subjected to arbitrary rotation, most existing detectors fail to produce expected outputs due to the poor rotation robustness. In this paper, we present RIDE, a pioneering exploration of Rotation-Invariance for the 3D LiDAR-point-based object DEtector, with the key idea of designing rotation-invariant features from LiDAR scenes and then effectively incorporating them into existing 3D detectors. Specifically, we design a bi-feature extractor that extracts (i) object-aware features though sensitive to rotation but preserve geometry well, and (ii) rotation-invariant features, which lose geometric information to a certain extent but are robust to rotation. These two kinds of features complement each other to decode 3D proposals that are robust to arbitrary rotations. Particularly, our RIDE is compatible and easy to plug into the existing one-stage and two-stage 3D detectors, and boosts both detection performance and rotation robustness. Extensive experiments on the standard benchmarks showcase that the mean average precision (mAP) and rotation robustness can be significantly boosted by integrating with our RIDE, with +5.6% mAP and 53% rotation robustness improvement on KITTI, +5.1% and 28% improvement correspondingly on nuScenes. The code will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Quattrini, Carmine Zaccagnino, Silvia Cascianelli, Laura Righi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Regesta are catalogs of summaries of other documents and, in some cases, are the only source of information about the content of such full-length documents. For this reason, they are of great interest to scholars in many social and humanities fields. In this work, we focus on Regesta Pontificum Romanum, a large collection of papal registers. Regesta are visually rich documents, where the layout is as important as the text content to convey the contained information through the structure, and are inherently multi-page documents. Among Digital Humanities techniques that can help scholars efficiently exploit regesta and other documental sources in the form of scanned documents, Document Parsing has emerged as a task to process document images and convert them into machine-readable structured representations, usually markup language. However, current models focus on scientific and business documents, and most of them consider only single-paged documents. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we propose {\mu}gat, an extension of the recently proposed Document parsing Nougat architecture, which can handle elements spanning over the single page limits. Specifically, we adapt Nougat to process a larger, multi-page context, consisting of the previous and the following page, while parsing the current page. Experimental results, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach also in the case of the challenging Regesta Pontificum Romanorum.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15647">Leveraging Persistent Homology for Differential Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ninad Aithal, Debanjali Bhattacharya, Neelam Sinha, Thomas Gregor Issac</p>
<p>Abstract: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by subtle changes in cognitive functions, often associated with disruptions in brain connectivity. The present study introduces a novel fine-grained analysis to examine topological alterations in neurodegeneration pertaining to six different brain networks of MCI subjects (Early/Late MCI). To achieve this, fMRI time series from two distinct populations are investigated: (i) the publicly accessible ADNI dataset and (ii) our in-house dataset. The study utilizes sliding window embedding to convert each fMRI time series into a sequence of 3-dimensional vectors, facilitating the assessment of changes in regional brain topology. Distinct persistence diagrams are computed for Betti descriptors of dimension-0, 1, and 2. Wasserstein distance metric is used to quantify differences in topological characteristics. We have examined both (i) ROI-specific inter-subject interactions and (ii) subject-specific inter-ROI interactions. Further, a new deep learning model is proposed for classification, achieving a maximum classification accuracy of 95% for the ADNI dataset and 85% for the in-house dataset. This methodology is further adapted for the differential diagnosis of MCI sub-types, resulting in a peak accuracy of 76.5%, 91.1% and 80% in classifying HC Vs. EMCI, HC Vs. LMCI and EMCI Vs. LMCI, respectively. We showed that the proposed approach surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques designed for classifying MCI and its sub-types using fMRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael G. DeMoor, John J. Prevost</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) loss functions traditionally aim to control the forces of separability and compactness within an embedding space so that the same class data points are pulled together and different class ones are pushed apart. Within the context of DML, a softmax operation will typically normalize distances into a probability for optimization, thus coupling all the push/pull forces together. This paper proposes a potential new class of loss functions that operate within a euclidean domain and aim to take full advantage of the coupled forces governing embedding space formation under a softmax. These forces of compactness and separability can be boosted or mitigated within controlled locations at will by using a warping function. In this work, we provide a simple example of a warping function and use it to achieve competitive, state-of-the-art results on various metric learning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbao Zhou, Jilin Mei, Pengze Wu, Liang Chen, Fangzhou Zhao, Xijun Zhao, Yu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, 3D LiDAR plays a crucial role in understanding the vehicle's surroundings. However, the newly emerged, unannotated objects presents few-shot learning problem for semantic segmentation. This paper addresses the limitations of current few-shot semantic segmentation by exploiting the temporal continuity of LiDAR data. Employing a tracking model to generate pseudo-ground-truths from a sequence of LiDAR frames, our method significantly augments the dataset, enhancing the model's ability to learn on novel classes. However, this approach introduces a data imbalance biased to novel data that presents a new challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this, we incorporate LoRA, a technique that reduces the number of trainable parameters, thereby preserving the model's performance on base classes while improving its adaptability to novel classes. This work represents a significant step forward in few-shot 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation for autonomous driving. Our code is available at https://github.com/junbao-zhou/Track-no-forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Quattrini, Vittorio Pippi, Silvia Cascianelli, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become the State-of-the-Art for text-to-image generation, and increasing research effort has been dedicated to adapting the inference process of pretrained diffusion models to achieve zero-shot capabilities. An example is the generation of panorama images, which has been tackled in recent works by combining independent diffusion paths over overlapping latent features, which is referred to as joint diffusion, obtaining perceptually aligned panoramas. However, these methods often yield semantically incoherent outputs and trade-off diversity for uniformity. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Merge-Attend-Diffuse operator, which can be plugged into different types of pretrained diffusion models used in a joint diffusion setting to improve the perceptual and semantical coherence of the generated panorama images. Specifically, we merge the diffusion paths, reprogramming self- and cross-attention to operate on the aggregated latent space. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental analysis, together with a user study, demonstrate that our method maintains compatibility with the input prompt and visual quality of the generated images while increasing their semantic coherence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Wang, Zhaoyang Bu, Jiaxuan Mao, Wenyu Zhu, Jingya Zhao, Wei Du, Guochao Shi, Min Zhou, Si Chen, Jieming Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have sparked performance boosts in various real-world applications including disease diagnosis based on multi-modal medical data. Cough sound data-based respiratory disease (e.g., COVID-19 and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) diagnosis has also attracted much attention. However, existing works usually utilise traditional machine learning or deep models of moderate scales. On the other hand, the developed approaches are trained and evaluated on small-scale data due to the difficulty of curating and annotating clinical data on scale. To address these issues in prior works, we create a unified framework to evaluate various deep models from lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g., ResNet18) to modern vision transformers and compare their performance in respiratory disease classification. Based on the observations from such an extensive empirical study, we propose a novel approach to cough-based disease classification based on both self-supervised and supervised learning on a large-scale cough data set. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed approach outperforms prior arts consistently on two benchmark datasets for COVID-19 diagnosis and a proprietary dataset for COPD/non-COPD classification with an AUROC of 92.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Mestre-Quereda, Juan M. Lopez-Sanchez</p>
<p>Abstract: Speckle suppression in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a key processing step which continues to be a research topic. A wide variety of methods, using either spatially-based approaches or transform-based strategies, have been developed and have shown to provide outstanding results. However, recent advances in deep learning techniques and their application to SAR image despeckling have been demonstrated to offer state-of-the-art results. Unfortunately, they have been mostly applied to single-polarimetric images. The extension of a deep learning-based approach for speckle removal to polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images is complicated because of the complex nature of the measured covariance matrices for every image pixel, the properties of which must be preserved during filtering. In this work, we propose a complete framework to remove speckle in polarimetric SAR images using a convolutional neural network. The methodology includes a reversible transformation of the original complex covariance matrix to obtain a set of real-valued intensity bands which are fed to the neural network. In addition, the proposed method includes a change detection strategy to avoid the neural network to learn erroneous features in areas strongly affected by temporal changes, so that the network only learns the underlying speckle component present in the data. The method is implemented and tested with dual-polarimetric images acquired by Sentinel-1. Experiments show that the proposed approach offers exceptional results in both speckle reduction and resolution preservation. More importantly, it is also shown that the neural network is not generating artifacts or introducing bias in the filtered images, making them suitable for further polarimetric processing and exploitation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting actions in videos, particularly within cluttered scenes, poses significant challenges due to the limitations of 2D frame analysis from a camera perspective. Unlike human vision, which benefits from 3D understanding, recognizing actions in such environments can be difficult. This research introduces a novel approach integrating 3D features and depth maps alongside RGB features to enhance action recognition accuracy. Our method involves processing estimated depth maps through a separate branch from the RGB feature encoder and fusing the features to understand the scene and actions comprehensively. Using the Side4Video framework and VideoMamba, which employ CLIP and VisionMamba for spatial feature extraction, our approach outperformed our implementation of the Side4Video network on the Something-Something V2 dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Tandon, Geetanjali Sharma, Gaurav Jaswal, Aditya Nigam, Raghavendra Ramachandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have emphasized the potential of forehead-crease patterns as an alternative for face, iris, and periocular recognition, presenting contactless and convenient solutions, particularly in situations where faces are covered by surgical masks. However, collecting forehead data presents challenges, including cost and time constraints, as developing and optimizing forehead verification methods requires a substantial number of high-quality images. To tackle these challenges, the generation of synthetic biometric data has gained traction due to its ability to protect privacy while enabling effective training of deep learning-based biometric verification methods. In this paper, we present a new framework to synthesize forehead-crease image data while maintaining important features, such as uniqueness and realism. The proposed framework consists of two main modules: a Subject-Specific Generation Module (SSGM), based on an image-to-image Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM), which learns a one-to-many mapping between image pairs to generate identity-aware synthetic forehead creases corresponding to real subjects, and a Subject-Agnostic Generation Module (SAGM), which samples new synthetic identities with assistance from the SSGM. We evaluate the diversity and realism of the generated forehead-crease images primarily using the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). In addition, we assess the utility of synthetically generated forehead-crease images using a forehead-crease verification system (FHCVS). The results indicate an improvement in the verification accuracy of the FHCVS by utilizing synthetic data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15708">Towards Realistic Example-based Modeling via 3D Gaussian Stitching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Gao, Ziyi Yang, Bingchen Gong, Xiaoguang Han, Sipeng Yang, Xiaogang Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Using parts of existing models to rebuild new models, commonly termed as example-based modeling, is a classical methodology in the realm of computer graphics. Previous works mostly focus on shape composition, making them very hard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world scenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to achieve seamless appearance blending. However, the current SeamlessNeRF method struggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for real-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based representation. To this end, we present an example-based modeling method that combines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using sample-guided synthesis. Specifically, as for composition, we create a GUI to segment and transform multiple fields in real time, easily obtaining a semantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). For texture blending, due to the discrete and irregular nature of 3DGS, straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF is not supported. Thus, a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to harmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content. Our workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and transformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI, 2) KNN analysis to identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and target models, and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using sampling-based cloning and gradient constraints. Extensive experimental results validate that our approach significantly outperforms previous works in terms of realistic synthesis, demonstrating its practicality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Chew, Po-Yi Lu, Jayden Lin, Hsuan-Tien Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have been widely adopted in real-world applications due to their ability to generate realistic images from textual descriptions. However, recent studies have shown that these methods are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite the significant threat posed by backdoor attacks on text-to-image diffusion models, countermeasures remain under-explored. In this paper, we address this research gap by demonstrating that state-of-the-art backdoor attacks against text-to-image diffusion models can be effectively mitigated by a surprisingly simple defense strategy - textual perturbation. Experiments show that textual perturbations are effective in defending against state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with minimal sacrifice to generation quality. We analyze the efficacy of textual perturbation from two angles: text embedding space and cross-attention maps. They further explain how backdoor attacks have compromised text-to-image diffusion models, providing insights for studying future attack and defense strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Shang, Zhenyu Li, Wenhao Pei, Pengjie Xu, ZhaoJun Deng, Fanchen Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Place Recognition (VLVPR) enhances robot localization performance by incorporating natural language descriptions from images. By utilizing language information, VLVPR directs robot place matching, overcoming the constraint of solely depending on vision. The essence of multimodal fusion lies in mining the complementary information between different modalities. However, general fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are not well equipped to capture the dynamics of cross modal interactions, especially in the presence of complex intra modal and inter modal correlations. To this end, this paper proposes a novel coarse to fine and end to end connected cross modal place recognition framework, called MambaPlace. In the coarse localization stage, the text description and 3D point cloud are encoded by the pretrained T5 and instance encoder, respectively. They are then processed using Text Attention Mamba (TAM) and Point Clouds Mamba (PCM) for data enhancement and alignment. In the subsequent fine localization stage, the features of the text description and 3D point cloud are cross modally fused and further enhanced through cascaded Cross Attention Mamba (CCAM). Finally, we predict the positional offset from the fused text point cloud features, achieving the most accurate localization. Extensive experiments show that MambaPlace achieves improved localization accuracy on the KITTI360Pose dataset compared to the state of the art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread use of vector graphics creates a significant demand for vectorization methods. While recent learning-based techniques have shown their capability to create vector images of clear topology, filling these primitives with gradients remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a segmentation-guided vectorization framework to convert raster images into concise vector graphics with radial gradient fills. With the guidance of an embedded gradient-aware segmentation subroutine, our approach progressively appends gradient-filled B\'ezier paths to the output, where primitive parameters are initiated with our newly designed initialization technique and are optimized to minimize our novel loss function. We build our method on a differentiable renderer with traditional segmentation algorithms to develop it as a model-free tool for raster-to-vector conversion. It is tested on various inputs to demonstrate its feasibility, independent of datasets, to synthesize vector graphics with improved visual quality and layer-wise topology compared to prior work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zherong Zhang, Chunyu Lin, Shujuan Huang, Shangrong Yang, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Relative pose estimation is crucial for various computer vision applications, including Robotic and Autonomous Driving. Current methods primarily depend on selecting and matching feature points prone to incorrect matches, leading to poor performance. Consequently, relying solely on point-matching relationships for pose estimation is a huge challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Geometric Correspondence Graph neural network that integrates point features with extra structured line segments. This integration of matched points and line segments further exploits the geometry constraints and enhances model performance across different environments. We employ the Dual-Graph module and Feature Weighted Fusion Module to aggregate geometric and visual features effectively, facilitating complex scene understanding. We demonstrate our approach through extensive experiments on the DeMoN and KITTI Odometry datasets. The results show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Huang, Jingyi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mimic human perception and reasoning system by integrating powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with various modality encoders (e.g., vision, audio), positioning LLMs as the "brain" and various modality encoders as sensory organs. This framework endows MLLMs with human-like capabilities, and suggests a potential pathway towards achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). With the emergence of all-round MLLMs like GPT-4V and Gemini, a multitude of evaluation methods have been developed to assess their capabilities across different dimensions. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review of MLLM evaluation methods, covering the following key aspects: (1) the background of MLLMs and their evaluation; (2) "what to evaluate" that reviews and categorizes existing MLLM evaluation tasks based on the capabilities assessed, including general multimodal recognition, perception, reasoning and trustworthiness, and domain-specific applications such as socioeconomic, natural sciences and engineering, medical usage, AI agent, remote sensing, video and audio processing, 3D point cloud analysis, and others; (3) "where to evaluate" that summarizes MLLM evaluation benchmarks into general and specific benchmarks; (4) "how to evaluate" that reviews and illustrates MLLM evaluation steps and metrics; Our overarching goal is to provide valuable insights for researchers in the field of MLLM evaluation, thereby facilitating the development of more capable and reliable MLLMs. We emphasize that evaluation should be regarded as a critical discipline, essential for advancing the field of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Wang, Shaoqi Yan, Yang Liu, Wei Song, Jing Liu, Yang Chang, Xinji Mai, Xiping Hu, Wenqiang Zhang, Zhongxue Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) aims to analyze emotional states from static images and dynamic sequences, which is pivotal in enhancing anthropomorphic communication among humans, robots, and digital avatars by leveraging AI technologies. As the FER field evolves from controlled laboratory environments to more complex in-the-wild scenarios, advanced methods have been rapidly developed and new challenges and apporaches are encounted, which are not well addressed in existing reviews of FER. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of both image-based static FER (SFER) and video-based dynamic FER (DFER) methods, analyzing from model-oriented development to challenge-focused categorization. We begin with a critical comparison of recent reviews, an introduction to common datasets and evaluation criteria, and an in-depth workflow on FER to establish a robust research foundation. We then systematically review representative approaches addressing eight main challenges in SFER (such as expression disturbance, uncertainties, compound emotions, and cross-domain inconsistency) as well as seven main challenges in DFER (such as key frame sampling, expression intensity variations, and cross-modal alignment). Additionally, we analyze recent advancements, benchmark performances, major applications, and ethical considerations. Finally, we propose five promising future directions and development trends to guide ongoing research. The project page for this paper can be found at https://github.com/wangyanckxx/SurveyFER.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Denner, Markus Bujotzek, Dimitrios Bounias, David Zimmerer, Raphael Stock, Paul F. J\"ager, Klaus Maier-Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image classification in radiology faces significant challenges, particularly in generalizing to unseen pathologies. In contrast, CLIP offers a promising solution by leveraging multimodal learning to improve zero-shot classification performance. However, in the medical domain, lesions can be small and might not be well represented in the embedding space. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the potential of visual prompt engineering to enhance the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in radiology. Leveraging BiomedCLIP, trained on extensive biomedical image-text pairs, we investigate the impact of embedding visual markers directly within radiological images to guide the model's attention to critical regions. Our evaluation on the JSRT dataset, focusing on lung nodule malignancy classification, demonstrates that incorporating visual prompts $\unicode{x2013}$ such as arrows, circles, and contours $\unicode{x2013}$ significantly improves classification metrics including AUROC, AUPRC, F1 score, and accuracy. Moreover, the study provides attention maps, showcasing enhanced model interpretability and focus on clinically relevant areas. These findings underscore the efficacy of visual prompt engineering as a straightforward yet powerful approach to advance VLM performance in medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osama Mustafa, Khizer Ali, Anam Bibi, Imran Siddiqi, Momina Moetesum</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of intelligent automation is growing significantly in the automotive industry, as it assists drivers and fleet management companies, thus increasing their productivity. Dash cams are now been used for this purpose which enables the instant identification and understanding of multiple objects and occurrences in the surroundings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for object detection in dashcams using transformers. Our system is based on the state-of-the-art DEtection TRansformer (DETR), which has demonstrated strong performance in a variety of conditions, including different weather and illumination scenarios. The use of transformers allows for the consideration of contextual information in decisionmaking, improving the accuracy of object detection. To validate our approach, we have trained our DETR model on a dataset that represents real-world conditions. Our results show that the use of intelligent automation through transformers can significantly enhance the capabilities of dashcam systems. The model achieves an mAP of 0.95 on detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Bragagnolo, Matteo Terreran, Davide Allegro, Stefano Ghidoni</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust 3D human pose estimation is crucial to ensure safe and effective human-robot collaboration. Accurate human perception,however, is particularly challenging in these scenarios due to strong occlusions and limited camera viewpoints. Current 3D human pose estimation approaches are rather vulnerable in such conditions. In this work we present a novel approach for robust 3D human pose estimation in the context of human-robot collaboration. Instead of relying on noisy 2D features triangulation, we perform multi-view fusion on 3D skeletons provided by absolute monocular methods. Accurate 3D pose estimation is then obtained via reprojection error optimization, introducing limbs length symmetry constraints. We evaluate our approach on the public dataset Human3.6M and on a novel version Human3.6M-Occluded, derived adding synthetic occlusions on the camera views with the purpose of testing pose estimation algorithms under severe occlusions. We further validate our method on real human-robot collaboration workcells, in which we strongly surpass current 3D human pose estimation methods. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view human pose estimation techniques and demonstrates superior capabilities in handling challenging scenarios with strong occlusions, representing a reliable and effective solution for real human-robot collaboration setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yang, Jianbiao Mei, Liang Liu, Siliang Du, Yilin Xiao, Jongwon Ra, Yong Liu, Xiao Xu, Huifeng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR panoptic segmentation, which jointly performs instance and semantic segmentation for things and stuff classes, plays a fundamental role in LiDAR perception tasks. While most existing methods explicitly separate these two segmentation tasks and utilize different branches (i.e., semantic and instance branches), some recent methods have embraced the query-based paradigm to unify LiDAR panoptic segmentation. However, the distinct spatial distribution and inherent characteristics of objects(things) and their surroundings(stuff) in 3D scenes lead to challenges, including the mutual competition of things/stuff and the ambiguity of classification/segmentation. In this paper, we propose decoupling things/stuff queries according to their intrinsic properties for individual decoding and disentangling classification/segmentation to mitigate ambiguity. To this end, we propose a novel framework dubbed DQFormer to implement semantic and instance segmentation in a unified workflow. Specifically, we design a decoupled query generator to propose informative queries with semantics by localizing things/stuff positions and fusing multi-level BEV embeddings. Moreover, a query-oriented mask decoder is introduced to decode corresponding segmentation masks by performing masked cross-attention between queries and mask embeddings. Finally, the decoded masks are combined with the semantics of the queries to produce panoptic results. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DQFormer framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Liu, Lintao Wang, Xiaogan Zhu, Xuequan Lu, Zhiyong Wang, Kun Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme Multimodal Summarization with Multimodal Output (XMSMO) becomes an attractive summarization approach by integrating various types of information to create extremely concise yet informative summaries for individual modalities. Existing methods overlook the issue that multimodal data often contains more topic irrelevant information, which can mislead the model into producing inaccurate summaries especially for extremely short ones. In this paper, we propose SITransformer, a \textbf{S}hared \textbf{I}nformation-guided \textbf{T}ransformer for extreme multimodal summarization. It has a shared information guided pipeline which involves a cross-modal shared information extractor and a cross-modal interaction module. The extractor formulates semantically shared salient information from different modalities by devising a novel filtering process consisting of a differentiable top-k selector and a shared-information guided gating unit. As a result, the common, salient, and relevant contents across modalities are identified. Next, a transformer with cross-modal attentions is developed for intra- and inter-modality learning with the shared information guidance to produce the extreme summary. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SITransformer significantly enhances the summarization quality for both video and text summaries for XMSMO.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jens Bayer, Stefan Becker, David M\"unch, Michael Arens</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial patches in computer vision can be used, to fool deep neural networks and manipulate their decision-making process. One of the most prominent examples of adversarial patches are evasion attacks for object detectors. By covering parts of objects of interest, these patches suppress the detections and thus make the target object 'invisible' to the object detector. Since these patches are usually optimized on a specific network with a specific train dataset, the transferability across multiple networks and datasets is not given. This paper addresses these issues and investigates the transferability across numerous object detector architectures. Our extensive evaluation across various models on two distinct datasets indicates that patches optimized with larger models provide better network transferability than patches that are optimized with smaller models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video key frame extraction is important in various fields, such as video summary, retrieval, and compression. Therefore, we suggest a video key frame extraction algorithm based on shot segmentation using Von Neumann entropy. The segmentation of shots is achieved through the computation of Von Neumann entropy of the similarity matrix among frames within the video sequence. The initial frame of each shot is selected as key frames, which combines the temporal sequence information of frames. The experimental results show the extracted key frames can fully and accurately represent the original video content while minimizing the number of repeated frames.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving training requires a diverse range of datasets encompassing various traffic conditions, weather scenarios, and road types. Traditional data augmentation methods often struggle to generate datasets that represent rare occurrences. To address this challenge, we propose GenDDS, a novel approach for generating driving scenarios generation by leveraging the capabilities of Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), an advanced latent diffusion model. Our methodology involves the use of descriptive prompts to guide the synthesis process, aimed at producing realistic and diverse driving scenarios. With the power of the latest computer vision techniques, such as ControlNet and Hotshot-XL, we have built a complete pipeline for video generation together with SDXL. We employ the KITTI dataset, which includes real-world driving videos, to train the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our model can generate high-quality driving videos that closely replicate the complexity and variability of real-world driving scenarios. This research contributes to the development of sophisticated training data for autonomous driving systems and opens new avenues for creating virtual environments for simulation and validation purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofei Huang, Rui Ling, Hongyu Li, Tianrui Hui, Zongheng Tang, Xiaoming Wei, Jizhong Han, Si Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Audio-Language-Referenced SAM 2 (AL-Ref-SAM 2) pipeline to explore the training-free paradigm for audio and language-referenced video object segmentation, namely AVS and RVOS tasks. The intuitive solution leverages GroundingDINO to identify the target object from a single frame and SAM 2 to segment the identified object throughout the video, which is less robust to spatiotemporal variations due to a lack of video context exploration. Thus, in our AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline, we propose a novel GPT-assisted Pivot Selection (GPT-PS) module to instruct GPT-4 to perform two-step temporal-spatial reasoning for sequentially selecting pivot frames and pivot boxes, thereby providing SAM 2 with a high-quality initial object prompt. Within GPT-PS, two task-specific Chain-of-Thought prompts are designed to unleash GPT's temporal-spatial reasoning capacity by guiding GPT to make selections based on a comprehensive understanding of video and reference information. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Binded Reference Unification (LBRU) module to convert audio signals into language-formatted references, thereby unifying the formats of AVS and RVOS tasks in the same pipeline. Extensive experiments on both tasks show that our training-free AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline achieves performances comparable to or even better than fully-supervised fine-tuning methods.

<p>Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-MoD, a novel framework designed to enable the efficient training of small-scale Multimodal Language Models (s-MLLM) by distilling knowledge from large-scale MLLM (l-MLLM). Our approach tackles two fundamental challenges in MLLM distillation. First, we optimize the network structure of s-MLLM by integrating a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture into the language model, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Second, we propose a progressive knowledge transfer strategy to ensure comprehensive knowledge migration. This strategy begins with mimic distillation, where we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between output distributions to enable the student model to emulate the teacher network's understanding. Following this, we introduce preference distillation via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where the key lies in treating l-MLLM as the reference model. During this phase, the s-MLLM's ability to discriminate between superior and inferior examples is significantly enhanced beyond l-MLLM, leading to a better student that surpasses its teacher, particularly in hallucination benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-MoD outperforms existing models across various multimodal benchmarks while maintaining a minimal number of activated parameters and low computational costs. Remarkably, LLaVA-MoD, with only 2B activated parameters, surpasses Qwen-VL-Chat-7B by an average of 8.8% across benchmarks, using merely 0.3% of the training data and 23% trainable parameters. These results underscore LLaVA-MoD's ability to effectively distill comprehensive knowledge from its teacher model, paving the way for the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code will be available on: https://github.com/shufangxun/LLaVA-MoD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayodeji Ijishakin, Ana Lawry Aguila, Elizabeth Levitis, Ahmed Abdulaal, Andre Altmann, James Cole</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining neuroimaging datasets from multiple sites and scanners can help increase statistical power and thus provide greater insight into subtle neuroanatomical effects. However, site-specific effects pose a challenge by potentially obscuring the biological signal and introducing unwanted variance. Existing harmonization techniques, which use statistical models to remove such effects, have been shown to incompletely remove site effects while also failing to preserve biological variability. More recently, generative models using GANs or autoencoder-based approaches, have been proposed for site adjustment. However, such methods are known for instability during training or blurry image generation. In recent years, diffusion models have become increasingly popular for their ability to generate high-quality synthetic images. In this work, we introduce the disentangled diffusion autoencoder (DDAE), a novel diffusion model designed for controlling specific aspects of an image. We apply the DDAE to the task of harmonizing MR images by generating high-quality site-adjusted images that preserve biological variability. We use data from 7 different sites and demonstrate the DDAE's superiority in generating high-resolution, harmonized 2D MR images over previous approaches. As far as we are aware, this work marks the first diffusion-based model for site adjustment of neuroimaging data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feize Wu, Yun Pang, Junyi Zhang, Lianyu Pang, Jian Yin, Baoquan Zhao, Qing Li, Xudong Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image personalization have enabled high-quality and controllable image synthesis for user-provided concepts. However, existing methods still struggle to balance identity preservation with text alignment. Our approach is based on the fact that generating prompt-aligned images requires a precise semantic understanding of the prompt, which involves accurately processing the interactions between the new concept and its surrounding context tokens within the CLIP text encoder. To address this, we aim to embed the new concept properly into the input embedding space of the text encoder, allowing for seamless integration with existing tokens. We introduce Context Regularization (CoRe), which enhances the learning of the new concept's text embedding by regularizing its context tokens in the prompt. This is based on the insight that appropriate output vectors of the text encoder for the context tokens can only be achieved if the new concept's text embedding is correctly learned. CoRe can be applied to arbitrary prompts without requiring the generation of corresponding images, thus improving the generalization of the learned text embedding. Additionally, CoRe can serve as a test-time optimization technique to further enhance the generations for specific prompts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several baseline methods in both identity preservation and text alignment. Code will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15915">Leveraging Open Knowledge for Advancing Task Expertise in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuncheng Yang, Yulei Qin, Tong Wu, Zihan Xu, Gang Li, Pengcheng Guo, Hang Shao, Yucheng Shi, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Jie Yang, Yun Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The cultivation of expertise for large language models (LLMs) to solve tasks of specific areas often requires special-purpose tuning with calibrated behaviors on the expected stable outputs. To avoid huge cost brought by manual preparation of instruction datasets and training resources up to hundreds of hours, the exploitation of open knowledge including a wealth of low rank adaptation (LoRA) models and instruction datasets serves as a good starting point. However, existing methods on model and data selection focus on the performance of general-purpose capabilities while neglecting the knowledge gap exposed in domain-specific deployment. In the present study, we propose to bridge such gap by introducing few human-annotated samples (i.e., K-shot) for advancing task expertise of LLMs with open knowledge. Specifically, we develop an efficient and scalable pipeline to cost-efficiently produce task experts where K-shot data intervene in selecting the most promising expert candidates and the task-relevant instructions. A mixture-of-expert (MoE) system is built to make the best use of individual-yet-complementary knowledge between multiple experts. We unveil the two keys to the success of a MoE system, 1) the abidance by K-shot, and 2) the insistence on diversity. For the former, we ensure that models that truly possess problem-solving abilities on K-shot are selected rather than those blind guessers. Besides, during data selection, instructions that share task-relevant contexts with K-shot are prioritized. For the latter, we highlight the diversity of constituting experts and that of the fine-tuning instructions throughout the model and data selection process. Extensive experimental results confirm the superiority of our approach over existing methods on utilization of open knowledge across various tasks. Codes and models will be released later.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junaid Wahid, Fangneng Zhan, Pramod Rao, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: Face aging is the process of converting an individual's appearance to a younger or older version of themselves. Existing face aging techniques have been limited to 2D settings, which often weaken their applications as there is a growing demand for 3D face modeling. Moreover, existing aging methods struggle to perform faithful aging, maintain identity, and retain the fine details of the input images. Given these limitations and the need for a 3D-aware aging method, we propose DiffAge3D, the first 3D-aware aging framework that not only performs faithful aging and identity preservation but also operates in a 3D setting. Our aging framework allows to model the aging and camera pose separately by only taking a single image with a target age. Our framework includes a robust 3D-aware aging dataset generation pipeline by utilizing a pre-trained 3D GAN and the rich text embedding capabilities within CLIP model. Notably, we do not employ any inversion bottleneck in dataset generation. Instead, we randomly generate training samples from the latent space of 3D GAN, allowing us to manipulate the rich latent space of GAN to generate ages even with large gaps. With the generated dataset, we train a viewpoint-aware diffusion-based aging model to control the camera pose and facial age. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that DiffAge3D outperforms existing methods, particularly in multiview-consistent aging and fine details preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot image classification is a challenging task in the field of machine learning, involving the identification of new categories using a limited number of labeled samples. In recent years, methods based on local descriptors have made significant progress in this area. However, the key to improving classification accuracy lies in effectively filtering background noise and accurately selecting critical local descriptors highly relevant to image category information.
  To address this challenge, we propose an innovative weighted adaptive threshold filtering (WATF) strategy for local descriptors. This strategy can dynamically adjust based on the current task and image context, thereby selecting local descriptors most relevant to the image category. This enables the model to better focus on category-related information while effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant background regions.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we adopted the N-way K-shot experimental framework. Experimental results show that our method not only improves the clustering effect of selected local descriptors but also significantly enhances the discriminative ability between image categories. Notably, our method maintains a simple and lightweight design philosophy without introducing additional learnable parameters. This feature ensures consistency in filtering capability during both training and testing phases, further enhancing the reliability and practicality of the method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thibaut Goldsborough, Ben Philps, Alan O'Callaghan, Fiona Inglis, Leo Leplat, Andrew Filby, Hakan Bilen, Peter Bankhead</p>
<p>Abstract: Cell and nucleus segmentation are fundamental tasks for quantitative bioimage analysis. Despite progress in recent years, biologists and other domain experts still require novel algorithms to handle increasingly large and complex real-world datasets. These algorithms must not only achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, but also be optimized for efficiency, portability and user-friendliness. Here, we introduce InstanSeg: a novel embedding-based instance segmentation pipeline designed to identify cells and nuclei in microscopy images. Using six public cell segmentation datasets, we demonstrate that InstanSeg can significantly improve accuracy when compared to the most widely used alternative methods, while reducing the processing time by at least 60%. Furthermore, InstanSeg is designed to be fully serializable as TorchScript and supports GPU acceleration on a range of hardware. We provide an open-source implementation of InstanSeg in Python, in addition to a user-friendly, interactive QuPath extension for inference written in Java. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeduo Zhang, Yalda Mohsenzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Current anomaly detection methods excel with benchmark industrial data but struggle with natural images and medical data due to varying definitions of 'normal' and 'abnormal.' This makes accurate identification of deviations in these fields particularly challenging. Especially for 3D brain MRI data, all the state-of-the-art models are reconstruction-based with 3D convolutional neural networks which are memory-intensive, time-consuming and producing noisy outputs that require further post-processing. We propose a framework called Simple Slice-based Network (SimpleSliceNet), which utilizes a model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on a separate MRI dataset as a 2D slice feature extractor to reduce computational cost. We aggregate the extracted features to perform anomaly detection tasks on 3D brain MRI volumes. Our model integrates a conditional normalizing flow to calculate log likelihood of features and employs the Semi-Push-Pull Mechanism to enhance anomaly detection accuracy. The results indicate improved performance, showcasing our model's remarkable adaptability and effectiveness when addressing the challenges exists in brain MRI data. In addition, for the large-scale 3D brain volumes, our model SimpleSliceNet outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D and 3D models in terms of accuracy, memory usage and time consumption.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Tang, Xu Han, Xianzhi Li, Qiao Yu, Jinfeng Xu, Yixue Hao, Long Hu, Min Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the 3D physical world remains a significant challenge. Due to the lack of large-scale 3D-text pair datasets, the success of LLMs has yet to be replicated in 3D understanding. In this paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient Point-Language Understanding. The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D object understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To address this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to compensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align images and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the 3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly connect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is established, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the intermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data. Specifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a three-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic connections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality alignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling. Extensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D training data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D understanding. Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using text-only data. The code and weights are available at: https://github.com/TangYuan96/GreenPLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyuan Zhang, Ling Yang, Zejian Li, An Zhao, Chenye Meng, Changyuan Yang, Guang Yang, Zhiyuan Yang, Lingyun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungduk Yu, Brian L. White, Anahita Bhiwandiwalla, Musashi Hinck, Matthew Lyle Olson, Tung Nguyen, Vasudev Lal</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and attributing temperature increases due to climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and guiding adaptation strategies. The complexity of distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability has challenged traditional detection and attribution (D&A) approaches, which seek to identify specific "fingerprints" in climate response variables. Deep learning offers potential for discerning these complex patterns in expansive spatial datasets. However, lack of standard protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies. We introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset of over 816k daily climate snapshots, designed to enhance model accuracy in identifying climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in past research, ensuring comparability and consistency. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data, a novel and modernizing approach in this context. Our open-access data and code serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science through improved model evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhang, Jiaqi Ma, Guoli Wang, Qian Zhang, Huan Zhang, Lefei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The limitations of task-specific and general image restoration methods for specific degradation have prompted the development of all-in-one image restoration techniques. However, the diversity of patterns among multiple degradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between degraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted versions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1) prompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage, we leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable of distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image similarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver and difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware learning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage. For the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature extraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by utilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale vision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior generalization ability when dealing with unseen tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Basavaraj Sunagad, Heming Zhu, Mohit Mendiratta, Adam Kortylewski, Christian Theobalt, Marc Habermann</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past years, significant progress has been made in creating photorealistic and drivable 3D avatars solely from videos of real humans. However, a core remaining challenge is the fine-grained and user-friendly editing of clothing styles by means of textual descriptions. To this end, we present TEDRA, the first method allowing text-based edits of an avatar, which maintains the avatar's high fidelity, space-time coherency, as well as dynamics, and enables skeletal pose and view control. We begin by training a model to create a controllable and high-fidelity digital replica of the real actor. Next, we personalize a pretrained generative diffusion model by fine-tuning it on various frames of the real character captured from different camera angles, ensuring the digital representation faithfully captures the dynamics and movements of the real person. This two-stage process lays the foundation for our approach to dynamic human avatar editing. Utilizing this personalized diffusion model, we modify the dynamic avatar based on a provided text prompt using our Personalized Normal Aligned Score Distillation Sampling (PNA-SDS) within a model-based guidance framework. Additionally, we propose a time step annealing strategy to ensure high-quality edits. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over prior work in functionality and visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Jhe Huang, Min-Hung Chen, Shang-Hong Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks. Models and code: https://github.com/NVlabs/Eagle</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a parameter-efficient Hierarchical Spatial Temporal Network (HiSTN) specifically designed for the task of emotion classification using multi-channel electroencephalogram data. The network incorporates a graph hierarchy constructed from bottom-up at various abstraction levels, offering the dual advantages of enhanced task-relevant deep feature extraction and a lightweight design. The model's effectiveness is further amplified when used in conjunction with a proposed unique label smoothing method. Comprehensive benchmark experiments reveal that this combined approach yields high, balanced performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative predictions. HiSTN, which has approximately 1,000 parameters, achieves mean F1 scores of 96.82% (valence) and 95.62% (arousal) in subject-dependent tests on the rarely-utilized 5-classification task problem from the DREAMER dataset. In the subject-independent settings, the same model yields mean F1 scores of 78.34% for valence and 81.59% for arousal. The adoption of the Sequential Top-2 Hit Rate (Seq2HR) metric highlights the significant enhancements in terms of the balance between model's quantitative and qualitative for predictions achieved through our approach when compared to training with regular one-hot labels. These improvements surpass 50% in subject-dependent tasks and 30% in subject-independent tasks. The study also includes relevant ablation studies and case explorations to further elucidate the workings of the proposed model and enhance its interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) systems, particularly those utilizing open-source frameworks, have become increasingly prevalent in the production of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated visuals. While existing literature has explored various problematic aspects of TTI technologies, such as bias in generated content, intellectual property concerns, and the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes, open-source TTI frameworks have not yet been systematically examined from a cultural perspective. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the CivitAI platform, a leading open-source platform dedicated to TTI AI. We introduce the Civiverse prompt dataset, encompassing millions of images and related metadata. We focus on prompt analysis, specifically examining the semantic characteristics of text prompts, as it is crucial for addressing societal issues related to generative technologies. This analysis provides insights into user intentions, preferences, and behaviors, which in turn shape the outputs of these models. Our findings reveal a predominant preference for generating explicit content, along with a focus on homogenization of semantic content. These insights underscore the need for further research into the perpetuation of misogyny, harmful stereotypes, and the uniformity of visual culture within these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangping Lin, Yan Ke, Ke Niu, Jia Liu, Xiaoyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the popularity of video applications, the security of video content has emerged as a pressing issue that demands urgent attention. Most video content protection methods mainly rely on encryption technology, which needs to be manually designed or implemented in an experience-based manner. To address this problem, we propose an automatic encryption technique for video content protection based on implicit neural representation. We design a key-controllable module, which serves as a key for encryption and decryption. NeR-VCP first pre-distributes the key-controllable module trained by the sender to the recipients, and then uses Implicit Neural Representation (INR) with a (pre-distributed) key-controllable module to encrypt plain video as an implicit neural network, and the legal recipients uses a pre-distributed key-controllable module to decrypt this cipher neural network (the corresponding implicit neural network). Under the guidance of the key-controllable design, our method can improve the security of video content and provide a novel video encryption scheme. Moreover, using model compression techniques, this method can achieve video content protection while effectively mitigating the amount of encrypted data transferred. We experimentally find that it has superior performance in terms of visual representation, imperceptibility to illegal users, and security from a cryptographic viewpoint.</p>

We employ a teacher-student paradigm, using a foundational vision language model like GPT-4 as a teacher to create instruction-following multimodal data for customizing the student model, sLAVA, for electron microscopic image analysis tasks on consumer hardware with limited budgets. Our approach allows enterprises to further fine-tune the proposed framework with their proprietary data securely within their own infrastructure, protecting intellectual property. Rigorous experiments validate that our framework surpasses traditional methods, handles data shifts, and enables high-throughput screening.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a growing field of computer science that has found many practical applications in several domains, including Health. However, as data grows in size and availability, and the number of models that aim to aid or replace human decisions, it raises the concern that these models can be susceptible to bias, which can lead to harm to specific individuals by basing its decisions on protected attributes such as gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and others. Visualization techniques might generate insights and help summarize large datasets, enabling data scientists to understand the data better before training a model by evaluating pre-training metrics applied to the datasets before training, which might contribute to identifying potential harm before any effort is put into training and deploying the models. This work uses the severe acute respiratory syndrome dataset from OpenDataSUS to visualize three pre-training bias metrics and their distribution across different regions in Brazil. A random forest model is trained in each region and applied to the others. The aim is to compare the bias for the different regions, focusing on their protected attributes and comparing the model's performance with the metric values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Zand, Milad Nasr</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative image models, since introduction, have become a global phenomenon. From new arts becoming possible to new vectors of abuse, many new capabilities have become available. One of the challenging issues with generative models is controlling the generation process specially to prevent specific generations classes or instances . There are several reasons why one may want to control the output of generative models, ranging from privacy and safety concerns to application limitations or user preferences
  To address memorization and privacy challenges, there has been considerable research dedicated to filtering prompts or filtering the outputs of these models. What all these solutions have in common is that at the end of the day they stop the model from producing anything, hence limiting the usability of the model. In this paper, we propose a method for addressing this usability issue by making it possible to steer away from unwanted concepts (when detected in model's output) and still generating outputs. In particular we focus on the latent diffusion image generative models and how one can prevent them to generate particular images while generating similar images with limited overhead.
  We focus on mitigating issues like image memorization, demonstrating our technique's effectiveness through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our method successfully prevents the generation of memorized training images while maintaining comparable image quality and relevance to the unmodified model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Huang, Junhao Shen, Qiuyu Luo, Karanjit Kooner, Tsengdar Lee, Yishen Liu, Jia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recently years, a significant amount of research has been conducted on applying deep learning methods for glaucoma classification and detection. However, the explainability of those established machine learning models remains a big concern. In this research, in contrast, we learn from cognitive science concept and study how ophthalmologists judge glaucoma detection. Simulating experts' efforts, we propose a hierarchical decision making system, centered around a holistic set of carefully designed biomarker-oriented machine learning models. While biomarkers represent the key indicators of how ophthalmologists identify glaucoma, they usually exhibit latent inter-relations. We thus construct a time series model, named TRI-LSTM, capable of calculating and uncovering potential and latent relationships among various biomarkers of glaucoma. Our model is among the first efforts to explore the intrinsic connections among glaucoma biomarkers. We monitor temporal relationships in patients' disease states over time and to capture and retain the progression of disease-relevant clinical information from prior visits, thereby enriching biomarker's potential relationships. Extensive experiments over real-world dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Pablo Rodriguez-Gomez, Jose Ramiro Martinez-de Dios, Anibal Ollero, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based perception systems are typically exposed to large orientation changes in different robot applications. In such conditions, their performance might be compromised due to the inherent complexity of processing data captured under challenging motion. Integration of mechanical stabilizers to compensate for the camera rotation is not always possible due to the robot payload constraints. This paper presents a processing-based stabilization approach to compensate the camera's rotational motion both on events and on frames (i.e., images). Assuming that the camera's attitude is available, we evaluate the benefits of stabilization in two perception applications: feature tracking and estimating the translation component of the camera's ego-motion. The validation is performed using synthetic data and sequences from well-known event-based vision datasets. The experiments unveil that stabilization can improve feature tracking and camera ego-motion estimation accuracy in 27.37% and 34.82%, respectively. Concurrently, stabilization can reduce the processing time of computing the camera's linear velocity by at least 25%. Code is available at https://github.com/tub-rip/visual_stabilization</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suman Ghosh, Valentina Cavinato, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) and SLAM are fundamental components for spatial perception in mobile robots. Despite enormous progress in the field, current VO/SLAM systems are limited by their sensors' capability. Event cameras are novel visual sensors that offer advantages to overcome the limitations of standard cameras, enabling robots to expand their operating range to challenging scenarios, such as high-speed motion and high dynamic range illumination. We propose a novel event-based stereo VO system by combining two ideas: a correspondence-free mapping module that estimates depth by maximizing ray density fusion and a tracking module that estimates camera poses by maximizing edge-map alignment. We evaluate the system comprehensively on five real-world datasets, spanning a variety of camera types (manufacturers and spatial resolutions) and scenarios (driving, flying drone, hand-held, egocentric, etc). The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art in majority of the test sequences by a margin, e.g., trajectory error reduction of 45% on RPG dataset, 61% on DSEC dataset, and 21% on TUM-VIE dataset. To benefit the community and foster research on event-based perception systems, we release the source code and results: https://github.com/tub-rip/ES-PTAM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Foghor Tanshi, Dirk S\"offker</p>
<p>Abstract: In conditional automation, the automated driving system assumes full control and only issues a takeover request to a human driver to resume driving in critical situations. Previous studies have concluded that the time budget required by drivers to resume driving after a takeover request varies with situations and different takeover variables. However, no comprehensive generalized approaches for estimating in advance the time budget required by drivers to takeover have been provided. In this contribution, fixed (7 s) and variable time budgets (6 s, 5 s, and 4 s) with and without visual imagery assistance were investigated for suitability in three takeover scenarios using performance measures such as average lateral displacement. The results indicate that 7 s is suitable for two of the studied scenarios based on their characteristics. Using the obtained results and known relations between takeover variables, a mathematical formula for estimating takeover request time budget is proposed. The proposed formula integrates individual stimulus response time, driving experience, scenario specific requirements and allows increased safety for takeover maneuvers. Furthermore, the visual imagery resulted in increased takeover time which invariably increases the time budget. Thus the time demand of the visualized information if applicable (such as visual imagery) should be included in the time budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Aron Samuel Kov\'acs, Pedro Hermosilla, Renata G. Raidou</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce G-Style, a novel algorithm designed to transfer the style of an image onto a 3D scene represented using Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting is a powerful 3D representation for novel view synthesis, as -- compared to other approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields -- it provides fast scene renderings and user control over the scene. Recent pre-prints have demonstrated that the style of Gaussian Splatting scenes can be modified using an image exemplar. However, since the scene geometry remains fixed during the stylization process, current solutions fall short of producing satisfactory results. Our algorithm aims to address these limitations by following a three-step process: In a pre-processing step, we remove undesirable Gaussians with large projection areas or highly elongated shapes. Subsequently, we combine several losses carefully designed to preserve different scales of the style in the image, while maintaining as much as possible the integrity of the original scene content. During the stylization process and following the original design of Gaussian Splatting, we split Gaussians where additional detail is necessary within our scene by tracking the gradient of the stylized color. Our experiments demonstrate that G-Style generates high-quality stylizations within just a few minutes, outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\'as Soncini, Javier Civera, Taih\'u Pire</p>
<p>Abstract: While visual SLAM systems are well studied and achieve impressive results in indoor and urban settings, natural, outdoor and open-field environments are much less explored and still present relevant research challenges. Visual navigation and local mapping have shown a relatively good performance in open-field environments. However, globally consistent mapping and long-term localization still depend on the robustness of loop detection and closure, for which the literature is scarce. In this work we propose a novel method to pave the way towards robust loop detection in open fields, particularly in agricultural settings, based on local feature search and stereo geometric refinement, with a final stage of relative pose estimation. Our method consistently achieves good loop detections, with a median error of 15cm. We aim to characterize open fields as a novel environment for loop detection, understanding the limitations and problems that arise when dealing with them.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence have driven the development of numerous pathology foundation models capable of extracting clinically relevant information. However, there is currently limited literature independently evaluating these foundation models on truly external cohorts and clinically-relevant tasks to uncover adjustments for future improvements. In this study, we benchmarked ten histopathology foundation models on 13 patient cohorts with 6,791 patients and 9,493 slides from lung, colorectal, gastric, and breast cancers. The models were evaluated on weakly-supervised tasks related to biomarkers, morphological properties, and prognostic outcomes. We show that a vision-language foundation model, CONCH, yielded the highest performance in 42% of tasks when compared to vision-only foundation models. The experiments reveal that foundation models trained on distinct cohorts learn complementary features to predict the same label, and can be fused to outperform the current state of the art. Creating an ensemble of complementary foundation models outperformed CONCH in 66% of tasks. Moreover, our findings suggest that data diversity outweighs data volume for foundation models. Our work highlights actionable adjustments to improve pathology foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqing Zhang, Tianyong Liu, Guojia Fan, Bin Li, Qianjin Feng, Shoujun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D clinical medical images is critical in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases. However, the inherent complexity of spinal anatomy and uncertainty inherent in current imaging technologies, poses significant challenges for semantic segmentation of spinal images. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models have made some progress in spinal segmentation, their limitations in handling long-range dependencies hinder further improvements in segmentation accuracy.To address these challenges, we introduce a residual visual Mamba layer to effectively capture and model the deep semantic features and long-range spatial dependencies of 3D spinal data. To further enhance the structural semantic understanding of the vertebrae, we also propose a novel spinal shape prior module that captures specific anatomical information of the spine from medical images, significantly enhancing the model's ability to extract structural semantic information of the vertebrae. Comparative and ablation experiments on two datasets demonstrate that SpineMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. On the CT dataset, the average Dice similarity coefficient for segmentation reaches as high as 94.40, while on the MR dataset, it reaches 86.95. Notably, compared to the renowned nnU-Net, SpineMamba achieves superior segmentation performance, exceeding it by up to 2 percentage points. This underscores its accuracy, robustness, and excellent generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Plou, Pablo Pueyo, Ruben Martinez-Cantin, Mac Schwager, Ana C. Murillo, Eduardo Montijano</p>
<p>Abstract: Gen-Swarms is an innovative method that leverages and combines the capabilities of deep generative models with reactive navigation algorithms to automate the creation of drone shows. Advancements in deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in generating high-quality 2D images. Building on this success, various works have extended diffusion models to 3D point cloud generation. In contrast, alternative generative models such as flow matching have been proposed, offering a simple and intuitive transition from noise to meaningful outputs. However, the application of flow matching models to 3D point cloud generation remains largely unexplored. Gen-Swarms adapts these models to automatically generate drone shows. Existing 3D point cloud generative models create point trajectories which are impractical for drone swarms. In contrast, our method not only generates accurate 3D shapes but also guides the swarm motion, producing smooth trajectories and accounting for potential collisions through a reactive navigation algorithm incorporated into the sampling process. For example, when given a text category like Airplane, Gen-Swarms can rapidly and continuously generate numerous variations of 3D airplane shapes. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is particularly well-suited for drone shows, providing feasible trajectories, creating representative final shapes, and significantly enhancing the overall performance of drone show generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Cassel, Bastian Boll, Stefania Petra, Peter Albers, Christoph Schn\"orr</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the sigma flow model for the prediction of structured labelings of data observed on Riemannian manifolds, including Euclidean image domains as special case. The approach combines the Laplace-Beltrami framework for image denoising and enhancement, introduced by Sochen, Kimmel and Malladi about 25 years ago, and the assignment flow approach introduced and studied by the authors.
  The sigma flow arises as Riemannian gradient flow of generalized harmonic energies and thus is governed by a nonlinear geometric PDE which determines a harmonic map from a closed Riemannian domain manifold to a statistical manifold, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric from information geometry. A specific ingredient of the sigma flow is the mutual dependency of the Riemannian metric of the domain manifold on the evolving state. This makes the approach amenable to machine learning in a specific way, by realizing this dependency through a mapping with compact time-variant parametrization that can be learned from data. Proof of concept experiments demonstrate the expressivity of the sigma flow model and prediction performance.
  Structural similarities to transformer network architectures and networks generated by the geometric integration of sigma flows are pointed out, which highlights the connection to deep learning and, conversely, may stimulate the use of geometric design principles for structured prediction in other areas of scientific machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikang Liu, Lin Zhao, Eric Z. Chen, Xiao Chen, Terrence Chen, Shanhui Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic coronary roadmapping is a technology that overlays the vessel maps (the "roadmap") extracted from an offline image sequence of X-ray angiography onto a live stream of X-ray fluoroscopy in real-time. It aims to offer navigational guidance for interventional surgeries without the need for repeated contrast agent injections, thereby reducing the risks associated with radiation exposure and kidney failure. The precision of the roadmaps is contingent upon the accurate alignment of angiographic and fluoroscopic images based on their cardiac phases, as well as precise catheter tip tracking. The former ensures the selection of a roadmap that closely matches the vessel shape in the current frame, while the latter uses catheter tips as reference points to adjust for translational motion between the roadmap and the present vessel tree. Training deep learning models for both tasks is challenging and underexplored. However, incorporating catheter features into the models could offer substantial benefits, given humans heavily rely on catheters to complete the tasks. To this end, we introduce a simple but effective method, auxiliary input in training (AIT), and demonstrate that it enhances model performance across both tasks, outperforming baseline methods in knowledge incorporation and transfer learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filip Dorm, Christian Lange, Scott Loarie, Oisin Mac Aodha</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the geographic ranges of species is crucial for assisting conservation efforts. Traditionally, range maps were manually created by experts. However, species distribution models (SDMs) and, more recently, deep learning-based variants offer a potential automated alternative. Deep learning-based SDMs generate a continuous probability representing the predicted presence of a species at a given location, which must be binarized by setting per-species thresholds to obtain binary range maps. However, selecting appropriate per-species thresholds to binarize these predictions is non-trivial as different species can require distinct thresholds. In this work, we evaluate different approaches for automatically identifying the best thresholds for binarizing range maps using presence-only data. This includes approaches that require the generation of additional pseudo-absence data, along with ones that only require presence data. We also propose an extension of an existing presence-only technique that is more robust to outliers. We perform a detailed evaluation of different thresholding techniques on the tasks of binary range estimation and large-scale fine-grained visual classification, and we demonstrate improved performance over existing pseudo-absence free approaches using our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Dai, Enhui Zheng, Jiahao Chen, Lei Qi, Zhenhua Feng, Wankou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image retrieval (IR) has emerged as a promising approach for self-localization in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, IR-based methods face several challenges: 1) Pre- and post-processing incur significant computational and storage overhead; 2) The lack of interaction between dual-source features impairs precise spatial perception. In this paper, we propose an efficient heterogeneous spatial feature interaction method, termed Drone Referring Localization (DRL), which aims to localize UAV-view images within satellite imagery. Unlike conventional methods that treat different data sources in isolation, followed by cosine similarity computations, DRL facilitates the learnable interaction of heterogeneous features. To implement the proposed DRL, we design two transformer-based frameworks, Post-Fusion and Mix-Fusion, enabling end-to-end training and inference. Furthermore, we introduce random scale cropping and weight balance loss techniques to augment paired data and optimize the balance between positive and negative sample weights. Additionally, we construct a new dataset, UL14, and establish a benchmark tailored to the DRL framework. Compared to traditional IR methods, DRL achieves superior localization accuracy (MA@20 +9.4\%) while significantly reducing computational time (1/7) and storage overhead (1/3). The dataset and code will be made publicly available. The dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DRL} .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiu Lin, Samuel Yu, Zhiyi Kuang, Deepak Pathak, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to quickly learn a new task with minimal instruction - known as few-shot learning - is a central aspect of intelligent agents. Classical few-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but such samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In contrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently. In this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better ${\bf visual}$ dog classifier by ${\bf read}$ing about dogs and ${\bf listen}$ing to them bark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models such as CLIP learn cross-modal encoders that map different modalities to the same representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple strategy for ${\bf cross-modal}$ ${\bf adaptation}$: we treat examples from different modalities as additional few-shot examples. For example, by simply repurposing class names as an additional training sample, we trivially turn any n-shot learning problem into a (n+1)-shot problem. This allows us to produce SOTA results with embarrassingly simple linear classifiers. We show that our approach can be combined with existing methods such as prefix tuning, adapters, and classifier ensembling. Finally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct the first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal training to improve the performance of both image and audio classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new learning approach, Soft Conditional Prompt Learning (SCP), which leverages the strengths of prompt learning for aerial video action recognition. Our approach is designed to predict the action of each agent by helping the models focus on the descriptions or instructions associated with actions in the input videos for aerial/robot visual perception. Our formulation supports various prompts, including learnable prompts, auxiliary visual information, and large vision models to improve the recognition performance. We present a soft conditional prompt method that learns to dynamically generate prompts from a pool of prompt experts under different video inputs. By sharing the same objective with the task, our proposed SCP can optimize prompts that guide the model's predictions while explicitly learning input-invariant (prompt experts pool) and input-specific (data-dependent) prompt knowledge. In practice, we observe a 3.17-10.2% accuracy improvement on the aerial video datasets (Okutama, NECDrone), which consist of scenes with single-agent and multi-agent actions. We further evaluate our approach on ground camera videos to verify the effectiveness and generalization and achieve a 1.0-3.6% improvement on dataset SSV2. We integrate our method into the ROS2 as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artur Jesslen, Guofeng Zhang, Angtian Wang, Wufei Ma, Alan Yuille, Adam Kortylewski</p>
<p>Abstract: Discriminative models for object classification typically learn image-based representations that do not capture the compositional and 3D nature of objects. In this work, we show that explicitly integrating 3D compositional object representations into deep networks for image classification leads to a largely enhanced generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios. In particular, we introduce a novel architecture, referred to as NOVUM, that consists of a feature extractor and a neural object volume for every target object class. Each neural object volume is a composition of 3D Gaussians that emit feature vectors. This compositional object representation allows for a highly robust and fast estimation of the object class by independently matching the features of the 3D Gaussians of each category to features extracted from an input image. Additionally, the object pose can be estimated via inverse rendering of the corresponding neural object volume. To enable the classification of objects, the neural features at each 3D Gaussian are trained discriminatively to be distinct from (i) the features of 3D Gaussians in other categories, (ii) features of other 3D Gaussians of the same object, and (iii) the background features. Our experiments show that NOVUM offers intriguing advantages over standard architectures due to the 3D compositional structure of the object representation, namely: (1) An exceptional robustness across a spectrum of real-world and synthetic out-of-distribution shifts and (2) an enhanced human interpretability compared to standard models, all while maintaining real-time inference and a competitive accuracy on in-distribution data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Hu, Lin Gu, Qiyuan An, Mengliang Zhang, Liangchen Liu, Kazuma Kobayashi, Tatsuya Harada, Ronald M. Summers, Yingying Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: To contribute to automating the medical vision-language model, we propose a novel Chest-Xray Difference Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Given a pair of main and reference images, this task attempts to answer several questions on both diseases and, more importantly, the differences between them. This is consistent with the radiologist's diagnosis practice that compares the current image with the reference before concluding the report. We collect a new dataset, namely MIMIC-Diff-VQA, including 700,703 QA pairs from 164,324 pairs of main and reference images. Compared to existing medical VQA datasets, our questions are tailored to the Assessment-Diagnosis-Intervention-Evaluation treatment procedure used by clinical professionals. Meanwhile, we also propose a novel expert knowledge-aware graph representation learning model to address this task. The proposed baseline model leverages expert knowledge such as anatomical structure prior, semantic, and spatial knowledge to construct a multi-relationship graph, representing the image differences between two images for the image difference VQA task. The dataset and code can be found at https://github.com/Holipori/MIMIC-Diff-VQA. We believe this work would further push forward the medical vision language model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berthy T. Feng, Katherine L. Bouman</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a surrogate function for efficient yet principled use of score-based priors in Bayesian imaging. We consider ill-posed inverse imaging problems in which one aims for a clean image posterior given incomplete or noisy measurements. Since the measurements do not uniquely determine a true image, a prior is needed to constrain the solution space. Recent work turned score-based diffusion models into principled priors for solving ill-posed imaging problems by appealing to an ODE-based log-probability function. However, evaluating the ODE is computationally inefficient and inhibits posterior estimation of high-dimensional images. Our proposed surrogate prior is based on the evidence lower bound of a score-based diffusion model. We demonstrate the surrogate prior on variational inference for efficient approximate posterior sampling of large images. Compared to the exact prior in previous work, our surrogate accelerates optimization of the variational image distribution by at least two orders of magnitude. We also find that our principled approach gives more accurate posterior estimation than non-variational diffusion-based approaches that involve hyperparameter-tuning at inference. Our work establishes a practical path forward for using score-based diffusion models as general-purpose image priors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianliang Wu, Yaqing Ding, Lei Luo, Haobo Jiang, Shuo Gu, Chuanwei Zhou, Jin Xie, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point Cloud Registration (PCR) is a critical and challenging task in computer vision. One of the primary difficulties in PCR is identifying salient and meaningful points that exhibit consistent semantic and geometric properties across different scans. Previous methods have encountered challenges with ambiguous matching due to the similarity among patch blocks throughout the entire point cloud and the lack of consideration for efficient global geometric consistency. To address these issues, we propose a new framework that includes several novel techniques. Firstly, we introduce a semantic-aware geometric encoder that combines object-level and patch-level semantic information. This encoder significantly improves registration recall by reducing ambiguity in patch-level superpoint matching. Additionally, we incorporate a prior knowledge approach that utilizes an intrinsic shape signature to identify salient points. This enables us to extract the most salient super points and meaningful dense points in the scene. Secondly, we introduce an innovative transformer that encodes High-Order (HO) geometric features. These features are crucial for identifying salient points within initial overlap regions while considering global high-order geometric consistency. To optimize this high-order transformer further, we introduce an anchor node selection strategy. By encoding inter-frame triangle or polyhedron consistency features based on these anchor nodes, we can effectively learn high-order geometric features of salient super points. These high-order features are then propagated to dense points and utilized by a Sinkhorn matching module to identify key correspondences for successful registration. In our experiments conducted on well-known datasets such as 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and KITTI, our approach has shown promising results, highlighting the effectiveness of our novel method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Cherel, Andr\'es Almansa, Yann Gousseau, Alasdair Newson</p>
<p>Abstract: Video inpainting is the task of filling a region in a video in a visually convincing manner. It is very challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and the temporal consistency required for obtaining convincing results. Recently, diffusion models have shown impressive results in modeling complex data distributions, including images and videos. Such models remain nonetheless very expensive to train and to perform inference with, which strongly reduce their applicability to videos, and yields unreasonable computational loads. We show that in the case of video inpainting, thanks to the highly auto-similar nature of videos, the training data of a diffusion model can be restricted to the input video and still produce very satisfying results. This leads us to adopt an internal learning approach, which also allows us to greatly reduce the neural network size by about three orders of magnitude less than current diffusion models used for image inpainting. We also introduce a new method for efficient training and inference of diffusion models in the context of internal learning, by splitting the diffusion process into different learning intervals corresponding to different noise levels of the diffusion process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video inpainting method based purely on diffusion. Other methods require additional components such as optical flow estimation, which limits their performance in the case of dynamic textures and complex motions. We show qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating that our method reaches state of the art performance in the case of dynamic textures and complex dynamic backgrounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinjin Xu, Liwu Xu, Yuzhe Yang, Xiang Li, Fanyi Wang, Yanchun Xie, Yi-Jie Huang, Yaqian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial improvements in visual understanding, primarily driven by sophisticated modality alignment strategies. However, predominant approaches prioritize global or regional comprehension, with less focus on fine-grained, pixel-level tasks. To address this gap, we introduce u-LLaVA, an innovative unifying multi-task framework that integrates pixel, regional, and global features to refine the perceptual faculties of MLLMs. We commence by leveraging an efficient modality alignment approach, harnessing both image and video datasets to bolster the model's foundational understanding across diverse visual contexts. Subsequently, a joint instruction tuning method with task-specific projectors and decoders for end-to-end downstream training is presented. Furthermore, this work contributes a novel mask-based multi-task dataset comprising 277K samples, crafted to challenge and assess the fine-grained perception capabilities of MLLMs. The overall framework is simple, effective, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We also make our model, data, and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/OPPOMKLab/u-LLaVA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihong Zhang, Runzhao Yang, Jinli Suo, Yuxiao Cheng, Qionghai Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for compact cameras capable of recording high-speed scenes with high resolution is steadily increasing. However, achieving such capabilities often entails high bandwidth requirements, resulting in bulky, heavy systems unsuitable for low-capacity platforms. To address this challenge, leveraging a coded exposure setup to encode a frame sequence into a blurry snapshot and subsequently retrieve the latent sharp video presents a lightweight solution. Nevertheless, restoring motion from blur remains a formidable challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of motion blur decomposition, the intrinsic ambiguity in motion direction, and the diverse motions present in natural videos. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by combining the classical coded exposure imaging technique with the emerging implicit neural representation for videos. We strategically embed motion direction cues into the blurry image during the imaging process. Additionally, we develop a novel implicit neural representation based blur decomposition network to sequentially extract the latent video frames from the blurry image, leveraging the embedded motion direction cues. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments using benchmark datasets and real-captured blurry images. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both quality and flexibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Tristram, Stefano Gasperini, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent neural rendering and reconstruction techniques, such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splatting, have shown remarkable novel view synthesis capabilities but require hundreds of images of the scene from diverse viewpoints to render high-quality novel views. With fewer images available, these methods start to fail since they can no longer correctly triangulate the underlying 3D geometry and converge to a non-optimal solution. These failures can manifest as floaters or blurry renderings in sparsely observed areas of the scene. In this paper, we propose Re-Nerfing, a simple and general add-on approach that leverages novel view synthesis itself to tackle this problem. Using an already trained NVS method, we render novel views between existing ones and augment the training data to optimize a second model. This introduces additional multi-view constraints and allows the second model to converge to a better solution. With Re-Nerfing we achieve significant improvements upon multiple pipelines based on NeRF and Gaussian-Splatting in sparse view settings of the mip-NeRF 360 and LLFF datasets. Notably, Re-Nerfing does not require prior knowledge or extra supervision signals, making it a flexible and practical add-on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangquan Feng, Junhua Ma, Virginia R. de Sa</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have proposed to use data of human preference feedback to fine-tune text-to-image generative models. However, the scalability of human feedback collection has been limited by its reliance on manual annotation. Therefore, we develop and test a method to automatically score user preferences from their spontaneous facial expression reaction to the generated images. We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images (FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are highly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images. We develop an FAU-Net (Facial Action Units Neural Network), which receives inputs from an AU estimation model, to automatically score user preferences for text-to-image generation based on their facial expression reactions, which is complementary to the pre-trained scoring models based on the input text prompts and generated images. Integrating our FAU-Net valence score with the pre-trained scoring models improves their consistency with human preferences. This method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be potentially generalized to other generation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ShuangquanFeng/FERGI, and the dataset is also available at the same link for research purposes.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the percentage of elderly people in developed countries increases worldwide, the healthcare of this collective is a worrying matter, especially if it includes the preservation of their autonomy. In this direction, many studies are being published on Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems, which help to reduce the preoccupations raised by the independent living of the elderly. In this study, a systematic review of the literature is presented on fall detection and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) for the elderly, as the two main tasks to solve to guarantee the safety of elderly people living alone. To address the current tendency to perform these two tasks, the review focuses on the use of Deep Learning (DL) based approaches on computer vision data. In addition, different collections of data like DL models, datasets or hardware (e.g. depth or thermal cameras) are gathered from the reviewed studies and provided for reference in future studies. Strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches are also discussed and, based on them, our recommendations for future works are provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> F. Xavier Gaya-Morey, Silvia Ramis-Guarinos, Cristina Manresa-Yee, Jose M. Buades-Rubio</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expression recognition is vital for human behavior analysis, and deep learning has enabled models that can outperform humans. However, it is unclear how closely they mimic human processing. This study aims to explore the similarity between deep neural networks and human perception by comparing twelve different networks, including both general object classifiers and FER-specific models. We employ an innovative global explainable AI method to generate heatmaps, revealing crucial facial regions for the twelve networks trained on six facial expressions. We assess these results both quantitatively and qualitatively, comparing them to ground truth masks based on Friesen and Ekman's description and among them. We use Intersection over Union (IoU) and normalized correlation coefficients for comparisons. We generate 72 heatmaps to highlight critical regions for each expression and architecture. Qualitatively, models with pre-trained weights show more similarity in heatmaps compared to those without pre-training. Specifically, eye and nose areas influence certain facial expressions, while the mouth is consistently important across all models and expressions. Quantitatively, we find low average IoU values (avg. 0.2702) across all expressions and architectures. The best-performing architecture averages 0.3269, while the worst-performing one averages 0.2066. Dendrograms, built with the normalized correlation coefficient, reveal two main clusters for most expressions: models with pre-training and models without pre-training. Findings suggest limited alignment between human and AI facial expression recognition, with network architectures influencing the similarity, as similar architectures prioritize similar facial regions.</p>

Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed frame selection module improves the performance of the framework significantly. We validate the performance of the proposed VidTFS on four widely used video datasets, including CrossTask, COIN, UCF101, and ActivityNet, covering goal inference and action recognition tasks under open-vocabulary settings without requiring any training or fine-tuning. The results show that VidTFS outperforms pretrained and instruction-tuned multimodal language models that directly stack LLM and VFM for downstream video inference tasks. Our VidTFS with its adaptability shows the future potential for generalizing to new training-free video inference tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biometric authentication systems play a crucial role in modern security systems. However, maintaining the balance of privacy and integrity of stored biometrics derivative data while achieving high recognition accuracy is often challenging. Addressing this issue, we introduce an innovative image transformation technique that effectively renders facial images unrecognizable to the eye while maintaining their identifiability by neural network models, which allows the distorted photo version to be stored for further verification. While initially intended for biometrics systems, the proposed methodology can be used in various artificial intelligence applications to distort the visual data and keep the derived features close. By experimenting with widely used datasets LFW and MNIST, we show that it is possible to build the distortion that changes the image content by more than 70% while maintaining the same recognition accuracy. We compare our method with previously state-of-the-art approaches. We publically release the source code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piero Fraternali, Luca Morandini, Sergio Luis Herrera Gonz\'alez</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection and characterization of illegal solid waste disposal sites are essential for environmental protection, particularly for mitigating pollution and health hazards. Improperly managed landfills contaminate soil and groundwater via rainwater infiltration, posing threats to both animals and humans. Traditional landfill identification approaches, such as on-site inspections, are time-consuming and expensive. Remote sensing is a cost-effective solution for the identification and monitoring of solid waste disposal sites that enables broad coverage and repeated acquisitions over time. Earth Observation (EO) satellites, equipped with an array of sensors and imaging capabilities, have been providing high-resolution data for several decades. Researchers proposed specialized techniques that leverage remote sensing imagery to perform a range of tasks such as waste site detection, dumping site monitoring, and assessment of suitable locations for new landfills. This review aims to provide a detailed illustration of the most relevant proposals for the detection and monitoring of solid waste sites by describing and comparing the approaches, the implemented techniques, and the employed data. Furthermore, since the data sources are of the utmost importance for developing an effective solid waste detection model, a comprehensive overview of the satellites and publicly available data sets is presented. Finally, this paper identifies the open issues in the state-of-the-art and discusses the relevant research directions for reducing the costs and improving the effectiveness of novel solid waste detection methods.</p>

We also find that the discriminator systematically stratifies scores by both image- and face-level qualities and that this disproportionately affects images across gender, race, and other categories.

<p>Abstract: Image customization has been extensively studied in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, leading to impressive outcomes and applications. With the emergence of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, its temporal counterpart, motion customization, has not yet been well investigated. To address the challenge of one-shot video motion customization, we propose Customize-A-Video that models the motion from a single reference video and adapts it to new subjects and scenes with both spatial and temporal varieties. It leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on temporal attention layers to tailor the pre-trained T2V diffusion model for specific motion modeling. To disentangle the spatial and temporal information during training, we introduce a novel concept of appearance absorbers that detach the original appearance from the reference video prior to motion learning. The proposed modules are trained in a staged pipeline and inferred in a plug-and-play fashion, enabling easy extensions to various downstream tasks such as custom video generation and editing, video appearance customization and multiple motion combination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Xuan, Yufei Xu, Shanshan Zhao, Chaoyue Wang, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: ControlNet excels at creating content that closely matches precise contours in user-provided masks. However, when these masks contain noise, as a frequent occurrence with non-expert users, the output would include unwanted artifacts. This paper first highlights the crucial role of controlling the impact of these inexplicit masks with diverse deterioration levels through in-depth analysis. Subsequently, to enhance controllability with inexplicit masks, an advanced Shape-aware ControlNet consisting of a deterioration estimator and a shape-prior modulation block is devised. The deterioration estimator assesses the deterioration factor of the provided masks. Then this factor is utilized in the modulation block to adaptively modulate the model's contour-following ability, which helps it dismiss the noise part in the inexplicit masks. Extensive experiments prove its effectiveness in encouraging ControlNet to interpret inaccurate spatial conditions robustly rather than blindly following the given contours. We showcase application scenarios like modifying shape priors and composable shape-controllable generation. Codes are soon available.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of chemical structure recognition, the task of converting molecular images into machine-readable data formats such as SMILES string stands as a significant challenge, primarily due to the varied drawing styles and conventions prevalent in chemical literature. To bridge this gap, we proposed MolNexTR, a novel image-to-graph deep learning model that collaborates to fuse the strengths of ConvNext, a powerful Convolutional Neural Network variant, and Vision-TRansformer. This integration facilitates a more detailed extraction of both local and global features from molecular images. MolNexTR can predict atoms and bonds simultaneously and understand their layout rules. It also excels at flexibly integrating symbolic chemistry principles to discern chirality and decipher abbreviated structures. We further incorporate a series of advanced algorithms, including an improved data augmentation module, an image contamination module, and a post-processing module for getting the final SMILES output. These modules cooperate to enhance the model's robustness to diverse styles of molecular images found in real literature. In our test sets, MolNexTR has demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 81-97%, marking a significant advancement in the domain of molecular structure recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: User Interface (UI) understanding has been an increasingly popular topic over the last few years. So far, there has been a vast focus solely on web and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce the harder task of computer UI understanding. With the goal of enabling research in this field, we have generated a dataset with a set of videos where a user is performing a sequence of actions and each image shows the desktop contents at that time point. We also present a framework that is composed of a synthetic sample generation pipeline to augment the dataset with relevant characteristics, and a contrastive learning method to classify images in the videos. We take advantage of the natural conditional, tree-like, relationship of the images' characteristics to regularize the learning of the representations by dealing with multiple partial tasks simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms previously proposed hierarchical multi-label contrastive losses in fine-grain UI classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kutay Y{\i}lmaz, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner, Anastasiia Kornilova, Alexey Artemov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been achieved in sensing real large-scale outdoor 3D environments, particularly by using modern acquisition equipment such as LiDAR sensors. Unfortunately, they are fundamentally limited in their ability to produce dense, complete 3D scenes. To address this issue, recent learning-based methods integrate neural implicit representations and optimizable feature grids to approximate surfaces of 3D scenes. However, naively fitting samples along raw LiDAR rays leads to noisy 3D mapping results due to the nature of sparse, conflicting LiDAR measurements. Instead, in this work we depart from fitting LiDAR data exactly, instead letting the network optimize a non-metric monotonic implicit field defined in 3D space. To fit our field, we design a learning system integrating a monotonicity loss that enables optimizing neural monotonic fields and leverages recent progress in large-scale 3D mapping. Our algorithm achieves high-quality dense 3D mapping performance as captured by multiple quantitative and perceptual measures and visual results obtained for Mai City, Newer College, and KITTI benchmarks. The code of our approach will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namhyuk Ahn, Wonhyuk Ahn, KiYoon Yoo, Daesik Kim, Seung-Hun Nam</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has profoundly enhanced the fidelity of image generation, but it has raised concerns about copyright infringements. While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhi Wang, Feng Zhou, Bo yu, Pu Cao, Jianqin Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction technologies have paved the way for high-quality and real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes. Despite these achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a novel 3D target segmentation technique based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which segments 3D consistent target masks in multi-view scene images and generates a preliminary target model. Moreover, to reconstruct the unseen portions of the target, we propose a novel target replenishment technique driven by large-scale generative diffusion priors. We demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct specific targets from large scenes, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our experiments show that OMEGAS significantly outperforms existing reconstruction methods across various scenarios. Our project page is at: https://github.com/CrystalWlz/OMEGAS</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuankun Yang, Li Zhang, Ziyang Xie, Zhiyuan Yuan, Jianfeng Feng, Xiatian Zhu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the hidden mechanisms behind human's visual perception is a fundamental question in neuroscience. To that end, investigating into the neural responses of human mind activities, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has been a significant research vehicle. However, analyzing fMRI signals is challenging, costly, daunting, and demanding for professional training. Despite remarkable progress in fMRI analysis, existing approaches are limited to generating 2D images and far away from being biologically meaningful and practically useful. Under this insight, we propose to generate visually plausible and functionally more comprehensive 3D outputs decoded from brain signals, enabling more sophisticated modeling of fMRI data. Conceptually, we reformulate this task as a {\em fMRI conditioned 3D object generation} problem. We design a novel 3D object representation learning method, Brain3D, that takes as input the fMRI data of a subject who was presented with a 2D image, and yields as output the corresponding 3D object images. The key capabilities of this model include tackling the noises with high-level semantic signals and a two-stage architecture design for progressive high-level information integration. Extensive experiments validate the superior capability of our model over previous state-of-the-art 3D object generation methods. Importantly, we show that our model captures the distinct functionalities of each region of human vision system as well as their intricate interplay relationships, aligning remarkably with the established discoveries in neuroscience. Further, preliminary evaluations indicate that Brain3D can successfully identify the disordered brain regions in simulated scenarios, such as V1, V2, V3, V4, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) within the human visual system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vu Minh Hieu Phan, Yutong Xie, Bowen Zhang, Yuankai Qi, Zhibin Liao, Antonios Perperidis, Son Lam Phung, Johan W. Verjans, Minh-Son To</p>
<p>Abstract: Unpaired medical image synthesis aims to provide complementary information for an accurate clinical diagnostics, and address challenges in obtaining aligned multi-modal medical scans. Transformer-based models excel in imaging translation tasks thanks to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. Although effective in supervised training settings, their performance falters in unpaired image synthesis, particularly in synthesizing structural details. This paper empirically demonstrates that, lacking strong inductive biases, Transformer can converge to non-optimal solutions in the absence of paired data. To address this, we introduce UNet Structured Transformer (UNest), a novel architecture incorporating structural inductive biases for unpaired medical image synthesis. We leverage the foundational Segment-Anything Model to precisely extract the foreground structure and perform structural attention within the main anatomy. This guides the model to learn key anatomical regions, thus improving structural synthesis under the lack of supervision in unpaired training. Evaluated on two public datasets, spanning three modalities, i.e., MR, CT, and PET, UNest improves recent methods by up to 19.30% across six medical image synthesis tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentong Li, Yuqian Yuan, Jian Liu, Dongqi Tang, Song Wang, Jie Qin, Jianke Zhu, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The visual projector serves as an essential bridge between the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) in a Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Typically, MLLMs adopt a simple MLP to preserve all visual contexts via one-to-one transformation. However, the visual tokens are redundant and can be considerably increased when dealing with high-resolution images, impairing the efficiency of MLLMs significantly. Some recent works have introduced resampler or abstractor to reduce the number of resulting visual tokens. Unfortunately, they fail to capture finer details and undermine the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. In this work, we propose a novel visual projector, which adopts a coarse-to-fine scheme to inject the enriched characteristics to generate the condensed visual tokens. In specific, we first interpolate the visual features as a low-resolution point query, providing the overall visual representation as the foundation. Then, we introduce a region-to-point injection module that utilizes high-resolution, multi-level region-based cues as fine-grained reference keys and values, allowing them to be fully absorbed within the corresponding local context region. This step effectively updates the coarse point query, transforming it into an enriched one for the subsequent LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach compresses the visual tokens by 75%~89%, while achieves comparable or even better performance across diverse benchmarks with significantly higher efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Di Sario, Riccardo Renzulli, Enzo Tartaglione, Marco Grangetto</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the introduction of NeRFs, considerable attention has been focused on improving their training and inference times, leading to the development of Fast-NeRFs models. Despite demonstrating impressive rendering speed and quality, the rapid convergence of such models poses challenges for further improving reconstruction quality. Common strategies to improve rendering quality involves augmenting model parameters or increasing the number of sampled points. However, these computationally intensive approaches encounter limitations in achieving significant quality enhancements. This study introduces a model-agnostic framework inspired by Sparsely-Gated Mixture of Experts to enhance rendering quality without escalating computational complexity. Our approach enables specialization in rendering different scene components by employing a mixture of experts with varying resolutions. We present a novel gate formulation designed to maximize expert capabilities and propose a resolution-based routing technique to effectively induce sparsity and decompose scenes. Our work significantly improves reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep supervised models possess significant capability to assimilate extensive training data, thereby presenting an opportunity to enhance model performance through training on multiple datasets. However, conflicts arising from different label spaces among datasets may adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically construct a unified label space across multiple datasets using graph neural networks. This enables semantic segmentation models to be trained simultaneously on multiple datasets, resulting in performance improvements. Unlike existing methods, our approach facilitates seamless training without the need for additional manual reannotation or taxonomy reconciliation. This significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-dataset segmentation model training. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other multi-dataset training methods when trained on seven datasets simultaneously, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildDash 2 benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsung Lee, Taeoh Kim, Inwoong Lee, Minho Shim, Dongyoon Wee, Minsu Cho, Suha Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Video action detection (VAD) aims to detect actors and classify their actions in a video. We figure that VAD suffers more from classification rather than localization of actors. Hence, we analyze how prevailing methods form features for classification and find that they prioritize actor regions, yet often overlooking the essential contextual information necessary for accurate classification. Accordingly, we propose to reduce the bias toward actor and encourage paying attention to the context that is relevant to each action class. By assigning a class-dedicated query to each action class, our model can dynamically determine where to focus for effective classification. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance on three challenging benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters and less computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Wolfe, Aayushi Dangol, Alexis Hiniker, Bill Howe</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal AI models capable of associating images and text hold promise for numerous domains, ranging from automated image captioning to accessibility applications for blind and low-vision users. However, uncertainty about bias has in some cases limited their adoption and availability. In the present work, we study 43 CLIP vision-language models to determine whether they learn human-like facial impression biases, and we find evidence that such biases are reflected across three distinct CLIP model families. We show for the first time that the the degree to which a bias is shared across a society predicts the degree to which it is reflected in a CLIP model. Human-like impressions of visually unobservable attributes, like trustworthiness and sexuality, emerge only in models trained on the largest dataset, indicating that a better fit to uncurated cultural data results in the reproduction of increasingly subtle social biases. Moreover, we use a hierarchical clustering approach to show that dataset size predicts the extent to which the underlying structure of facial impression bias resembles that of facial impression bias in humans. Finally, we show that Stable Diffusion models employing CLIP as a text encoder learn facial impression biases, and that these biases intersect with racial biases in Stable Diffusion XL-Turbo. While pretrained CLIP models may prove useful for scientific studies of bias, they will also require significant dataset curation when intended for use as general-purpose models in a zero-shot setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongtong Feng, Qing Li, Xin Wang, Mingzi Wang, Guangyao Li, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization in GNSS-denied environments aims to determine an unknown location by matching drone-view images with the correct geo-tagged satellite-view images from a large gallery. Recent research shows that learning discriminative image representations under specific weather conditions can significantly enhance performance. However, the frequent occurrence of unseen extreme weather conditions hinders progress. This paper introduces MCGF, a Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Framework designed to dynamically adapt to unseen weather conditions. MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing. Extensive experiments on University160k-WX demonstrate that MCGF achieves competitive results for geo-localization in varying weather conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhang Jin, Jian Li, Jiangning Zhang, Jianlong Hu, Zhenye Gan, Xin Tan, Yong Liu, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Spatial Description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relationships between objects within images. Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Cao, Yi Cao, Li Pang, Deyu Meng, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover a high-quality clean image from its degraded version. Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different degradation types, thus forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a \textbf{H}ypernetworks-based \textbf{A}ll-in-One \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration method that dynamically generates parameters based on input images. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and all-in-one settings. Notably, our innovative model, Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to the prevalent All-in-One methodologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zohaib Khan, Muhammad Khaquan, Omer Tafveez, Burhanuddin Samiwala, Agha Ali Raza</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning through its Self-Attention mechanism, which effectively captures contextual information. However, the memory footprint of Self-Attention presents significant challenges for long-sequence tasks. Grouped Query Attention (GQA) addresses this issue by grouping queries and mean-pooling the corresponding key-value heads - reducing the number of overall parameters and memory requirements in a flexible manner without adversely compromising model accuracy. In this work, we introduce enhancements to GQA, focusing on two novel approaches that deviate from the static nature of grouping: Key-Distributed GQA (KDGQA) and Dynamic Key-Distributed GQA (DGQA), which leverage information from the norms of the key heads to inform query allocation. Specifically, KDGQA looks at the ratios of the norms of the key heads during each forward pass, while DGQA examines the ratios of the norms as they evolve through training. Additionally, we present Perturbed GQA (PGQA) as a case-study, which introduces variability in (static) group formation via subtracting noise from the attention maps. Our experiments with up-trained Vision Transformers, for Image Classification on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Food101, and Tiny ImageNet, demonstrate the promise of these variants in improving upon the original GQA through more informed and adaptive grouping mechanisms: specifically ViT-L experiences accuracy gains of up to 8% when utilizing DGQA in comparison to GQA and other variants. We further analyze the impact of the number of Key-Value Heads on performance, underscoring the importance of utilizing query-key affinities. Code is available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a geometry-aware semi-supervised method for fine-grained building function recognition. This method leverages the geometric relationships between multi-source data to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels in semi-supervised learning, extending the task's scope and making it applicable to cross-categorization systems of building function recognition. Firstly, we design an online semi-supervised pre-training stage, which facilitates the precise acquisition of building facade location information in street-view images. In the second stage, we propose a geometry-aware coarse annotation generation module. This module effectively combines GIS data and street-view data based on the geometric relationships, improving the accuracy of pseudo annotations. In the third stage, we combine the newly generated coarse annotations with the existing labeled dataset to achieve fine-grained functional recognition of buildings across multiple cities at a large scale. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits superior performance in fine-grained functional recognition of buildings. Within the same categorization system, it achieves improvements of 7.6% and 4.8% compared to fully-supervised methods and state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, respectively. Additionally, our method also performs well in cross-city tasks, i.e., extending the model trained on OmniCity (New York) to new areas (i.e., Los Angeles and Boston). This study provides a novel solution for the fine-grained function recognition of large-scale buildings across multiple cities, offering essential data for understanding urban infrastructure planning, human activity patterns, and the interactions between humans and buildings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data classification poses significant challenges due to the common issue of missing views in real-world scenarios. Despite advancements, existing methods often fail to provide reliable predictions, largely due to the uncertainty of missing views and the inconsistent quality of imputed data. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework called Evidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification (EDP-MVC). Initially, we use K-means imputation to address missing views, creating a complete set of multi-view data. However, the potential conflicts and uncertainties within this imputed data can affect the reliability of downstream inferences. To manage this, we introduce a Conflict-Aware Evidential Fusion Network (CAEFN), which dynamically adjusts based on the reliability of the evidence, ensuring trustworthy discount fusion and producing reliable inference outcomes. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets reveal EDP-MVC not only matches but often surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance of anomaly inspection in industrial manufacturing is constrained by the scarcity of anomaly data. To overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. However, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. In this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. We propose DualAnoDiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. Moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both realism and diversity. Overall, our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream anomaly detection tasks, including anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and anomaly classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Smart, Chuanxia Zheng, Iro Laina, Victor Adrian Prisacariu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Splatt3R, a pose-free, feed-forward method for in-the-wild 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from stereo pairs. Given uncalibrated natural images, Splatt3R can predict 3D Gaussian Splats without requiring any camera parameters or depth information. For generalizability, we build Splatt3R upon a ``foundation'' 3D geometry reconstruction method, MASt3R, by extending it to deal with both 3D structure and appearance. Specifically, unlike the original MASt3R which reconstructs only 3D point clouds, we predict the additional Gaussian attributes required to construct a Gaussian primitive for each point. Hence, unlike other novel view synthesis methods, Splatt3R is first trained by optimizing the 3D point cloud's geometry loss, and then a novel view synthesis objective. By doing this, we avoid the local minima present in training 3D Gaussian Splats from stereo views. We also propose a novel loss masking strategy that we empirically find is critical for strong performance on extrapolated viewpoints. We train Splatt3R on the ScanNet++ dataset and demonstrate excellent generalisation to uncalibrated, in-the-wild images. Splatt3R can reconstruct scenes at 4FPS at 512 x 512 resolution, and the resultant splats can be rendered in real-time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewoo Kim, Hoonhee Cho, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Video deblurring aims to enhance the quality of restored results in motion-blurred videos by effectively gathering information from adjacent video frames to compensate for the insufficient data in a single blurred frame. However, when faced with consecutively severe motion blur situations, frame-based video deblurring methods often fail to find accurate temporal correspondence among neighboring video frames, leading to diminished performance. To address this limitation, we aim to solve the video deblurring task by leveraging an event camera with micro-second temporal resolution. To fully exploit the dense temporal resolution of the event camera, we propose two modules: 1) Intra-frame feature enhancement operates within the exposure time of a single blurred frame, iteratively enhancing cross-modality features in a recurrent manner to better utilize the rich temporal information of events, 2) Inter-frame temporal feature alignment gathers valuable long-range temporal information to target frames, aggregating sharp features leveraging the advantages of the events. In addition, we present a novel dataset composed of real-world blurred RGB videos, corresponding sharp videos, and event data. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for evaluating event-guided deblurring methods. We demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art frame-based and event-based motion deblurring methods through extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world deblurring datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhui Liao, Jiapeng Wang, Hongliang Li, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Lianwen Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-rich document understanding (TDU) refers to analyzing and comprehending documents containing substantial textual content. With the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), they have been widely leveraged for TDU due to their remarkable versatility and generalization. In this paper, we introduce DocLayLLM, an efficient and effective multi-modal extension of LLMs specifically designed for TDU. By integrating visual patch tokens and 2D positional tokens into LLMs and encoding the document content using the LLMs themselves, we fully take advantage of the document comprehension capability of LLMs and enhance their perception of OCR information. We have also deeply considered the role of the chain-of-thought (CoT) and innovatively proposed the techniques of CoT Pre-training and CoT Annealing. Our DocLayLLM can achieve remarkable performances with lightweight training settings, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our DocLayLLM surpasses existing OCR-dependent methods and also outperforms OCR-free competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunpeng Wang, Danying Lin, Chenglong Li, Zhengzheng Tu, Bin Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Although most existing multi-modal salient object detection (SOD) methods demonstrate effectiveness through training models from scratch, the limited multi-modal data hinders these methods from reaching optimality. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to explore and exploit the powerful feature representation and zero-shot generalization ability of the pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multi-modal SOD. Despite serving as a recent vision fundamental model, driving the class-agnostic SAM to comprehend and detect salient objects accurately is non-trivial, especially in challenging scenes. To this end, we develop \underline{SAM} with se\underline{m}antic f\underline{e}ature fu\underline{s}ion guidanc\underline{e} (Sammese), which incorporates multi-modal saliency-specific knowledge into SAM to adapt SAM to multi-modal SOD tasks. However, it is difficult for SAM trained on single-modal data to directly mine the complementary benefits of multi-modal inputs and comprehensively utilize them to achieve accurate saliency prediction.To address these issues, we first design a multi-modal complementary fusion module to extract robust multi-modal semantic features by integrating information from visible and thermal or depth image pairs. Then, we feed the extracted multi-modal semantic features into both the SAM image encoder and mask decoder for fine-tuning and prompting, respectively. Specifically, in the image encoder, a multi-modal adapter is proposed to adapt the single-modal SAM to multi-modal information. In the mask decoder, a semantic-geometric prompt generation strategy is proposed to produce corresponding embeddings with various saliency cues. Extensive experiments on both RGB-D and RGB-T SOD benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Mustafa, Muhammad Tahir Rafique, Muhammad Ijlal Baig, Hasan Sajid, Muhammad Jawad Khan, Karam Dad Kallu</p>
<p>Abstract: This research paper presents a novel word-level Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model developed specifically for digital Urdu text. The model utilizes transformer-based architectures and attention mechanisms to address the unique challenges of recognizing Urdu script, which includes handling a diverse range of text styles, fonts, and variations. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of approximately 160,000 Urdu text images, the model incorporates a permuted autoregressive sequence (PARSeq) architecture. This design enables context-aware inference and iterative refinement by leveraging bidirectional context information, significantly enhancing its ability to accurately recognize Urdu characters. The model achieves a character error rate (CER) of 0.178, highlighting its effectiveness and precision in real-world applications. However, the model has some limitations, such as difficulties with blurred images, non-horizontal orientations, and the presence of trailing punctuation marks, which can introduce noise into the recognition process. Addressing these challenges will be a key focus of future work. Future research will aim to further refine the model through advanced data augmentation techniques, optimization of hyperparameters, and the integration of context-aware language models, ultimately enhancing the model's performance and robustness in Urdu text recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Du, Conor Durkan, Robin Strudel, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Sander Dieleman, Rob Fergus, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Arnaud Doucet, Will Grathwohl</p>
<p>Abstract: Since their introduction, diffusion models have quickly become the prevailing approach to generative modeling in many domains. They can be interpreted as learning the gradients of a time-varying sequence of log-probability density functions. This interpretation has motivated classifier-based and classifier-free guidance as methods for post-hoc control of diffusion models. In this work, we build upon these ideas using the score-based interpretation of diffusion models, and explore alternative ways to condition, modify, and reuse diffusion models for tasks involving compositional generation and guidance. In particular, we investigate why certain types of composition fail using current techniques and present a number of solutions. We conclude that the sampler (not the model) is responsible for this failure and propose new samplers, inspired by MCMC, which enable successful compositional generation. Further, we propose an energy-based parameterization of diffusion models which enables the use of new compositional operators and more sophisticated, Metropolis-corrected samplers. Intriguingly we find these samplers lead to notable improvements in compositional generation across a wide set of problems such as classifier-guided ImageNet modeling and compositional text-to-image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Fontana, Michael Spratling, Miaojing Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims to learn multiple tasks simultaneously while exploiting their mutual relationships. By using shared resources to simultaneously calculate multiple outputs, this learning paradigm has the potential to have lower memory requirements and inference times compared to the traditional approach of using separate methods for each task. Previous work in MTL has mainly focused on fully-supervised methods, as task relationships can not only be leveraged to lower the level of data-dependency of those methods but they can also improve performance. However, MTL introduces a set of challenges due to a complex optimisation scheme and a higher labeling requirement. This review focuses on how MTL could be utilised under different partial supervision settings to address these challenges. First, this review analyses how MTL traditionally uses different parameter sharing techniques to transfer knowledge in between tasks. Second, it presents the different challenges arising from such a multi-objective optimisation scheme. Third, it introduces how task groupings can be achieved by analysing task relationships. Fourth, it focuses on how partially supervised methods applied to MTL can tackle the aforementioned challenges. Lastly, this review presents the available datasets, tools and benchmarking results of such methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shutong Jin, Ruiyu Wang, Muhammad Zahid, Florian T. Pokorny</p>
<p>Abstract: As model and dataset sizes continue to scale in robot learning, the need to understand how the composition and properties of a dataset affect model performance becomes increasingly urgent to ensure cost-effective data collection and model performance. In this work, we empirically investigate how physics attributes (color, friction coefficient, shape) and scene background characteristics, such as the complexity and dynamics of interactions with background objects, influence the performance of Video Transformers in predicting planar pushing trajectories. We investigate three primary questions: How do physics attributes and background scene characteristics influence model performance? What kind of changes in attributes are most detrimental to model generalization? What proportion of fine-tuning data is required to adapt models to novel scenarios? To facilitate this research, we present CloudGripper-Push-1K, a large real-world vision-based robot pushing dataset comprising 1278 hours and 460,000 videos of planar pushing interactions with objects with different physics and background attributes. We also propose Video Occlusion Transformer (VOT), a generic modular video-transformer-based trajectory prediction framework which features 3 choices of 2D-spatial encoders as the subject of our case study.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Sun, Zihui Wu, Yifan Chen, Berthy T. Feng, Katherine L. Bouman</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating high-quality images while also quantifying their uncertainty are two desired features in an image reconstruction algorithm for solving ill-posed inverse problems. In this paper, we propose plug-and-play Monte Carlo (PMC) as a principled framework for characterizing the space of possible solutions to a general inverse problem. PMC is able to incorporate expressive score-based generative priors for high-quality image reconstruction while also performing uncertainty quantification via posterior sampling. In particular, we develop two PMC algorithms that can be viewed as the sampling analogues of the traditional plug-and-play priors (PnP) and regularization by denoising (RED) algorithms. To improve the sampling efficiency, we introduce weighted annealing into these PMC algorithms, further developing two additional annealed PMC algorithms (APMC). We establish a theoretical analysis for characterizing the convergence behavior of PMC algorithms. Our analysis provides non-asymptotic stationarity guarantees in terms of the Fisher information, fully compatible with the joint presence of weighted annealing, potentially non-log-concave likelihoods, and imperfect score networks. We demonstrate the performance of the PMC algorithms on multiple representative inverse problems with both linear and nonlinear forward models. Experimental results show that PMC significantly improves reconstruction quality and enables high-fidelity uncertainty quantification.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, a novel approach for merging 3D point cloud maps in the context of egocentric multi-robot exploration is presented. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed approach leverages state-of-the-art place recognition and learned descriptors to efficiently detect overlap between maps, eliminating the need for the time-consuming global feature extraction and feature matching process. The estimated overlapping regions are used to calculate a homogeneous rigid transform, which serves as an initial condition for the GICP point cloud registration algorithm to refine the alignment between the maps. The advantages of this approach include faster processing time, improved accuracy, and increased robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is successfully demonstrated through multiple field missions of robot exploration in a variety of different underground environments.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14568">Policy Gradient-Driven Noise Mask</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Can Yavuz, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance.
  In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models.
  We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Gu, Yoshito Otake, Keisuke Uemura, Masaki Takao, Mazen Soufi, Seiji Okada, Nobuhiko Sugano, Hugues Talbot, Yoshinobu Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: While most vision tasks are essentially visual in nature (for recognition), some important tasks, especially in the medical field, also require quantitative analysis (for quantification) using quantitative images. Unlike in visual analysis, pixel values in quantitative images correspond to physical metrics measured by specific devices (e.g., a depth image). However, recent work has shown that it is sometimes possible to synthesize accurate quantitative values from visual ones (e.g., depth from visual cues or defocus). This research aims to improve quantitative image synthesis (QIS) by exploring pretraining and image resolution scaling. We propose a benchmark for evaluating pretraining performance using the task of QIS-based bone mineral density (BMD) estimation from plain X-ray images, where the synthesized quantitative image is used to derive BMD. Our results show that appropriate pretraining can improve QIS performance, significantly raising the correlation of BMD estimation from 0.820 to 0.898, while others do not help or even hinder it. Scaling-up the resolution can further boost the correlation up to 0.923, a significant enhancement over conventional methods. Future work will include exploring more pretraining strategies and validating them on other image synthesis tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a crucial task in the development of video compression standards, as it directly impacts the viewer experience. This paper presents the results of the Compressed Video Quality Assessment challenge, held in conjunction with the Advances in Image Manipulation (AIM) workshop at ECCV 2024. The challenge aimed to evaluate the performance of VQA methods on a diverse dataset of 459 videos, encoded with 14 codecs of various compression standards (AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, AV1, and VVC/H.266) and containing a comprehensive collection of compression artifacts. To measure the methods performance, we employed traditional correlation coefficients between their predictions and subjective scores, which were collected via large-scale crowdsourced pairwise human comparisons. For training purposes, participants were provided with the Compressed Video Quality Assessment Dataset (CVQAD), a previously developed dataset of 1022 videos. Up to 30 participating teams registered for the challenge, while we report the results of 6 teams, which submitted valid final solutions and code for reproducing the results. Moreover, we calculated and present the performance of state-of-the-art VQA methods on the developed dataset, providing a comprehensive benchmark for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ardhendu Sekhar, Vrinda Goel, Garima Jain, Abhijeet Patil, Ravi Kant Gupta, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: The current standard for detecting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer patients relies on HER2 amplification, identified through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) tumor stains are more widely available, and accurately predicting HER2 status using H\&E could reduce costs and expedite treatment selection. Deep Learning algorithms for H&E have shown effectiveness in predicting various cancer features and clinical outcomes, including moderate success in HER2 status prediction. In this work, we employed a customized weak supervision classification technique combined with MoCo-v2 contrastive learning to predict HER2 status. We trained our pipeline on 182 publicly available H&E Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), for which annotations by the pathology team at Yale School of Medicine are publicly available. Our pipeline achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 across four different test folds. Additionally, we tested our model on 44 H&E slides from the TCGA-BRCA dataset, which had an HER2 score of 2+ and included corresponding HER2 status and FISH test results. These cases are considered equivocal for IHC, requiring an expensive FISH test on their IHC slides for disambiguation. Our pipeline demonstrated an AUC of 0.81 on these challenging H&E slides. Reducing the need for FISH test can have significant implications in cancer treatment equity for underserved populations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes FAST-LIVO2: a fast, direct LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry framework to achieve accurate and robust state estimation in SLAM tasks and provide great potential in real-time, onboard robotic applications. FAST-LIVO2 fuses the IMU, LiDAR and image measurements efficiently through an ESIKF. To address the dimension mismatch between the heterogeneous LiDAR and image measurements, we use a sequential update strategy in the Kalman filter. To enhance the efficiency, we use direct methods for both the visual and LiDAR fusion, where the LiDAR module registers raw points without extracting edge or plane features and the visual module minimizes direct photometric errors without extracting ORB or FAST corner features. The fusion of both visual and LiDAR measurements is based on a single unified voxel map where the LiDAR module constructs the geometric structure for registering new LiDAR scans and the visual module attaches image patches to the LiDAR points. To enhance the accuracy of image alignment, we use plane priors from the LiDAR points in the voxel map (and even refine the plane prior) and update the reference patch dynamically after new images are aligned. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of image alignment, FAST-LIVO2 employs an on-demanding raycast operation and estimates the image exposure time in real time. Lastly, we detail three applications of FAST-LIVO2: UAV onboard navigation demonstrating the system's computation efficiency for real-time onboard navigation, airborne mapping showcasing the system's mapping accuracy, and 3D model rendering (mesh-based and NeRF-based) underscoring the suitability of our reconstructed dense map for subsequent rendering tasks. We open source our code, dataset and application on GitHub to benefit the robotics community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), which ground various non-symbolic data (e.g., images and videos) into symbols, have attracted attention as resources enabling knowledge processing and machine learning across modalities. However, the construction of MMKGs for videos consisting of multiple events, such as daily activities, is still in the early stages. In this paper, we construct an MMKG based on synchronized multi-view simulated videos of daily activities. Besides representing the content of daily life videos as event-centric knowledge, our MMKG also includes frame-by-frame fine-grained changes, such as bounding boxes within video frames. In addition, we provide support tools for querying our MMKG. As an application example, we demonstrate that our MMKG facilitates benchmarking vision-language models by providing the necessary vision-language datasets for a tailored task.</p>
