<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Cobo, Roberto Valle, Jos\'e Miguel Buenaposada, Luis Baumela</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing deepfake detection to unseen manipulations remains a key challenge. A recent approach to tackle this issue is to train a network with pristine face images that have been manipulated with hand-crafted artifacts to extract more generalizable clues. While effective for static images, extending this to the video domain is an open issue. Existing methods model temporal artifacts as frame-to-frame instabilities, overlooking a key vulnerability: the violation of natural motion dependencies between different facial regions. In this paper, we propose a synthetic video generation method that creates training data with subtle kinematic inconsistencies. We train an autoencoder to decompose facial landmark configurations into motion bases. By manipulating these bases, we selectively break the natural correlations in facial movements and introduce these artifacts into pristine videos via face morphing. A network trained on our data learns to spot these sophisticated biomechanical flaws, achieving state-of-the-art generalization results on several popular benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The microscopic examination of surgical tissue remains a cornerstone of disease classification but relies on subjective interpretations and access to highly specialized experts, which can compromise accuracy and clinical care. While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishoy Galoaa, Xiangyu Bai, Shayda Moezzi, Utsav Nandi, Sai Siddhartha Vivek Dhir Rangoju, Somaieh Amraee, Sarah Ostadabbas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents LAPA (Look Around and Pay Attention), a novel end-to-end transformer-based architecture for multi-camera point tracking that integrates appearance-based matching with geometric constraints. Traditional pipelines decouple detection, association, and tracking, leading to error propagation and temporal inconsistency in challenging scenarios. LAPA addresses these limitations by leveraging attention mechanisms to jointly reason across views and time, establishing soft correspondences through a cross-view attention mechanism enhanced with geometric priors. Instead of relying on classical triangulation, we construct 3D point representations via attention-weighted aggregation, inherently accommodating uncertainty and partial observations. Temporal consistency is further maintained through a transformer decoder that models long-range dependencies, preserving identities through extended occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including our newly created multi-camera (MC) versions of TAPVid-3D panoptic and PointOdyssey, demonstrate that our unified approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 37.5% APD on TAPVid-3D-MC and 90.3% APD on PointOdyssey-MC, particularly excelling in scenarios with complex motions and occlusions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Chen, Joe Lin, Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur\\</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans naturally perceive continuous experience as a hierarchy of temporally nested events, fine-grained actions embedded within coarser routines. Replicating this structure in computer vision requires models that can segment video not just retrospectively, but predictively and hierarchically. We introduce PARSE, a unified framework that learns multiscale event structure directly from streaming video without supervision. PARSE organizes perception into a hierarchy of recurrent predictors, each operating at its own temporal granularity: lower layers model short-term dynamics while higher layers integrate longer-term context through attention-based feedback. Event boundaries emerge naturally as transient peaks in prediction error, yielding temporally coherent, nested partonomies that mirror the containment relations observed in human event perception. Evaluated across three benchmarks, Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and Assembly 101, PARSE achieves state-of-the-art performance among streaming methods and rivals offline baselines in both temporal alignment (H-GEBD) and structural consistency (TED, hF1). The results demonstrate that predictive learning under uncertainty provides a scalable path toward human-like temporal abstraction and compositional event understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Bai, He Liang, Bishoy Galoaa, Utsav Nandi, Shayda Moezzi, Yuhang He, Sarah Ostadabbas</p>
<p>Abstract: While text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in photorealism, generating intent-aligned videos that faithfully obey physics principles remains a core challenge. In this work, we systematically study Newtonian motion-controlled text-to-video generation and evaluation, emphasizing physical precision and motion coherence. We introduce MoReGen, a motion-aware, physics-grounded T2V framework that integrates multi-agent LLMs, physics simulators, and renderers to generate reproducible, physically accurate videos from text prompts in the code domain. To quantitatively assess physical validity, we propose object-trajectory correspondence as a direct evaluation metric and present MoReSet, a benchmark of 1,275 human-annotated videos spanning nine classes of Newtonian phenomena with scene descriptions, spatiotemporal relations, and ground-truth trajectories. Using MoReSet, we conduct experiments on existing T2V models, evaluating their physical validity through both our MoRe metrics and existing physics-based evaluators. Our results reveal that state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain physical validity, while MoReGen establishes a principled direction toward physically coherent video synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alara Dirik, Tuanfeng Wang, Duygu Ceylan, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Anna Fr\"uhst\"uck</p>
<p>Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims to separate images into physical components such as albedo, depth, normals, and illumination. While recent diffusion- and transformer-based models benefit from paired supervision from synthetic datasets, their generalization to diverse, real-world scenarios remains challenging. We propose ReasonX, a novel framework that leverages a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a perceptual judge providing relative intrinsic comparisons, and uses these comparisons as GRPO rewards for fine-tuning intrinsic decomposition models on unlabeled, in-the-wild images. Unlike RL methods for generative models, our framework aligns conditional intrinsic predictors by rewarding agreement between the judge's relational assessments and analytically derived relations from the model's outputs. ReasonX is model-agnostic and can be applied to different intrinsic predictors. Across multiple base architectures and modalities, ReasonX yields significant improvements, including 9-25% WHDR reduction on IIW albedo and up to 46% depth accuracy gains on ETH3D, highlighting the promise of MLLM-guided comparative supervision to bridge low- and high-level vision reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leon Mayer, Piotr Kalinowski, Caroline Ebersbach, Marcel Knopp, Tim R\"adsch, Evangelia Christodoulou, Annika Reinke, Fiona R. Kolbinger, Lena Maier-Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess performance on common anatomical presentations and fail to capture the challenges posed by rare variants. To address this gap, we introduce AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical regions. We call such variants that violate learned priors about "typical" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations. AdversarialAnatomyBench provides a foundation for systematically measuring and mitigating anatomical bias in multimodal medical AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoheng Fang, Chaohui Yu, Fan Wang, Qixing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MVRoom, a controllable novel view synthesis (NVS) pipeline for 3D indoor scenes that uses multi-view diffusion conditioned on a coarse 3D layout. MVRoom employs a two-stage design in which the 3D layout is used throughout to enforce multi-view consistency. The first stage employs novel representations to effectively bridge the 3D layout and consistent image-based condition signals for multi-view generation. The second stage performs image-conditioned multi-view generation, incorporating a layout-aware epipolar attention mechanism to enhance multi-view consistency during the diffusion process. Additionally, we introduce an iterative framework that generates 3D scenes with varying numbers of objects and scene complexities by recursively performing multi-view generation (MVRoom), supporting text-to-scene generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-fidelity and controllable 3D scene generation for NVS, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components within our generation pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitian Zhang, Iliyan Georgiev, Michael Fischer, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Lalonde, Valentin Deschaintre</p>
<p>Abstract: Lighting has a strong influence on visual appearance, yet understanding and representing lighting in images remains notoriously difficult. Various lighting representations exist, such as environment maps, irradiance, spherical harmonics, or text, but they are incompatible, which limits cross-modal transfer. We thus propose UniLight, a joint latent space as lighting representation, that unifies multiple modalities within a shared embedding. Modality-specific encoders for text, images, irradiance, and environment maps are trained contrastively to align their representations, with an auxiliary spherical-harmonics prediction task reinforcing directional understanding. Our multi-modal data pipeline enables large-scale training and evaluation across three tasks: lighting-based retrieval, environment-map generation, and lighting control in diffusion-based image synthesis. Experiments show that our representation captures consistent and transferable lighting features, enabling flexible manipulation across modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tasmiah Haque, Srinjoy Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Jia, Yuhao Huang, Shih-Hsin Wang, Cristina Garcia-Cardona, Andrea L. Bertozzi, Bao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching-based generative models have been integrated into the plug-and-play image restoration framework, and the resulting plug-and-play flow matching (PnP-Flow) model has achieved some remarkable empirical success for image restoration. However, the theoretical understanding of PnP-Flow lags its empirical success. In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Numerical results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline PnP-Flow and other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across evaluation metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly complex, with input data sizes scaling accordingly. Despite substantial advances in specialized deep learning hardware, data loading continues to be a major bottleneck that limits training and inference speed. To address this challenge, we propose training models directly on encoded JPEG features, reducing the computational overhead associated with full JPEG decoding and significantly improving data loading efficiency. While prior works have focused on recognition tasks, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for the restoration task of single-image super-resolution (SISR). We present a lightweight super-resolution pipeline that operates on JPEG discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in the frequency domain. Our pipeline achieves a 2.6x speedup in data loading and a 2.5x speedup in training, while preserving visual quality comparable to standard SISR approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gasser Elazab, Maximilian Jansen, Michael Unterreiner, Olaf Hellwich</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate perception of the vehicle's 3D surroundings, including fine-scale road geometry, such as bumps, slopes, and surface irregularities, is essential for safe and comfortable vehicle control. However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance. Our lightweight 8.88M-parameter model adapts robustly across diverse camera setups and, to our knowledge, is the first self-supervised monocular approach evaluated on RSRD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mainak Singha, Masih Aminbeidokhti, Paolo Casari, Elisa Ricci, Subhankar Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: While vision-language models like CLIP have been extensively studied, their calibration, crucial for reliable predictions, has received limited attention. Although a few prior works have examined CLIP calibration in offline settings, the impact of fine-tuning CLIP in a federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$ consistently produces well-calibrated models, reducing the need for explicit calibration procedures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Fonseca, Bruno Martins, Gil Rocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning has drawn considerable attention from the natural language processing and computer vision fields. Aiming to reduce the reliance on curated data, several studies have explored image captioning without any humanly-annotated image-text pairs for training, although existing methods are still outperformed by fully supervised approaches. This paper proposes TOMCap, i.e., an improved text-only training method that performs captioning without the need for aligned image-caption pairs. The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap. We specifically tested the combined use of retrieved examples of captions, and latent vector representations, to guide the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we show that TOMCap outperforms other training-free and text-only methods. We also analyze the impact of different choices regarding the configuration of the retrieval-augmentation and modality gap reduction components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Manuel Cantarero Angulo, Matthew Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources is driving increasing interest in edible insects, with Acheta domesticus (house cricket) identified as one of the most suitable species for industrial production. Current farming practices typically rear crickets in mixed-sex populations without automated sex sorting, despite potential benefits such as selective breeding, optimized reproduction ratios, and nutritional differentiation. This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm. The model reached a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.977 during testing, and real-world experiments with groups of crickets achieved an overall sorting accuracy of 86.8%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained devices for insect farming applications, offering a practical solution to improve efficiency and sustainability in cricket production.</p>

We present Mind-to-Face, the first framework that decodes non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signals directly into high-fidelity facial expressions. We build a dual-modality recording setup to obtain synchronized EEG and multi-view facial video during emotion-eliciting stimuli, enabling precise supervision for neural-to-visual learning. Our model uses a CNN-Transformer encoder to map EEG signals into dense 3D position maps, capable of sampling over 65k vertices, capturing fine-scale geometry and subtle emotional dynamics, and renders them through a modified 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline for photorealistic, view-consistent results. Through extensive evaluation, we show that EEG alone can reliably predict dynamic, subject-specific facial expressions, including subtle emotional responses, demonstrating that neural signals contain far richer affective and geometric information than previously assumed. Mind-to-Face establishes a new paradigm for neural-driven avatars, enabling personalized, emotion-aware telepresence and cognitive interaction in immersive environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashu Liao, Pietro Li\`o, Marc de Kamps, Duygu Sarikaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers face a fundamental limitation: standard self-attention jointly processes spatial and channel dimensions, leading to entangled representations that prevent independent modeling of structural and semantic dependencies. This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that DisentangleFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing models on Indian Pine, Pavia University, and Houston, the large-scale BigEarthNet remote sensing dataset, as well as an infrared pathology dataset. Moreover, it retains competitive accuracy on ImageNet while reducing computational cost by 17.8% in FLOPs. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghan Lee, Tsung-Wei Huang, Shiv Gehlot, Jaehoon Choi, Guan-Ming Su, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D scenes is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature, which requires aggregating information from multiple views to reconstruct time-evolving 3D geometry and motion. We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first general 4D Gaussian Splatting approach for unsynchronized video sets, without assuming the existence of predefined scene objects or prior models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Chen, Zhenhua Lei, Yahui Zhang, Tongzhi Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for generating high-quality Digital Image Correlation (DIC) dataset based on non-uniform B-spline surfaces. By randomly generating control point coordinates, we construct displacement fields that encompass a variety of realistic displacement scenarios, which are subsequently used to generate speckle pattern datasets. This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks. Through these innovations, this paper offers new perspectives and methods for dataset generation and algorithm performance enhancement in the field of DIC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waleed Khalid, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Reusing existing neural-network components is central to research efficiency, yet discovering, extracting, and validating such modules across thousands of open-source repositories remains difficult. We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code. Overall, NN-RAG transforms fragmented vision code into a reproducible, provenance-tracked substrate for algorithmic discovery, offering a first open-source solution that both quantifies and expands the diversity of executable neural architectures across repositories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyi Cai, Bryce Gernon, Wentao Bao, Yifan Li, Matthew Wright, Yu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of face forgeries has increasingly undermined confidence in the authenticity of online content. Given the rapid development of face forgery generation algorithms, new fake categories are likely to keep appearing, posing a major challenge to existing face forgery detection methods. Despite recent advances in face forgery detection, existing methods are typically limited to binary Real-vs-Fake classification or the identification of known fake categories, and are incapable of detecting the emergence of novel types of forgeries. In this work, we study the Open Set Face Forgery Detection (OSFFD) problem, which demands that the detection model recognize novel fake categories. We reformulate the OSFFD problem and address it through uncertainty estimation, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose the Dual-Level Evidential face forgery Detection (DLED) approach, which collects and fuses category-specific evidence on the spatial and frequency levels to estimate prediction uncertainty. Extensive evaluations conducted across diverse experimental settings demonstrate that the proposed DLED method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline models by an average of 20% in detecting forgeries from novel fake categories. Moreover, on the traditional Real-versus-Fake face forgery detection task, our DLED method concurrently exhibits competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-Po Chang, Wei-Yuan Cheng, Chi-Pin Huang, Fu-En Yang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancement in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate descriptive captions for input videos. However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Xu, Rujin Zhao, Xiong Xu, Boceng Huang, Yujia Jia, Hongfeng Long, Fuxuan Chen, Zilong Cao, Fangyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing stereo matching networks typically rely on either cost-volume construction based on 3D convolutions or deformation methods based on iterative optimization. The former incurs significant computational overhead during cost aggregation, whereas the latter often lacks the ability to model non-local contextual information. These methods exhibit poor compatibility on resource-constrained mobile devices, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. To address this, we propose a Multi-frequency Adaptive Fusion Network (MAFNet), which can produce high-quality disparity maps using only efficient 2D convolutions. Specifically, we design an adaptive frequency-domain filtering attention module that decomposes the full cost volume into high-frequency and low-frequency volumes, performing frequency-aware feature aggregation separately. Subsequently, we introduce a Linformer-based low-rank attention mechanism to adaptively fuse high- and low-frequency information, yielding more robust disparity estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAFNet significantly outperforms existing real-time methods on public datasets such as Scene Flow and KITTI 2015, showing a favorable balance between accuracy and real-time performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geunhyuk Youk, Jihyong Oh, Munchurl Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world video restoration is plagued by complex degradations from motion coupled with dynamically varying exposure - a key challenge largely overlooked by prior works and a common artifact of auto-exposure or low-light capture. We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hieu Dinh Trung Pham, Huy Minh Nhat Nguyen, Cuong Tuan Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods typically learn holistic representations where an image's domain-invariant structure is implicitly entangled with its domain-specific style. This presents an opportunity to further enhance generalization by disentangling these visual cues. In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation. Our design, which includes an asymmetric injection strategy, forces the model to learn a more robust vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04397">Performance Evaluation of Transfer Learning Based Medical Image Classification Techniques for Disease Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeeshan Ahmad, Shudi Bao, Meng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image classification plays an increasingly vital role in identifying various diseases by classifying medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, into different categories based on their features. In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyi Gao, Danpei Zhao, Bo Yuan, Wentao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective and hardware-friendly method, which plays a key role in lightweighting remote sensing object detection. However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhe Liu, Ehsan Javanmardi, Naren Bao, Alex Orsholits, Manabu Tsukada</p>
<p>Abstract: Ray tracing 3D Gaussian particles enables realistic effects such as depth of field, refractions, and flexible camera modeling for novel-view synthesis. However, existing methods trace Gaussians through proxy geometry, which requires constructing complex intermediate meshes and performing costly intersection tests. This limitation arises because Gaussian-based particles are not well suited as unified primitives for both ray tracing and rasterization. In this work, we propose a differentiable triangle-based ray tracing pipeline that directly treats triangles as rendering primitives without relying on any proxy geometry. Our results show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher rendering quality than existing ray tracing approaches while maintaining real-time rendering performance. Moreover, our pipeline can directly render triangles optimized by the rasterization-based method Triangle Splatting, thus unifying the primitives used in novel-view synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manar Alnaasan, Md Selim Sarowar, Sungho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and interpretable gait analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection of Parkinsons disease (PD),yet most existing approaches remain limited by single-modality inputs, low robustness, and a lack of clinical transparency. This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sidan Zhu, Hongteng Xu, Dixin Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: As a challenging video editing task, movie trailer generation involves selecting and reorganizing movie shots to create engaging trailers. Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a "selection-then-ranking" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods.

<p>Abstract: End-to-End autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a new paradigm, where trajectory planning plays a crucial role. Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Wang, Zhenkai Li, Tianwen Qian, Huanran Zheng, Zheng Wang, Yuqian Fu, Xiaoling Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As embodied intelligence advances toward real-world deployment, the ability to continuously perceive and reason over streaming visual inputs becomes essential. In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjin Kim, HyeokJun Lee, YoungJoon Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image denoising methods have leveraged generative modeling for real noise synthesis to address the costly acquisition of real-world noisy data. However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingzi Ma, Yulong Cao, Wenhao Ding, Shuibai Zhang, Yan Wang, Boris Ivanovic, Ming Jiang, Marco Pavone, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The autonomous driving community is increasingly focused on addressing the challenges posed by out-of-distribution (OOD) driving scenarios. A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios. These results suggest a controllable and reliable pathway for scalable end-to-end driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Zhang, Shunlin Liang, Wenyuan Li, Han Ma, Jianglei Xu, Yichuan Ma, Jiangwei Xie, Wei Li, Mengmeng Zhang, Ran Tao, Xiang-Gen Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the primary objectives of satellite remote sensing is to capture the complex dynamics of the Earth environment, which encompasses tasks such as reconstructing continuous cloud-free time series images, detecting land cover changes, and forecasting future surface evolution. However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks. It significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when facing challenges such as severe cloud contamination, modality absence, and forecasting phenological variations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengbo Guo, Junke Wang, Zhen Xing, Chengxu Liu, Daoguo Dong, Xueming Qian, Zuxuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents DeRA, a novel 1D video tokenizer that decouples the spatial-temporal representation learning in video tokenization to achieve better training efficiency and performance. Specifically, DeRA maintains a compact 1D latent space while factorizing video encoding into appearance and motion streams, which are aligned with pretrained vision foundation models to capture the spatial semantics and temporal dynamics in videos separately. To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD. Moreover, using DeRA for autoregressive video generation, we also achieve new state-of-the-art results on both UCF-101 class-conditional generation and K600 frame prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Sun, Oindrila Saha, Subhransu Maji</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the advent of controllable image generation, increasingly rich modes of control have enabled greater customization and accessibility for everyday users. Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds. We show that state-of-the-art baselines fail to maintain identity on this dataset, and we demonstrate that training on images grouped by species, age, and sex -- used as a proxy for identity -- substantially improves performance on both seen and unseen species.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunjong Lee, Eunhee Kim, Sanghoon Hong, Eunho Jung, Jihoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating stable and controllable character motion in real-time is a key challenge in computer animation. Existing methods often fail to provide fine-grained control or suffer from motion degradation over long sequences, limiting their use in interactive applications. We propose COMET, an autoregressive framework that runs in real time, enabling versatile character control and robust long-horizon synthesis. Our efficient Transformer-based conditional VAE allows for precise, interactive control over arbitrary user-specified joints for tasks like goal-reaching and in-betweening from a single model. To ensure long-term temporal stability, we introduce a novel reference-guided feedback mechanism that prevents error accumulation. This mechanism also serves as a plug-and-play stylization module, enabling real-time style transfer. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that COMET robustly generates high-quality motion at real-time speeds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in complex motion control tasks and confirming its readiness for demanding interactive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianci Huo, Lingfeng Qi, Yuhan Chen, Qihong Xue, Jinyuan Shao, Hai Yu, Jie Li, Zhanhua Zhang, Guofa Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Inevitable specular highlights in practical environments severely impair the visual performance, thus degrading the task effectiveness and efficiency. Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas. Specifically, we employ convolution operations to extract local details in the shallow layers of MM-SHR, and utilize the attention mechanism to capture global features in the deep layers, ensuring both operation efficiency and removal accuracy. To model long-range dependencies without compromising computational complexity, we utilize a coarse-to-fine manner and propose Omni-Directional Attention Integration Block(OAIBlock) and Adaptive Region-Aware Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Convolutional Network(HDDAConv) , which leverage omni-directiona pixel-shifting and window-dividing operations at the raw features to achieve specular highlight removal. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark tasks and six types of surface materials demonstrate that MM-SHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency for specular highlight removal. The implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Htcicv/MM-SHR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuduo Jin, Brandon Haworth</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a widely utilized and successful methodology in human motion synthesis. Task-oriented diffusion models have significantly advanced action-to-motion, text-to-motion, and audio-to-motion applications. In this paper, we investigate fundamental questions regarding motion representations and loss functions in a controlled study, and we enumerate the impacts of various decisions in the workflow of the generative motion diffusion model. To answer these questions, we conduct empirical studies based on a proxy motion diffusion model (MDM). We apply v loss as the prediction objective on MDM (vMDM), where v is the weighted sum of motion data and noise. We aim to enhance the understanding of latent data distributions and provide a foundation for improving the state of conditional motion diffusion models. First, we evaluate the six common motion representations in the literature and compare their performance in terms of quality and diversity metrics. Second, we compare the training time under various configurations to shed light on how to speed up the training process of motion diffusion models. Finally, we also conduct evaluation analysis on a large motion dataset. The results of our experiments indicate clear performance differences across motion representations in diverse datasets. Our results also demonstrate the impacts of distinct configurations on model training and suggest the importance and effectiveness of these decisions on the outcomes of motion diffusion models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04504">UltraImage: Rethinking Resolution Extrapolation in Image Diffusion Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Zhao, Bokai Yan, Xue Yang, Hongzhou Zhu, Jintao Zhang, Shilong Liu, Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image diffusion transformers achieve high-fidelity generation, but struggle to generate images beyond these scales, suffering from content repetition and quality degradation. In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghui Xing, Xiaoting Su, Shizhou Zhang, Donghao Chu, Di Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared imaging plays a critical role in low-light and adverse weather conditions. However, due to the distinct characteristics of infrared images, existing foundation models such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on visible data perform suboptimal in infrared image interpretation tasks. To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions. Pretrained on Inf-590K, DuGI-MAE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks, including infrared object detection, semantic segmentation, and small target detection. Experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over both supervised and self-supervised comparison methods. Our code is available in the supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liuzhou Zhang, Jiarui Ye, Yuanlei Wang, Ming Zhong, Mingju Cao, Wanke Xia, Bowen Zeng, Zeyu Zhang, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating long, coherent egocentric videos is difficult, as hand-object interactions and procedural tasks require reliable long-term memory. Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Yu, Xiaoshan Wu, Xinting Hu, Tao Hu, Yangtian Sun, Xiaoyang Lyu, Bo Wang, Lin Ma, Yuewen Ma, Zhongrui Wang, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) diffusion enables streaming, interactive long-video generation by producing frames causally, yet maintaining coherence over minute-scale horizons remains challenging due to accumulated errors, motion drift, and content repetition. We approach this problem from a memory perspective, treating video synthesis as a recurrent dynamical process that requires coordinated short- and long-term context. We propose VideoSSM, a Long Video Model that unifies AR diffusion with a hybrid state-space memory. The state-space model (SSM) serves as an evolving global memory of scene dynamics across the entire sequence, while a context window provides local memory for motion cues and fine details. This hybrid design preserves global consistency without frozen, repetitive patterns, supports prompt-adaptive interaction, and scales in linear time with sequence length. Experiments on short- and long-range benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art temporal consistency and motion stability among autoregressive video generator especially at minute-scale horizons, enabling content diversity and interactive prompt-based control, thereby establishing a scalable, memory-aware framework for long video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlin Xu, Lei Zhang, Lituan Wang, Xinyu Pu, Pengfei Ma, Guangwu Qian, Zizhou Wang, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the scarcity of annotated data and the substantial computational costs of model, conventional tuning methods in medical image segmentation face critical challenges. Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/Emilychenlin/BA-TTA-SAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruijing Liu, Cunhua Pan, Jiaming Zeng, Hong Ren, Kezhi Wang, Lei Kong, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While fulfilling communication tasks, wireless signals can also be used to sense the environment. Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modal matching task due to significant modality discrepancies. While current methods mainly focus on learning modality-invariant features through unified embedding spaces, they often focus solely on the common discriminative semantics across modalities while disregarding the critical role of modality-specific identity-aware knowledge in discriminative feature learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked. Then, we propose a Semantic Distillation Cascade Enhancement (SDCE) module, which distills identity-aware knowledge from the aggregated shallow features and guide the learning of modality-invariant features. Finally, an Identity Clues Guided (ICG) Loss is proposed to alleviate the modality discrepancies within the enhanced features and promote the learning of a diverse representation space. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets clearly show that our proposed ICRE outperforms existing SOTA methods.</p>

Specifically, in a process of iterative 3D reconstruction and scanning, Auto3R can make efficient and accurate prediction of uncertainty distribution over potential scanning viewpoints, without knowing the ground truth geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments, Auto3R achieves superior performance that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Wei Zhan, Xin Wang, Hong Chen, Tongtong Feng, Wei Feng, Ren Wang, Guangyao Li, Qing Li, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of video-language tasks. However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion. Experimental results demonstrate that PhyVLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs on both physical reasoning and general video understanding tasks, highlighting the advantages of incorporating explicit physical modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable progress in image and video editing, yet some tasks remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Object Retexture, which transfers local textures from a reference object to a target object in images or videos. To perform this task, a straightforward solution is to use ControlNet conditioned on the source structure and the reference texture. However, this approach suffers from limited controllability for two reasons: conditioning on the raw reference image introduces unwanted structural information, and it fails to disentangle the visual texture and structure information of the source. To address this problem, we propose Refa\c{c}ade, a method that consists of two key designs to achieve precise and controllable texture transfer in both images and videos. First, we employ a texture remover trained on paired textured/untextured 3D mesh renderings to remove appearance information while preserving the geometry and motion of source videos. Second, we disrupt the reference global layout using a jigsaw permutation, encouraging the model to focus on local texture statistics rather than the global layout of the object. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, precise editing, and controllability, outperforming strong baselines in both quantitative and human evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bita Baroutian, Atefe Aghaei, Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam</p>
<p>Abstract: Alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern and a major cause of accidents and fatalities worldwide. This study introduces a novel video-based facial sequence analysis approach dedicated to the detection of alcohol intoxication. The method integrates facial landmark analysis via a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with spatiotemporal visual features extracted using a 3D ResNet. These features are dynamically fused with adaptive prioritization to enhance classification performance. Additionally, we introduce a curated dataset comprising 3,542 video segments derived from 202 individuals to support training and evaluation. Our model is compared against two baselines: a custom 3D-CNN and a VGGFace+LSTM architecture. Experimental results show that our approach achieves 95.82% accuracy, 0.977 precision, and 0.97 recall, outperforming prior methods. The findings demonstrate the model's potential for practical deployment in public safety systems for non-invasive, reliable alcohol intoxication detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Yang, Hai Ci, Yiren Song, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of embodied AI has unlocked significant potential for intelligent humanoid robots. However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongbo Jin, Qingyuan Wang, Wenhao Zhang, Yang Liu, Sijie Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra long video understanding remains an open challenge, as existing vision language models (VLMs) falter on such content due to limited context length and inefficient long term memory retention. To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technique for novel view synthesis, demonstrating exceptional rendering efficiency. \replaced[]{Well-reconstructed surfaces can be characterized by low configurational entropy, where dominant primitives clearly define surface geometry while redundant components are suppressed.}{The key insight is that well-reconstructed surfaces naturally exhibit low configurational entropy, where dominant primitives clearly define surface geometry while suppressing redundant components.} Three complementary technical contributions are introduced: (1) entropy-driven surface modeling via entropy minimization for low configurational entropy in primitive distributions; (2) adaptive spatial regularization using the Surface Neighborhood Redundancy Index (SNRI) and image entropy-guided weighting; (3) multi-scale geometric preservation through competitive cross-scale entropy alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEF achieves competitive geometric precision on DTU and T\&T benchmarks, while delivering superior rendering quality compared to existing methods on Mip-NeRF 360. Notably, superior Chamfer Distance (0.64) on DTU and F1 score (0.44) on T\&T are obtained, alongside the best SSIM (0.855) and LPIPS (0.136) among baselines on Mip-NeRF 360, validating the framework's ability to enhance surface reconstruction accuracy without compromising photometric fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Pintore, Maura Pintor, Dimosthenis Karatzas, Battista Biggio</p>
<p>Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) enables end-to-end reasoning grounded on information present in a document input. While recent models have shown impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel attack scenario that aims to forge document content in a visually imperceptible yet semantically targeted manner, allowing an adversary to induce specific or generally incorrect answers from a DocVQA model. We develop specialized attack algorithms that can produce adversarially forged documents tailored to different attackers' goals, ranging from targeted misinformation to systematic model failure scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against two end-to-end state-of-the-art models: Pix2Struct, a vision-language transformer that jointly processes image and text through sequence-to-sequence modeling, and Donut, a transformer-based model that directly extracts text and answers questions from document images. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current DocVQA systems and call for the development of more robust defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zefeng Zhang, Xiangzhao Hao, Hengzhu Tang, Zhenyu Zhang, Jiawei Sheng, Xiaodong Li, Zhenyang Li, Li Gao, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Tingwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning is crucial for enabling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand object properties and spatial relationships, yet current models still struggle with 3D-aware reasoning. Existing approaches typically enhance either perception, by augmenting RGB inputs with auxiliary modalities such as depth and segmentation, or reasoning, by training on spatial VQA datasets and applying reinforcement learning, and thus treat these two aspects in isolation. In this work, we investigate whether a unified MLLM can develop an intrinsic ability to enhance spatial perception and, through adaptive interleaved reasoning, achieve stronger spatial intelligence. We propose \textbf{COOPER}, a unified MLLM that leverages depth and segmentation as auxiliary modalities and is trained in two stages to acquire auxiliary modality generation and adaptive, interleaved reasoning capabilities. COOPER achieves an average \textbf{6.91\%} improvement in spatial reasoning while maintaining general performance. Moreover, even a variant trained only for auxiliary modality generation attains a \textbf{7.92\%} gain on distance and size estimation, suggesting that learning to generate auxiliary modalities helps internalize spatial knowledge and strengthen spatial understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Supervised deep learning (DL) receives great interest for automated analysis of microscopic images with an increasing body of literature supporting its potential. The development and validation of those DL models relies heavily on the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets. However, creating such datasets is a complex and resource-intensive process, often hindered by challenges such as time constraints, domain variability, and risks of bias in image collection and label creation. This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three "C"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators. To support dataset creators, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided as supplemental material, outlining best practices for dataset development. Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of open datasets in driving innovation and enhancing reproducibility of DL research. By addressing the challenges and offering practical recommendations, this review aims to advance the creation of and availability to high-quality, large-scale datasets, ultimately contributing to the development of generalizable and robust DL models for pathology applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by traditional handmade crafts, where a person improvises assemblies based on the available objects, we formally introduce the Craft Assembly Task. It is a robotic assembly task that involves building an accurate representation of a given target object using the available objects, which do not directly correspond to its parts. In this work, we focus on selecting the subset of available objects for the final craft, when the given input is an RGB image of the target in the wild. We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishuo Wan, Qinqin Kang, Yi Huang, Yun Bian, Dawei Ding, Ke Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Tumor segmentation and diagnosis in contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) rely heavily on the physiological dynamics of contrast agents. However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the "missing modality" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04581">Infrared UAV Target Tracking with Dynamic Feature Refinement and Global Contextual Attention Knowledge Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Houzhang Fang, Chenxing Wu, Kun Bai, Tianqi Chen, Xiaolin Wang, Xiyang Liu, Yi Chang, Luxin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target tracking based on thermal infrared imaging has been one of the most important sensing technologies in anti-UAV applications. However, the infrared UAV targets often exhibit weak features and complex backgrounds, posing significant challenges to accurate tracking. To address these problems, we introduce SiamDFF, a novel dynamic feature fusion Siamese network that integrates feature enhancement and global contextual attention knowledge distillation for infrared UAV target (IRUT) tracking. The SiamDFF incorporates a selective target enhancement network (STEN), a dynamic spatial feature aggregation module (DSFAM), and a dynamic channel feature aggregation module (DCFAM). The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network. Extensive experiments on real infrared UAV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art target trackers under complex backgrounds while achieving a real-time tracking speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) has advanced open-vocabulary segmentation through promptable concept segmentation, allowing users to segment all instances corresponding to a given concept, typically specified with short noun-phrase (NP) prompts. While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications. The source code is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wu, Chuhao Zhou, Guangyu Zhao, Haozhi Cao, Yewen Pu, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires an agent to interpret language, perceive its environment, and navigate within 3D scenes to produce responses. Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Hang, Chaoxiang He, Hongsheng Hu, Hanqing Hu, Bin Benjamin Zhu, Shi-Feng Sun, Dawu Gu, Shuo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting illicit visual content demands more than image-level NSFW flags; moderators must also know what objects make an image illegal and where those objects occur. We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks. The full pipeline processes an image in seconds, plugs seamlessly into existing VLM workflows, and constitutes the first practical tool for fine-grained, explainable malicious-image moderation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yuan, Yuanbo Yang, Lin-Zhuo Chen, Yao Yao, Zhuzhong Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce HeFT (Head-Frequency Tracker), a zero-shot point tracking framework that leverages the visual priors of pretrained video diffusion models. To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang-Hsun Wu, Kai-Po Chang, Yu-Yang Sheng, Hung-Kai Chung, Kuei-Chun Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in video understanding. However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

Using I2I-Bench, we benchmark numerous mainstream image editing models, investigating the gaps and trade-offs between editing models across various dimensions. We will open-source all components of I2I-Bench to facilitate future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhong Lu, Yanhong Zeng, Haobo Li, Hao Ouyang, Qiuyu Wang, Ka Leong Cheng, Jiapeng Zhu, Hengyuan Cao, Zhipeng Zhang, Xing Zhu, Yujun Shen, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient streaming video generation is critical for simulating interactive and dynamic worlds. Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-view correspondence is a fundamental capability for spatial understanding and embodied AI. However, it is still far from being realized in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially in achieving precise point-level correspondence, which is crucial for precise affordance interaction. So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of "perceive", "reason", and "correspond". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction. To address this problem, we construct CrossPoint-378K, a dataset with 378K question-answering pairs across 900 scenes, focused on actionable affordance regions that better reflect real-world manipulation and interaction scenarios. Furthermore, we propose CroPond that trained on the CrossPoint-378K dataset. Our CroPond achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossPoint-Bench, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 39.7% accuracy, which offers a foundation for advancing future work on cross-view correspondence. The benchmark, dataset, and model are publicly available at https://github.com/WangYipu2002/CrossPoint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinning Chai, Zhengxue Cheng, Yuhong Zhang, Hengsheng Zhang, Yingsheng Qin, Yucai Yang, Rong Xie, Li Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) overcomes the limitation of traditional super-resolution (SR) methods that operate only at fixed scales (e.g., 4x), enabling a single model to handle arbitrary magnification. Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors. Code will be released at https://github.com/chaixinning/OmniScaleSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yigui Feng, Qinglin Wang, Haotian Mo, Yang Liu, Ke Liu, Gencheng Liu, Xinhai Chen, Siqi Shen, Songzhu Mei, Jie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative psychological analysis of in-the-wild conversations faces two fundamental challenges: (1) existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail to resolve Articulatory-Affective Ambiguity, where visual patterns of speech mimic emotional expressions; and (2) progress is stifled by a lack of verifiable evaluation metrics capable of assessing visual grounding and reasoning depth. We propose a complete ecosystem to address these twin challenges. First, we introduce Multilevel Insight Network for Disentanglement(MIND), a novel hierarchical visual encoder that introduces a Status Judgment module to algorithmically suppress ambiguous lip features based on their temporal feature variance, achieving explicit visual disentanglement. Second, we construct ConvoInsight-DB, a new large-scale dataset with expert annotations for micro-expressions and deep psychological inference. Third, Third, we designed the Mental Reasoning Insight Rating Metric (PRISM), an automated dimensional framework that uses expert-guided LLM to measure the multidimensional performance of large mental vision models. On our PRISM benchmark, MIND significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving a +86.95% gain in micro-expression detection over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our Status Judgment disentanglement module is the most critical component for this performance leap. Our code has been opened.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Tang, Haicheng Liao, Tong Nie, Junlin He, Ao Qu, Kehua Chen, Wei Ma, Zhenning Li, Lijun Sun, Chengzhong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems increasingly adopt vision-language-action (VLA) models, yet they typically ignore the passenger's emotional state, which is central to comfort and AD acceptance. We introduce Open-Domain End-to-End (OD-E2E) autonomous driving, where an autonomous vehicle (AV) must interpret free-form natural-language commands, infer the emotion, and plan a physically feasible trajectory. We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04734">MT-Depth: Multi-task Instance feature analysis for the Depth Completion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Haseeb Nizamani, Dandi Zhou, Xinhai Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth completion plays a vital role in 3D perception systems, especially in scenarios where sparse depth data must be densified for tasks such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively enhances depth accuracy near object boundaries, occlusions, and thin structures. Our findings suggest that incorporating instance-aware cues offers a promising direction for improving depth completion without relying on dense semantic labels.</p>

<p>Abstract: VR sketching lets users explore and iterate on ideas directly in 3D, offering a faster and more intuitive alternative to conventional CAD tools. However, existing sketch-to-shape models ignore the temporal ordering of strokes, discarding crucial cues about structure and design intent. We introduce VRSketch2Shape, the first framework and multi-category dataset for generating 3D shapes from sequential VR sketches. Our contributions are threefold: (i) an automated pipeline that generates sequential VR sketches from arbitrary shapes, (ii) a dataset of over 20k synthetic and 900 hand-drawn sketch-shape pairs across four categories, and (iii) an order-aware sketch encoder coupled with a diffusion-based 3D generator. Our approach yields higher geometric fidelity than prior work, generalizes effectively from synthetic to real sketches with minimal supervision, and performs well even on partial sketches.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04784">PaCo-RL: Advancing Reinforcement Learning for Consistent Image Generation with Pairwise Reward Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Ping, Chengyou Jia, Minnan Luo, Changliang Xia, Xin Shen, Zhuohang Dang, Hangwei Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistent image generation requires faithfully preserving identities, styles, and logical coherence across multiple images, which is essential for applications such as storytelling and character design. Supervised training approaches struggle with this task due to the lack of large-scale datasets capturing visual consistency and the complexity of modeling human perceptual preferences. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling models to learn complex and subjective visual criteria in a data-free manner. To achieve this, we introduce PaCo-RL, a comprehensive framework that combines a specialized consistency reward model with an efficient RL algorithm. The first component, PaCo-Reward, is a pairwise consistency evaluator trained on a large-scale dataset constructed via automated sub-figure pairing. It evaluates consistency through a generative, autoregressive scoring mechanism enhanced by task-aware instructions and CoT reasons. The second component, PaCo-GRPO, leverages a novel resolution-decoupled optimization strategy to substantially reduce RL cost, alongside a log-tamed multi-reward aggregation mechanism that ensures balanced and stable reward optimization. Extensive experiments across the two representative subtasks show that PaCo-Reward significantly improves alignment with human perceptions of visual consistency, and PaCo-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art consistency performance with improved training efficiency and stability. Together, these results highlight the promise of PaCo-RL as a practical and scalable solution for consistent image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Hao Chen, Zi-Xin Zou, Yan-Pei Cao, Ze Yuan, Guan Luo, Xiaojuan Qi, Ding Liang, Song-Hai Zhang, Yuan-Chen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, seamless textures directly on 3D surfaces, what we term 3D-native texturing, remains a fundamental open challenge, with the potential to overcome long-standing limitations of UV-based and multi-view projection methods. However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaFiTe not only sets a new benchmark for 3D-native texturing but also enables flexible downstream applications such as material synthesis and texture super-resolution, paving the way for the next generation of 3D content creation workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin He, Longhui Wei, Jianbo Ouyang, Lingxi Xie, Qi Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose EMMA, an efficient and unified architecture for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Specifically, EMMA primarily consists of 1) An efficient autoencoder with a 32x compression ratio, which significantly reduces the number of tokens required for generation. This also ensures the training balance between understanding and generation tasks by applying the same compression ratio to images. 2) Channel-wise concatenation instead of token-wise concatenation among visual understanding and generation tokens, which further reduces the visual tokens in unified architectures. 3) A shared-and-decoupled network that enables mutual improvements across tasks while meeting the task-specific modeling requirements. 4) A mixture-of-experts mechanism adopted for visual understanding encoder, which substantially improves perceptual capabilities with a few parameters increase. Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image). We believe that EMMA lays a solid foundation for the future development of unified multimodal architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanyu Fu, Guanying Chen, Yuqi Zhang, Kunbin Yao, Yuan Xiong, Chuan Huang, Shuguang Cui, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling in-the-wild scenes affected by transient objects and illuminations, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Third, we incorporate the delayed Gaussian growth strategy and mask bootstrapping with appearance modeling to handling in-the-wild scenes including transients and illuminations. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huynh Trinh Ngoc, Hoang Anh Nguyen Kim, Toan Nguyen Hai, Long Tran Quoc</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable progress with the emergence of flow matching (FM). It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models. Through comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy while remaining highly efficient in the latent space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Closed-loop simulation and scalable pre-training for autonomous driving require synthesizing free-viewpoint driving scenes. However, existing datasets and generative pipelines rarely provide consistent off-trajectory observations, limiting large-scale evaluation and training. While recent generative models demonstrate strong visual realism, they struggle to jointly achieve interpolation consistency and extrapolation realism without per-scene optimization. To address this, we propose FreeGen, a feed-forward reconstruction-generation co-training framework for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis. The reconstruction model provides stable geometric representations to ensure interpolation consistency, while the generation model performs geometry-aware enhancement to improve realism at unseen viewpoints. Through co-training, generative priors are distilled into the reconstruction model to improve off-trajectory rendering, and the refined geometry in turn offers stronger structural guidance for generation. Experiments demonstrate that FreeGen achieves state-of-the-art performance for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Small Building Model (SBM), a Transformer-based architecture for layout synthesis in Building Information Modeling (BIM) scenes. We address the question of how to tokenize buildings by unifying heterogeneous feature sets of architectural elements into sequences while preserving compositional structure. Such feature sets are represented as a sparse attribute-feature matrix that captures room properties. We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikang Cheng, Renye Yan, Zhiyuan Yan, Yaozhong Gan, Xueyi Zhang, Zhongyuan Wang, Wei Peng, Ling Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for deepfake detection aim to develop generalizable detectors. Although "generalizable" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT). Experiments demonstrate our superiority in predicting real-fake under the MID-FFD scenario while maintaining original generalization ability to unseen data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Zeren Zhang, Chanfan Gan, Tieyuan Chen, Weiyao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and multimodal synthesis, owing to its scalability and generality. However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B.</p>

<p>Abstract: Capturing accurate 3D human pose in the wild would provide valuable data for training pose estimation and motion generation methods. While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

<p>Abstract: Automated lesion detection in chest X-rays has demonstrated significant potential for improving clinical diagnosis by precisely localizing pathological abnormalities. While recent promptable detection frameworks have achieved remarkable accuracy in target localization, existing methods typically rely on manual annotations as prompts, which are labor-intensive and impractical for clinical applications. To address this limitation, we propose SP-Det, a novel self-prompted detection framework that automatically generates rich textual context to guide multi-label lesion detection without requiring expert annotations. Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations. Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories demonstrate that our SP-Det framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while completely eliminating the dependency on expert-annotated prompts compared to existing promptable architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Wen, Yu Hu, Suixuan Qiu, Jinshan Huang, Xiaowen Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time tracking of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on edge devices faces a fundamental resolution-speed conflict. Downsampling high-resolution imagery to standard detector input sizes causes small target features to collapse below detectable thresholds. Yet processing native 1080p frames on resource-constrained platforms yields insufficient throughput for smooth gimbal control. We propose SDG-Track, a Sparse Detection-Guided Tracker that adopts an Observer-Follower architecture to reconcile this conflict. The Observer stream runs a high-capacity detector at low frequency on the GPU to provide accurate position anchors from 1920x1080 frames. The Follower stream performs high-frequency trajectory interpolation via ROI-constrained sparse optical flow on the CPU. To handle tracking failures from occlusion or model drift caused by spectrally similar distractors, we introduce Dual-Space Recovery, a training-free re-acquisition mechanism combining color histogram matching with geometric consistency constraints. Experiments on a ground-to-air tracking station demonstrate that SDG-Track achieves 35.1 FPS system throughput while retaining 97.2\% of the frame-by-frame detection precision. The system successfully tracks agile FPV drones under real-world operational conditions on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanto Hidayatullah, Nurjannah Syakrani, Yudi Widhiyasana, Muhammad Rizqi Sholahuddin, Refdinal Tubagus, Zahri Al Adzani Hidayat, Hanri Fajar Ramadhan, Dafa Alfarizki Pratama, Farhan Muhammad Yasin</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection constitutes the primary task within the domain of computer vision. It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramya Muthukrishnan, Borjan Gagoski, Aryn Lee, P. Ellen Grant, Elfar Adalsteinsson, Polina Golland, Benjamin Billot</p>
<p>Abstract: We present E(3)-Pose, a novel fast pose estimation method that jointly and explicitly models rotation equivariance and object symmetry. Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains. Crucially, E(3)-Pose achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on clinical MRI volumes, paving the way for clinical translation. Our implementation is available at github.com/ramyamut/E3-Pose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanbo Huang, Jingjia Mao, Fanding Huang, Fengkai Liu, Xiangyang Luo, Yaoyuan Liang, Jiasheng Lu, Xiaoe Wang, Pei Liu, Ruiliu Fu, Shao-Lun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite tremendous recent progress, Flow Matching methods still suffer from exposure bias due to discrepancies in training and inference. This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04926">Semantics Lead the Way: Harmonizing Semantic and Texture Modeling with Asynchronous Latent Diffusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueming Pan, Ruoyu Feng, Qi Dai, Yuqi Wang, Wenfeng Lin, Mingyu Guo, Chong Luo, Nanning Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) inherently follow a coarse-to-fine generation process, where high-level semantic structure is generated slightly earlier than fine-grained texture. This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: The Herculaneum Papyri are a collection of rolled papyrus documents that were charred and buried by the famous eruption of Mount Vesuvius. They promise to contain a wealth of previously unseen Greek and Latin texts, but are extremely fragile and thus most cannot be unrolled physically. A solution to access these texts is virtual unrolling, where the papyrus surface is digitally traced out in a CT scan of the scroll, to create a flattened representation. This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan. We conduct comprehensive experiments on high-resolution CT scans of two scrolls, showing that our approach successfully unrolls large regions, and exceeds the performance of the only existing automated unrolling method suitable for this data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Shu, Cheng Lin, Tao Xie, Wei Yin, Ben Li, Zhiyuan Pu, Weize Li, Yao Yao, Xun Cao, Xiaoyang Guo, Xiao-Xiao Long</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D vision foundation models like Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) have advanced greatly in geometric perception. However, it is time-consuming and memory-intensive for long sequences, limiting application to large-scale scenes beyond hundreds of images. To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains. Extensive experiments validate LiteVGGT's effectiveness, scalability, and robustness. Project page: https://garlicba.github.io/LiteVGGT/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Novanto Yudistira</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a pioneering methodology for human action recognition by harnessing deep neural network techniques and adaptive fusion strategies across multiple modalities, including RGB, optical flows, audio, and depth information. Employing gating mechanisms for multimodal fusion, we aim to surpass limitations inherent in traditional unimodal recognition methods while exploring novel possibilities for diverse applications. Through an exhaustive investigation of gating mechanisms and adaptive weighting-based fusion architectures, our methodology enables the selective integration of relevant information from various modalities, thereby bolstering both accuracy and robustness in action recognition tasks. We meticulously examine various gated fusion strategies to pinpoint the most effective approach for multimodal action recognition, showcasing its superiority over conventional unimodal methods. Gating mechanisms facilitate the extraction of pivotal features, resulting in a more holistic representation of actions and substantial enhancements in recognition performance. Our evaluations across human action recognition, violence action detection, and multiple self-supervised learning tasks on benchmark datasets demonstrate promising advancements in accuracy. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize action recognition systems across diverse fields. The fusion of multimodal information promises sophisticated applications in surveillance and human-computer interaction, especially in contexts related to active assisted living.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation. However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupu Yao, Bowen Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard Vision Transformers flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, disrupting the natural spatial topology. While Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D, it inherits this limitation, often treating spatially distant patches (e.g., at row edges) as sequence neighbors. Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04967">Balanced Few-Shot Episodic Learning for Accurate Retinal Disease Diagnosis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasmaine Khale, Ravi Prakash Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> NaHyeon Park, Kunhee Kim, Junsuk Choe, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Rich feature representations derived from CLIP-ViT have been widely utilized in AI-generated image detection. While most existing methods primarily leverage features from the final layer, we systematically analyze the contributions of layer-wise features to this task. Our study reveals that earlier layers provide more localized and generalizable features, often surpassing the performance of final-layer features in detection tasks. Moreover, we find that different layers capture distinct aspects of the data, each contributing uniquely to AI-generated image detection. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel adaptive method, termed MoLD, which dynamically integrates features from multiple ViT layers using a gating-based mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GAN- and diffusion-generated images demonstrate that MoLD significantly improves detection performance, enhances generalization across diverse generative models, and exhibits robustness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we illustrate the scalability and versatility of our approach by successfully applying it to other pre-trained ViTs, such as DINOv2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> NaHyeon Park, Namin An, Kunhee Kim, Soyeon Yoon, Jiahao Huo, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM) based text-to-image (T2I) systems have become the dominant paradigm in image generation, yet whether they amplify social biases remains insufficiently understood. In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment. We believe our findings provide deeper insight into the central role of system prompts in bias propagation and offer a practical, deployable approach for building more socially responsible T2I systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a memory-efficient optimization strategy for the high-performance point cloud registration algorithm VANICP, enabling lightweight execution on embedded GPUs with constrained hardware resources. VANICP is a recently published acceleration framework that significantly improves the computational efficiency of point-cloud-based applications. By transforming the global nearest neighbor search into a localized process through a dilation-based information propagation mechanism, VANICP greatly reduces the computational complexity of the NNS. However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation. Furthermore, based on this strategy, we construct an enhanced version of the VANICP framework that achieves over 97% reduction in memory consumption while preserving the original performance.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-transformer (DiT) framework for single-image reflection removal that leverages the generalization strengths of foundation diffusion models in the restoration setting. Rather than relying on task-specific architectures, we repurpose a pre-trained DiT-based foundation model by conditioning it on reflection-contaminated inputs and guiding it toward clean transmission layers. We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks. These results demonstrate that pretrained diffusion transformers, when paired with physically grounded data synthesis and efficient adaptation, offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for reflection removal.

<p>Abstract: The perception of transparent objects is one of the well-known challenges in computer vision. Conventional depth sensors have difficulty in sensing the depth of transparent objects due to refraction and reflection of light. Previous research has typically train a neural network to complete the depth acquired by the sensor, and this method can quickly and accurately acquire accurate depth maps of transparent objects. However, previous training relies on a large amount of annotation data for supervision, and the labeling of depth maps is costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new self-supervised method for training depth completion networks. Our method simulates the depth deficits of transparent objects within non-transparent regions and utilizes the original depth map as ground truth for supervision. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to supervised approach, and pre-training with our method can improve the model performance when the training samples are small.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Mao, Hao Cheng, Tinghan Yang, Libiao Jin, Siwei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition remains challenging due to the limited data, high writing style variance, and scripts with complex diacritics. Existing approaches, though partially address these issues, often struggle to generalize without massive synthetic data. To address these challenges, we propose HTR-ConvText, a model designed to capture fine-grained, stroke-level local features while preserving global contextual dependencies. In the feature extraction stage, we integrate a residual Convolutional Neural Network backbone with a MobileViT with Positional Encoding block. This enables the model to both capture structural patterns and learn subtle writing details. We then introduce the ConvText encoder, a hybrid architecture combining global context and local features within a hierarchical structure that reduces sequence length for improved efficiency. Additionally, an auxiliary module injects textual context to mitigate the weakness of Connectionist Temporal Classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Houdr\'e, Diego Marcos, Hugo Riffaud de Turckheim, Dino Ienco, Laurent Wendling, Camille Kurtz, Sylvain Lobry</p>
<p>Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data spans a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, from high-resolution optical imagery to low resolution multispectral products or radar time series. While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhigyan Bhattacharya, Hiranmoy Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Image inpainting aim is to restore the missing or corrupted regions in face images while preserving identity, structural consistency and photorealistic image quality, a task specifically created for photo restoration. Though there are recent lot of advances in deep generative models, existing methods face problems with large irregular masks, often producing blurry textures on the edges of the masked region, semantic inconsistencies, or unconvincing facial structures due to direct pixel level synthesis approach and limited exploitation of facial priors. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent. The architecture naturally handles arbitrary mask configurations through dynamic attention without maskspecific training. Experiment on two datasets CelebA-HQ and FFHQ shows that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in metrics like LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM. It produces visually striking results with better semantic preservation, in challenging large-area inpainting situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanran Zhang, Ziyi Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Zheng Zhu, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating interactive and dynamic 4D scenes from a single static image remains a core challenge. Most existing generate-then-reconstruct and reconstruct-then-generate methods decouple geometry from motion, causing spatiotemporal inconsistencies and poor generalization. To address these, we extend the reconstruct-then-generate framework to jointly perform Motion generation and geometric Reconstruction for 4D Synthesis (MoRe4D). We first introduce TrajScene-60K, a large-scale dataset of 60,000 video samples with dense point trajectories, addressing the scarcity of high-quality 4D scene data. Based on this, we propose a diffusion-based 4D Scene Trajectory Generator (4D-STraG) to jointly generate geometrically consistent and motion-plausible 4D point trajectories. To leverage single-view priors, we design a depth-guided motion normalization strategy and a motion-aware module for effective geometry and dynamics integration. We then propose a 4D View Synthesis Module (4D-ViSM) to render videos with arbitrary camera trajectories from 4D point track representations. Experiments show that MoRe4D generates high-quality 4D scenes with multi-view consistency and rich dynamic details from a single image. Code: https://github.com/Zhangyr2022/MoRe4D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianfeng Wu, Yajing Bai, Minghan Li, Xianzu Wu, Xueqi Zhao, Zhongyuan Lai, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing 4D language fields is crucial for embodied AI, augmented/virtual reality, and 4D scene understanding, as they provide enriched semantic representations of dynamic environments and enable open-vocabulary querying in complex scenarios. However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

<p>Abstract: Emerging video diffusion models achieve high visual fidelity but fundamentally couple scene dynamics with camera motion, limiting their ability to provide precise spatial and temporal control. We introduce a 4D-controllable video diffusion framework that explicitly decouples scene dynamics from camera pose, enabling fine-grained manipulation of both scene dynamics and camera viewpoint. Our framework takes continuous world-time sequences and camera trajectories as conditioning inputs, injecting them into the video diffusion model through a 4D positional encoding in the attention layer and adaptive normalizations for feature modulation. To train this model, we curate a unique dataset in which temporal and camera variations are independently parameterized; this dataset will be made public. Experiments show that our model achieves robust real-world 4D control across diverse timing patterns and camera trajectories, while preserving high generation quality and outperforming prior work in controllability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghan Zhu, Zhiyi Wang, Qihang Sun, Maani Ghaffari, Michael Posa</p>
<p>Abstract: Object geometry is key information for robot manipulation. Yet, object reconstruction is a challenging task because cameras only capture partial observations of objects, especially when occlusion occurs. In this paper, we leverage two extra sources of information to reduce the ambiguity of vision signals. First, generative models learn priors of the shapes of commonly seen objects, allowing us to make reasonable guesses of the unseen part of geometry. Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry. We combine the two sources of information through contact-guided 3D generation. The guidance formulation is inspired by drag-based editing in generative models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach improves the reconstruction compared to pure 3D generation and contact-based optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jung Yi, Wooseok Jang, Paul Hyunbin Cho, Jisu Nam, Heeji Yoon, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive video diffusion have enabled real-time frame streaming, yet existing solutions still suffer from temporal repetition, drift, and motion deceleration. We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobo Yuan, Yueyi Sun, Yanwei Li, Tao Zhang, Xueqing Deng, Henghui Ding, Lu Qi, Anran Wang, Xiangtai Li, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance on tasks such as visual grounding and visual question answering. However, the reasoning processes of these models remain largely opaque; they typically output only final predictions without revealing the intermediate steps or fine-grained evidence (e.g., pixels, locations) that lead to the result. This contrasts with human intelligence, which naturally operates through a chain of visual reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) task, which requires models to not only localize the target object but also explicitly predict the intermediate objects that form the reasoning path. To advance research in this area, we contribute: (1) VRT-Bench, a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning; (2) a new metric for assessing the quality of reasoning traces; and (3) VRT-80k, a large-scale dataset for reasoning model training. Our experiments reveal that while existing models often produce the correct final output, they struggle to ground their intermediate reasoning. In contrast, models trained on VRT-80k achieve substantial improvements in tracing the reasoning path.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Gao, Jin Song</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) for AI-generated images (AIGI) has advanced rapidly; however, existing methods primarily target portraits and artistic images, lacking a systematic evaluation of interior scenes. We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality. Experiments indicate that SA-IQA significantly outperforms existing methods on SA-BENCH, setting a new standard for spatial aesthetics evaluation. Code and dataset will be open-sourced to advance research and applications in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Ma, Shengkai Hu, Jun Wan, Jiaxing Huang, Lefei Zhang, Salman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) tasks often involve diverse degradation that require robust and versatile strategies. However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EvoIR outperforms state-of-the-art AiOIR methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zeng, Charles Ochoa, Mingyuan Zhou, Vishal M. Patel, Vitor Guizilini, Rowan McAllister</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion {\phi}-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. {\phi}-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, {\phi}-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, {\phi}-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

<p>Abstract: We introduce ShadowDraw, a framework that transforms ordinary 3D objects into shadow-drawing compositional art. Given a 3D object, our system predicts scene parameters, including object pose and lighting, together with a partial line drawing, such that the cast shadow completes the drawing into a recognizable image. To this end, we optimize scene configurations to reveal meaningful shadows, employ shadow strokes to guide line drawing generation, and adopt automatic evaluation to enforce shadow-drawing coherence and visual quality. Experiments show that ShadowDraw produces compelling results across diverse inputs, from real-world scans and curated datasets to generative assets, and naturally extends to multi-object scenes, animations, and physical deployments. Our work provides a practical pipeline for creating shadow-drawing art and broadens the design space of computational visual art, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and artistic storytelling.

<p>Abstract: Reward models are critical for aligning vision-language systems with human preferences, yet current approaches suffer from hallucination, weak visual grounding, and an inability to use tools for verification, limiting their reliability on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced text-to-image generation. However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Jen Chien, Yi-Chuan Huang, Chung-Ho Wu, Wei-Lun Chao, Yu-Lun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in illumination control extend image-based methods to video, yet still facing a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency. Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective communication is central to achieving positive healthcare outcomes in mental health contexts, yet international students often face linguistic and cultural barriers that hinder their communication of mental distress. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication.</p>

Here, we overcome this gap by applying a deep learning framework to a global mosaic of Planetscope satellite imagery from 2020 and 2024. The result is the first global multi-temporal dataset of road pavedness and width for 9.2 million km of critical arterial roads, achieving 95.5% coverage where nearly half the network was previously unclassified. This dataset reveals a powerful multi-scale geography of human development. At the planetary scale, we show that the rate of change in pavedness is a robust proxy for a country's development trajectory (correlation with HDI = 0.65). At the national scale, we quantify how unpaved roads constitute a fragile backbone for economic connectivity. We further synthesize our data into a global Humanitarian Passability Matrix with direct implications for humanitarian logistics. At the local scale, case studies demonstrate the framework's versatility: in Ghana, road quality disparities expose the spatial outcomes of governance; in Pakistan, the data identifies infrastructure vulnerabilities to inform climate resilience planning. Together, this work delivers both a foundational dataset and a multi-scale analytical framework for monitoring global infrastructure, from the dynamics of national development to the realities of local governance, climate adaptation, and equity. Unlike traditional proxies such as nighttime lights, which reflect economic activity, road surface data directly measures the physical infrastructure that underpins prosperity and resilience - at higher spatial resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Dang, Thushari Hapuarachchi, Kaiqi Xiong, Jing Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training is an effective method to improve the machine learning (ML) model robustness. Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used. That is, a proper percentage of data sharing can significantly improve the ML model robustness, which is useful to some real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Zhou, Weijie Hong, Huandong Wang, Jianfeng Zheng, Qiuhua Wang, Yali Song, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Yong Li, Xinlei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained air pollution forecasting is crucial for urban management and the development of healthy buildings. Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Dogra, Eric Ngo, Mohammad Alam, Jean-Paul Talavera, Asim Dahal</p>
<p>Abstract: We challenge the common belief that deep learning always trumps older techniques, using the example of grading Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle gold coins automatically. In our work, we put a feature-based Artificial Neural Network built around 192 custom features pulled from Sobel edge detection and HSV color analysis up against a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network that blends in EfficientNetV2, plus a straightforward Support Vector Machine as the control. Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups. This rings true for other niche quality checks where data's thin and know-how matters more than raw compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhen Wu, Zhe Cao, Yuchi Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Image convolution with complex kernels is a fundamental operation in photography, scientific imaging, and animation effects, yet direct dense convolution is computationally prohibitive on resource-limited devices. Existing approximations, such as simulated annealing or low-rank decompositions, either lack efficiency or fail to capture non-convex kernels. We introduce a differentiable kernel decomposition framework that represents a target spatially-variant, dense, complex kernel using a set of sparse kernel samples. Our approach features (i) a decomposition that enables differentiable optimization of sparse kernels, (ii) a dedicated initialization strategy for non-convex shapes to avoid poor local minima, and (iii) a kernel-space interpolation scheme that extends single-kernel filtering to spatially varying filtering without retraining and additional runtime overhead. Experiments on Gaussian and non-convex kernels show that our method achieves higher fidelity than simulated annealing and significantly lower cost than low-rank decompositions. Our approach provides a practical solution for mobile imaging and real-time rendering, while remaining fully differentiable for integration into broader learning pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zheng, Ran Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In the history of knowledge distillation, the focus has once shifted over time from logit-based to feature-based approaches. However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alaa Zniber, Arne Symons, Ouassim Karrakchou, Marian Verhelst, Mounir Ghogho</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in high-performance computing and cloud technologies have enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated Deep Learning (DL) models. However, the growing demand for embedded intelligence at the edge imposes stringent computational and energy constraints, challenging the deployment of these large-scale models. Early Exiting Neural Networks (EENN) have emerged as a promising solution, allowing dynamic termination of inference based on input complexity to enhance efficiency. Despite their potential, EENN performance is highly influenced by the heterogeneity of edge accelerators and the constraints imposed by quantization, affecting accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency. Yet, research on the automatic optimization of EENN design for edge hardware remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that systematically integrates the effects of quantization and hardware resource allocation to optimize the placement of early exit points within a network backbone. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our NAS framework can discover architectures that achieve over a 50\% reduction in computational costs compared to conventional static networks, making them more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimo Bini, Ondrej Bohdal, Umberto Michieli, Zeynep Akata, Mete Ozay, Taha Ceritli</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable consistency during prolonged dialogues by storing relevant memories and incorporating them as context. Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Ni, Zekai Wang, Wei Lin, Amir Bar, Yann LeCun, Trevor Darrell, Jitendra Malik, Roei Herzig</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly improving in their ability to synthesize human actions in novel contexts, holding the potential to serve as high-level planners for contextual robot control. To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Hoffmann, Lilla Z\"ollei, Adrian V. Dalca</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: While methods exist for aligning flow matching models--a popular and effective class of generative models--with human preferences, existing approaches fail to achieve both adaptation efficiency and probabilistically sound prior preservation. In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Chang, Aolong Zha, Weimin Wang, Xin Liu, Masaki Onishi, Lei Lei, Meng Joo Er, Tsutomu Maruyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile stereo-matching systems have become an important part of many applications, such as automated-driving vehicles and autonomous robots. Accurate stereo-matching methods usually lead to high computational complexity; however, mobile platforms have only limited hardware resources to keep their power consumption low; this makes it difficult to maintain both an acceptable processing speed and accuracy on mobile platforms. To resolve this trade-off, we herein propose a novel acceleration approach for the well-known zero-means normalized cross correlation (ZNCC) matching cost calculation algorithm on a Jetson Tx2 embedded GPU. In our method for accelerating ZNCC, target images are scanned in a zigzag fashion to efficiently reuse one pixel's computation for its neighboring pixels; this reduces the amount of data transmission and increases the utilization of on-chip registers, thus increasing the processing speed. As a result, our method is 2X faster than the traditional image scanning method, and 26% faster than the latest NCC method. By combining this technique with the domain transformation (DT) algorithm, our system show real-time processing speed of 32 fps, on a Jetson Tx2 GPU for 1,280x384 pixel images with a maximum disparity of 128. Additionally, the evaluation results on the KITTI 2015 benchmark show that our combined system is more accurate than the same algorithm combined with census by 7.26%, while maintaining almost the same processing speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxuan Lu, Derek Gloudemans, Shepard Xia, Daniel B. Work</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a challenging task because depth information is difficult to obtain from 2D images. A subset of viewpoint-agnostic monocular 3D detection methods also do not explicitly leverage scene homography or geometry during training, meaning that a model trained thusly can detect objects in images from arbitrary viewpoints. Such works predict the projections of the 3D bounding boxes on the image plane to estimate the location of the 3D boxes, but these projections are not rectangular so the calculation of IoU between these projected polygons is not straightforward. This work proposes an efficient, fully differentiable algorithm for the calculation of IoU between two convex polygons, which can be utilized to compute the IoU between two 3D bounding box footprints viewed from an arbitrary angle. We test the performance of the proposed polygon IoU loss (PIoU loss) on three state-of-the-art viewpoint-agnostic 3D detection models. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed PIoU loss converges faster than L1 loss and that in 3D detection models, a combination of PIoU loss and L1 loss gives better results than L1 loss alone (+1.64% AP70 for MonoCon on cars, +0.18% AP70 for RTM3D on cars, and +0.83%/+2.46% AP50/AP25 for MonoRCNN on cyclists).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseo Kim, Hyeonseo Yang, Taekyung Kim, YoonSung Kim, Minsu Lee, Jin-Hwa Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: View selection is critical in active 3D neural reconstruction as it impacts the contents of training set and resulting final output quality. Recent view selection strategies emphasize the visibility when evaluating model uncertainty in active 3D reconstruction. However, existing approaches estimate visibility only after the model fully converges, which has confined their application primarily to non-continuous active learning settings. This paper proposes Surface-Based Visibility field (SBV) that successfully estimates the visibility-guided uncertainty in continuous active 3D neural reconstruction. During learning neural implicit surfaces, our model learns rendering uncertainties and infers surface confidence values derived from signed distance functions. It then updates surface confidences using a voxel grid, robustly deducing the surface-based visibility for uncertainties. This approach captures uncertainties across all regions, whether well-defined surfaces or ambiguous areas, ensuring accurate visibility measurement in continuous active learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets-Tanks and Temples, BlendedMVS, Blender, DTU-and the newly proposed imbalanced viewpoint dataset (ImBView) show that view selection based on SBV-guided uncertainty improves performance by up to 11.6% over existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging reconstruction scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Futa Waseda, Antonio Tejero-de-Pablos, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Che, Ryo Furukawa, Asako Kanezaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Category-level articulated object pose estimation focuses on the pose estimation of unknown articulated objects within known categories. Despite its significance, this task remains challenging due to the varying shapes and poses of objects, expensive dataset annotation costs, and complex real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised approach that leverages a single-frame point cloud to solve this task. Our model consistently generates reconstruction with a canonical pose and joint state for the entire input object, and it estimates object-level poses that reduce overall pose variance and part-level poses that align each part of the input with its corresponding part of the reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous self-supervised methods and is comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised methods. To assess the performance of our model in real-world scenarios, we also introduce a new real-world articulated object benchmark dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kotaro Kikuchi, Ukyo Honda, Naoto Inoue, Mayu Otani, Edgar Simo-Serra, Kota Yamaguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MarkupDM, a multimodal markup document model that represents graphic design as an interleaved multimodal document consisting of both markup language and images. Unlike existing holistic approaches that rely on an element-by-attribute grid representation, our representation accommodates variable-length elements, type-dependent attributes, and text content. Inspired by fill-in-the-middle training in code generation, we train the model to complete the missing part of a design document from its surrounding context, allowing it to treat various design tasks in a unified manner. Our model also supports image generation by predicting discrete image tokens through a specialized tokenizer with support for image transparency. We evaluate MarkupDM on three tasks, attribute value, image, and text completion, and demonstrate that it can produce plausible designs consistent with the given context. To further illustrate the flexibility of our approach, we evaluate our approach on a new instruction-guided design completion task where our instruction-tuned MarkupDM compares favorably to state-of-the-art image editing models, especially in textual completion. These findings suggest that multimodal language models with our document representation can serve as a versatile foundation for broad design automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nian Wu, Miaomiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method, named geodesic deformable networks (GDN), that for the first time enables the learning of geodesic flows of deformation fields derived from images. In particular, the capability of our proposed GDN being able to predict geodesics is important for quantifying and comparing deformable shape presented in images. The geodesic deformations, also known as optimal transformations that align pairwise images, are often parameterized by a time sequence of smooth vector fields governed by nonlinear differential equations. A bountiful literature has been focusing on learning the initial conditions (e.g., initial velocity fields) based on registration networks. However, the definition of geodesics central to deformation-based shape analysis is blind to the networks. To address this problem, we carefully develop an efficient neural operator to treat the geodesics as unknown mapping functions learned from the latent deformation spaces. A composition of integral operators and smooth activation functions is then formulated to effectively approximate such mappings. In contrast to previous works, our GDN jointly optimizes a newly defined geodesic loss, which adds additional benefits to promote the network regularizability and generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDN on both 2D synthetic data and 3D real brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankit Dhiman, Tao Lu, R Srinath, Emre Arslan, Angela Xing, Yuanbo Xiangli, R Venkatesh Babu, Srinath Sridhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel-view synthesis is an important problem in computer vision with applications in 3D reconstruction, mixed reality, and robotics. Recent methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have become the preferred method for this task, providing high-quality novel views in real time. However, the training time of a 3DGS model is slow, often taking 30 minutes for a scene with 200 views. In contrast, our goal is to reduce the optimization time by training for fewer steps while maintaining high rendering quality. Specifically, we combine the guidance from both the position error and the appearance error to achieve a more effective densification. To balance the rate between adding new Gaussians and fitting old Gaussians, we develop a convergence-aware budget control mechanism. Moreover, to make the densification process more reliable, we selectively add new Gaussians from mostly visited regions. With these designs, we reduce the Gaussian optimization steps to one-third of the previous approach while achieving a comparable or even better novel view rendering quality. To further facilitate the rapid fitting of 4K resolution images, we introduce a dilation-based rendering technique. Our method, Turbo-GS, speeds up optimization for typical scenes and scales well to high-resolution (4K) scenarios on standard datasets. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method is significantly faster in optimization than other methods while retaining quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chendong Wang, Anlan Zhang, Yifan Yang, Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Xinyang Jiang, Feng Qian, Suman Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in digital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video content poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth requirement. A natural approach to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce the volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to transmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details. While super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced for 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for volumetric videos.
  To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video streaming, we have developed VoLUT with a new SR algorithm specifically designed for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of lookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of low-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to quickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We further apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine the downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the selected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, VoLUT is the first to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate. Our evaluation shows VoLUT can reduce bandwidth usage by 70% , boost QoE by 36.7% for volumetric video streaming and achieve
  3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonjeong Ha, Xiaomeng Jin, Jeonghwan Kim, Jiateng Liu, Zhenhailong Wang, Khanh Duy Nguyen, Ansel Blume, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models enable rapid concept design, making them widely used in AI-driven design. While recent studies focus on generating semantic and stylistic variations of given design concepts, functional coherence--the integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept--remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances. Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ding, Rui Sun, Yunjian Zhang, Xiu Yan, Yueqi Zhou, Kaihao Huang, Suzhong Fu, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero, Chuanlong Xie, Yao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth-wise pruning accelerates LLM inference in resource-constrained scenarios but suffers from performance degradation due to direct removal of entire Transformer layers. This paper reveals ``Patch-like'' redundancy across layers via correlation analysis of the outputs of different layers in reproducing kernel Hilbert space, demonstrating consecutive layers exhibit high functional similarity. Building on this observation, this paper proposes Sliding-Window Merging (SWM) - a dynamic compression method that selects consecutive layers from top to bottom using a pre-defined similarity threshold, and compacts patch-redundant layers through a parameter consolidation, thereby simplifying the model structure while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments on LLMs with various architectures and different parameter scales show that our method outperforms existing pruning techniques in both zero-shot inference performance and retraining recovery quality after pruning. In particular, in the experiment with 35% pruning on the Vicuna-7B model, our method achieved a 1.654% improvement in average performance on zero-shot tasks compared to the existing method. Moreover, we further reveal the potential of combining depth pruning with width pruning to enhance the pruning effect.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Yu, Mengyang Zhao, Jinghui Lu, Ke Niu, Yanjie Wang, Weijie Yin, Weitao Jia, Teng Fu, Yang Liu, Jun Liu, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Video subtitles play a crucial role in short videos and movies, as they not only help models better understand video content but also support applications such as video translation and content retrieval. Existing video subtitle extraction methods typically rely on multi-stage frameworks, where errors accumulate across stages and temporal dependencies are underutilized due to frame-wise processing. Moreover, although some Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) possess strong OCR capabilities, predicting accurate timestamps for subtitle texts remains challenging. To this end, we propose an End-to-end Video subtitle Extraction framework based on LVLMs, named EVE, which can output subtitles and their timestamps simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch Spatiotemporal Subtitle-Salient (S\textsuperscript{3}) Module that serves as an adapter for LVLMs, capable of representing subtitle-related content and considering inter-frame correlations using only a small number of tokens. Within this module, the Spatial Semantic Context Aggregate branch aggregates high-level global semantics to provide spatial visual contextual information, while the Temporal Subtitle Token Query branch explicitly queries subtitle-relevant tokens while considering temporal correlation across frames. The small number of tokens retained by the S\textsuperscript{3} module are fed to the language model, which then directly outputs the subtitle text along with its timestamps. Furthermore, we construct the first large-scale dataset dedicated to video subtitle extraction, ViSa, containing over 2.5M videos with timestamped and bilingual annotation, thereby providing the community with a well-organized training and evaluation benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghao Zhang, Tao Zhong, Yan Xia, Mushui Liu, Zhelun Yu, Haoyuan Li, Wanggui He, Fangxun Shu, Dong She, Yi Wang, Hao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: While previous multimodal slow-thinking methods have demonstrated remarkable success in single-image understanding scenarios, their effectiveness becomes fundamentally constrained when extended to more complex multi-image comprehension tasks. This limitation stems from their predominant reliance on text-based intermediate reasoning processes. While for human, when engaging in sophisticated multi-image analysis, they typically perform two complementary cognitive operations: (1) continuous cross-image visual comparison through region-of-interest matching, and (2) dynamic memorization of critical visual concepts throughout the reasoning chain. Motivated by these observations, we propose the Complex Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (CMMCoT) framework, a multi-step reasoning framework that mimics human-like "slow thinking" for multi-image understanding. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) The construction of interleaved multimodal multi-step reasoning chains, which utilize critical visual region tokens, extracted from intermediate reasoning steps, as supervisory signals. This mechanism not only facilitates comprehensive cross-modal understanding but also enhances model interpretability. (2) The introduction of a test-time memory augmentation module that expands the model's reasoning capacity during inference while preserving parameter efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate research in this direction, we have curated a novel multi-image slow-thinking dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gorjan Radevski, Teodora Popordanoska, Matthew B. Blaschko, Tinne Tuytelaars</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual understanding is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to integrate and interpret information from both auditory and visual modalities. Despite recent advances in multi-modal learning, existing benchmarks often suffer from strong visual bias -- when answers can be inferred from visual data alone -- and provide only aggregate scores that conflate multiple sources of error. This makes it difficult to determine whether models struggle with visual understanding, audio interpretation, or audio-visual alignment. In this work, we introduce DAVE: Diagnostic Audio Visual Evaluation, a novel benchmark dataset designed to systematically evaluate audio-visual models across controlled settings. DAVE alleviates existing limitations by (i) ensuring both modalities are necessary to answer correctly and (ii) decoupling evaluation into atomic subcategories. Our detailed analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals specific failure modes and provides targeted insights for improvement. By offering this standardized diagnostic framework, we aim to facilitate more robust development of audio-visual models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshen Xu, Yuting Mei, Xinbi Liu, Sipeng Zheng, Qin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric video-language pretraining has significantly advanced video representation learning. Humans perceive and interact with a fully 3D world, developing spatial awareness that extends beyond text-based understanding. However, most previous works learn from 1D text or 2D visual cues, such as bounding boxes, which inherently lack 3D understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoDTM, an Egocentric Depth- and Text-aware Model, jointly trained through large-scale 3D-aware video pretraining and video-text contrastive learning. EgoDTM incorporates a lightweight 3D-aware decoder to efficiently learn 3D-awareness from pseudo depth maps generated by depth estimation models. To further facilitate 3D-aware video pretraining, we enrich the original brief captions with hand-object visual cues by organically combining several foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate EgoDTM's superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its superior 3D-aware visual understanding. Code: https://github.com/xuboshen/EgoDTM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jangho Park, Taesung Kwon, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view or 4D video generation has emerged as a significant research topic. Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: While text-to-image generative models can synthesize diverse and faithful content, subject variation across multiple generations limits their application to long-form content generation. Existing approaches require time-consuming fine-tuning, reference images for all subjects, or access to previously generated content. We introduce Contrastive Concept Instantiation (CoCoIns), a framework that effectively synthesizes consistent subjects across multiple independent generations. The framework consists of a generative model and a mapping network that transforms input latent codes into pseudo-words associated with specific concept instances. Users can generate consistent subjects by reusing the same latent codes. To construct such associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the network to distinguish between different combinations of prompts and latent codes. Extensive evaluations on human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs comparably to existing methods while maintaining greater flexibility. We also demonstrate the potential for extending CoCoIns to multiple subjects and other object categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changsheng Lv, Zijian Fu, Mengshi Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose Robo-SGG, a plug-and-play module for robust scene graph generation (SGG). Unlike standard SGG, the robust scene graph generation aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images, with the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted images. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to shifted visual features (e.g., corruption interference or occlusions). To obtain robust visual features, we leverage layout information, representing the global structure of an image, which is robust to domain shift, to enhance the robustness of SGG methods under corruption. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization (IN) to alleviate the domain-specific variations and recover the robust structural features (i.e., the positional and semantic relationships among objects) by the proposed Layout-Oriented Restitution. Furthermore, under corrupted images, we introduce a Layout-Embedded Encoder (LEE) that adaptively fuses layout and visual features via a gating mechanism, enhancing the robustness of positional and semantic representations for objects and predicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a plug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the state-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative improvements of 6.3%, 11.1%, and 8.0% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet tasks on the VG-C benchmark, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance in the corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C).

<p>Abstract: Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is a promising research direction, which simulates human interaction with computers or mobile phones to perform diverse GUI tasks. However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: The visually impaired population faces significant challenges in daily activities. While prior works employ vision language models for assistance, most focus on static content and cannot address real-time perception needs in complex environments. Recent VideoLLMs enable real-time vision and speech interaction, offering promising potential for assistive tasks. In this work, we conduct the first study evaluating their effectiveness in supporting daily life for visually impaired individuals. We first conducted a user survey with visually impaired participants to design the benchmark VisAssistDaily for daily life evaluation. Using VisAssistDaily, we evaluate popular VideoLLMs and find GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. We further conduct a user study to reveal concerns about hazard perception. To address this, we propose SafeVid, an environment-awareness dataset, and fine-tune VITA-1.5, improving risk recognition accuracy from 25.00% to 76.00%.We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xintong Zhang, Zhi Gao, Bofei Zhang, Pengxiang Li, Xiaowen Zhang, Yang Liu, Tao Yuan, Yuwei Wu, Yunde Jia, Song-Chun Zhu, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a variety of computer vision tasks. However, the multimodal reasoning capability has not been fully explored in existing models. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Focus (CoF) method that allows VLMs to perform adaptive focusing and zooming in on key image regions based on obtained visual cues and the given questions, achieving efficient multimodal reasoning. To enable this CoF capability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent designed to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with different image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome accuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling further refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human priors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On the V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model outperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to 4K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed CoF method and facilitating the more efficient deployment of VLMs in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theodore Barfoot, Luis C. Garcia-Peraza-Herrera, Samet Akcay, Ben Glocker, Tom Vercauteren</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident, compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Xu, Xinyu Wei, Sam Wells, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as the Gate Shift Module (GSM) or the Gate Shift Fuse to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose Multi-Focus Temporal Shifting Module (MFS) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal shifts and Group Focus Module, enabling efficient modeling of both short and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MFS is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly with diverse 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia dataset, the first PES benchmark for table tennis containing over 4,800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES benchmarks demonstrate that MFS consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, achieving leading results among lightweight methods (+4.09 mAP, 45 GFLOPs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Wang, Zhendong Yang, Liansong Zong, Xiaobo Zhang, Dexian Wang, Ji Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress, state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches. Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Wang, Moran Li, Xiaobin Hu, Ran Yi, Jiangning Zhang, Chengming Xu, Weijian Cao, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under large face poses, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT architectures, and the lack of targeted coverage of large face poses in existing open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we propose Collaborative Face Experts Fusion (CoFE), which dynamically fuses complementary signals from three specialized experts within the DiT backbone: an identity expert that captures cross-pose invariant features, a semantic expert that encodes high-level visual context, and a detail expert that preserves pixel-level attributes such as skin texture and color gradients. Second, we introduce a data curation pipeline comprising three key components: Face Constraints to ensure diverse large-pose coverage, Identity Consistency to maintain stable identity across frames, and Speech Disambiguation to align textual captions with actual speaking behavior. This pipeline yields LaFID-180K, a large-scale dataset of pose-annotated video clips designed for identity-preserving video generation. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in face similarity, FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. \href{https://rain152.github.io/CoFE/}{Project page}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wen, Hang Yu, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather, and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog and snow conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Petr Ko\v{s}\v{t}\'al, Pavel Kord\'ik, Ond\v{r}ej Podsztavek</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making. However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5 km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are unavailable, we train models on a high-resolution observational gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We cannot evaluate downscaled climate projections with common metrics (e.g. pixel-wise root-mean-square error) because we lack ground-truth high-resolution climate projections. Therefore, we evaluate climate indicators computed at weather station locations. Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahindra Singh Rautela, Alexander Most, Siddharth Mansingh, Bradley C. Love, Ayan Biswas, Diane Oyen, Earl Lawrence</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761">MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yapeng Mi, Hengli Li, Yanpeng Zhao, Chenxi Li, Huimin Wu, Xiaojian Ma, Song-Chun Zhu, Ying Nian Wu, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance in various domains, including image generation. However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunpeng Chen, Changwei Wang, Rongtao Xu, Xingtian Pei, Yukun Song, Jinzhou Lin, Wenhao Xu, Jingyi Zhang, Li Guo, Shibiao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25998">VRWKV-Editor: Reducing quadratic complexity in transformer-based video editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelilah Aitrouga, Youssef Hmamouche, Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni</p>
<p>Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method. However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation. We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our approach on real-world object captures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshit Singh, Shyam Marjit, Wei Lin, Paul Gavrikov, Serena Yeung-Levy, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, Sivan Doveh, James Glass, M. Jehanzeb Mirza</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale, Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12 everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14 interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object 3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

<p>Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet. Specifically, our diffusion model reaches an FID of 1.58 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 number of function evaluations (NFE) surpassing prior pixel-space methods and VAE-based counterparts by a large margin in both generation quality and training efficiency. In a direct comparison, our model significantly outperforms DiT while using only around 30\% of its training compute.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling, due to their reliance on processing excessive redundant visual tokens. To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of individual teeth from panoramic radiographs remains a challenging task due to anatomical variations, irregular tooth shapes, and overlapping structures. These complexities often limit the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose DE-KAN, a novel Dual Encoder Kolmogorov Arnold Network, which enhances feature representation and segmentation precision. The framework employs a ResNet-18 encoder for augmented inputs and a customized CNN encoder for original inputs, enabling the complementary extraction of global and local spatial features. These features are fused through KAN-based bottleneck layers, incorporating nonlinear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem to improve learning capacity and interpretability. Extensive experiments on two benchmark dental X-ray datasets demonstrate that DE-KAN outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving mIoU of 94.5%, Dice coefficient of 97.1%, accuracy of 98.91%, and recall of 97.36%, representing up to +4.7% improvement in Dice compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayong Liu, Chao Xu, Weihong Chen, Suyu Zhang, Juncheng Wang, Jiankang Deng, Baigui Sun, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results as decision-making engines for embodied agents operating in complex, physical environments. However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Zheng, Zhenkai Wu, Fupeng Wei, Miaolan Zhou, Kai Lie, Haitao Guo, Lei Ding, Wei Zhang, Hang-Cheng Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. The multi-scale cross-attention mechanism allows for precise localization of subtle semantic changes, while the difference siamese structure enhances inter-class feature discrimination, enabling fine-grained semantic change detection. Furthermore, a simple yet powerful lightweight decoder is designed to generate clear detection maps while maintaining high efficiency. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. We evaluated our method on the Gaza-Change and two classical datasets: the SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the MCD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuhao Yang, Sudong Wang, Kaichen Zhang, Keming Wu, Sicong Leng, Yifan Zhang, Bo Li, Chengwei Qin, Shijian Lu, Xingxuan Li, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Adorni, Minh-Tan Pham, St\'ephane May, S\'ebastien Lef\`evre</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs. All codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/pierreadorni/EoS-FM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world, agentic settings where outputs must not only be correct, but also conform to predefined data schemas. Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Xiaowei Xu, Shuai Wang, Chenhui Zhu, Ruxue Wen, Xubin Li, Tiezheng Ge, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruosen Zhao, Zhikang Zhang, Jialei Xu, Jiahao Chang, Dong Chen, Lingyun Li, Weijian Sun, Zizhuang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Mohiuddin, Syed Mohammod Minhaz Hossain, Sumaiya Khanam, Prionkar Barua, Aparup Barua, MD Tamim Hossain</p>
<p>Abstract: Yoga is a popular form of exercise worldwide due to its spiritual and physical health benefits, but incorrect postures can lead to injuries. Automated yoga pose classification has therefore gained importance to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. While human pose keypoint extraction models have shown high potential in action recognition, systematic benchmarking for yoga pose recognition remains limited, as prior works often focus solely on raw images or a single pose extraction model. In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception), using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross-validation analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Gerard A. Villanueva, Priyanka Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and timely diagnosis of multi-class skin lesions is hampered by subjective methods, inherent data imbalance in datasets like HAM10000, and the "black box" nature of Deep Learning (DL) models. This study proposes a trustworthy and highly accurate Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to overcome these limitations. The approach utilizes Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for per class data augmentation to resolve the critical class imbalance problem. A fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier is then trained on the augmented dataset to classify seven skin disease categories. Crucially, LIME and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to provide transparency by confirming that predictions are based on clinically relevant features like irregular morphology. The system achieved a high overall Accuracy of 92.50 % and a Macro-AUC of 98.82 %, successfully outperforming various prior benchmarked architectures. This work successfully validates a verifiable framework that combines high performance with the essential clinical interpretability required for safe diagnostic deployment. Future research should prioritize enhancing discrimination for critical categories, such as Melanoma NOS (F1-Score is 0.8602).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusen Hei, Jiali Chen, Jinyu Yang, Mengchen Zhao, Yi Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors in complex video reasoning scenarios, correcting these errors is critical for uncovering their weaknesses and improving performance. However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose ViRectify, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30K instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In ViRectify, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our ViRectify serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on ViRectify, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe ViRectify provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding visual differences between dynamic scenes requires the comparative perception of compositional, spatial, and temporal changes--a capability that remains underexplored in existing vision-language systems. While prior work on Image Difference Captioning (IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities. We hope ViDiC-1K can be a challenging benchmark that lays a solid foundation for advancing video understanding, edit awareness, and comparative reasoning in multimodal intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghun Ryou, Inju Ha, Sanghyeok Chu, Bohyung Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based image restoration has achieved significant success. However, when addressing real-world degradations, model performance is limited by the quality of ground-truth images in datasets due to practical constraints in data acquisition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that enhances existing ground truth images to provide higher-quality supervision for real-world restoration. Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the quality of restored images. We further validate the effectiveness of both supervision enhancement and output refinement through user studies. Code is available at https://github.com/dhryougit/Beyond-the-Ground-Truth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wu, Li Yang, Gen Zhan, Yabin Zhang, Yiting Liao, Junlin Li, Deliang Fu, Li Zhang, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the temporal understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for advancing long-form video analysis, enabling tasks such as temporal localization, action detection, and time-sensitive question answering. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs.</p>

ImageNot is designed to test the external validity of deep learning progress on ImageNet. We show that key model architectures developed for ImageNet over the years rank identically to how they rank on ImageNet when trained from scratch and evaluated on ImageNot. Moreover, the relative improvements of each model over earlier models strongly correlate in both datasets. Our work demonstrates a surprising degree of external validity in the relative performance of image classification models when trained and evaluated on an entirely different dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Pirillo, Luca Colombo, Manuel Roveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is a pivotal technique for managing the growing computational and memory demands of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By reducing the number of bits used to represent weights and activations (typically from 32-bit Floating-Point (FP) to 16-bit or 8-bit integers), quantization reduces memory footprint, energy consumption, and execution time of DNNs. However, most existing methods typically target DNN inference, while training still relies on FP operations, limiting applicability in environments where FP arithmetic is unavailable. To date, only one prior work has addressed integer-only training, and only for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. This paper introduces NITRO-D, a novel framework for training deep integer-only Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that operate entirely in the integer domain for both training and inference. NITRO-D enables training of integer CNNs without requiring a separate quantization scheme. Specifically, it introduces a novel architecture that integrates multiple local-loss blocks, which include the proposed NITRO-Scaling layer and NITRO-ReLU activation function. The proposed framework also features a novel learning algorithm that employs local error signals and leverages IntegerSGD, an optimizer specifically designed for integer computations. NITRO-D is implemented as an open-source Python library. Extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art image recognition datasets demonstrate its effectiveness. For integer-only MLPs, NITRO-D improves test accuracy by up to +5.96% over the state-of-the-art. It also successfully trains integer-only CNNs, reducing memory requirements and energy consumption by up to 76.14% and 32.42%, respectively, compared to the traditional FP backpropagation algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect AI deepfakes and fraudulent activities in online payment systems. With the growing prevalence of deepfake technology, which can manipulate facial features in images and videos, the potential for fraud in online transactions has escalated. Traditional security systems struggle to identify these sophisticated forms of fraud. This research proposes a novel GAN-based model that enhances online payment security by identifying subtle manipulations in payment images. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of real-world online payment images and deepfake images generated using advanced GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN and DeepFake. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately distinguish between legitimate transactions and deepfakes, achieving a high detection rate above 95%. This approach significantly improves the robustness of payment systems against AI-driven fraud. The paper contributes to the growing field of digital security, offering insights into the application of GANs for fraud detection in financial services.

<p>Abstract: We introduce ENTIRE, a novel deep learning-based approach for fast and accurate volume rendering time prediction. Predicting rendering time is inherently challenging due to its dependence on multiple factors, including volume data characteristics, image resolution, camera configuration, and transfer function settings. Our method addresses this by first extracting a feature vector that encodes structural volume properties relevant to rendering performance. This feature vector is then integrated with additional rendering parameters, such as image resolution, camera setup, and transfer function settings, to produce the final prediction. We evaluate ENTIRE across multiple rendering frameworks (CPU- and GPU-based) and configurations (with and without single-scattering) on diverse datasets. The results demonstrate that our model achieves high prediction accuracy with fast inference speed. Furthermore, we showcase ENTIRE's effectiveness in two case studies, where it enables dynamic parameter adaptation for stable frame rates and load balancing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Leiva, Noel Ngu, Joshua Shay Kricheli, Aditya Taparia, Ransalu Senanayake, Paulo Shakarian, Nathaniel Bastian, John Corcoran, Gerardo Simari</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Wang, Zhenhua Liu, Jiaheng Wei, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Li, Javad Sohankar, Ji Luo, Jing Li, Yi Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The global population is aging rapidly, and aging is a major risk factor for various diseases. It is an important task to predict how each individual's brain will age, as the brain supports many human functions. This capability can greatly facilitate healthcare automation by enabling personalized, proactive intervention and efficient healthcare resource allocation. However, this task is extremely challenging because of the brain's complex 3D anatomy. While there have been successes in natural image generation and brain MRI synthesis, existing methods fall short in generating individualized, anatomically faithful aging brain trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPath, a novel AI model that, given a single structural MRI of an individual, generates synthetic longitudinal MRIs that represent that individual's expected brain anatomy as they age. BrainPath introduces three architectural innovations: an age-aware encoder with biologically grounded supervision, a differential age conditioned decoder for anatomically faithful MRI synthesis, and a swap-learning strategy that implicitly separates stable subject-specific anatomy from aging effects. We further design biologically informed loss functions, including an age calibration loss and an age and structural perceptual loss, to complement the conventional reconstruction loss. This enables the model to capture subtle, temporally meaningful anatomical changes associated with aging. We apply BrainPath to two of the largest public aging datasets and conduct a comprehensive, multifaceted evaluation. Our results demonstrate BrainPath's superior performance in generation accuracy, anatomical fidelity, and cross-dataset generalizability, outperforming competing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marshall Thomas, Edward Fish, Richard Bowden</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), traditional single modality end-to-end approaches consistently fail on two critical components of natural signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in SLT with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names, places, and technical terms. We introduce SignBind-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign, ChicagoFSWildPlus, and BOBSL datasets with a BLEU-4 score of 22.1, 73.2% letter accuracy and BLEU-4 score of 6.8 respectively. These results validate our core hypothesis: isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusion provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasmine Shone, Zhening Li, Shaden Alshammari, Mark Hamilton, William Freeman</p>
<p>Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23 representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points. However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative statistical divergences. Key findings: (1) on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance; (2) supervised contrastive learning with Euclidean distance as the feature space metric is improved by replacing the standard loss function with Jenson-Shannon divergence (JSD); (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL with a bounded $f$-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of considering divergence choices in representation learning optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyu Luo, Haodong Li, Xinxing Cheng, He Zhao, Yang Hu, Xuan Song, Tianyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09568">VEDA: 3D Molecular Generation via Variance-Exploding Diffusion with Annealing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peining Zhang, Jinbo Bi, Minghu Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiwei Liang, Boyang Cai, Minghao Lai, Sitong Zhuang, Tao Lin, Yan Qin, Yixuan Ye, Jiaming Liang, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite strong results on recognition and segmentation, current 3D visual pre-training methods often underperform on robotic manipulation. We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shravan Chaudhari, Yoav Wald, Suchi Saria</p>
<p>Abstract: As we deploy machine learning systems in the real world, a core challenge is to maintain a model that is performant even as the data shifts. Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call the background distribution, is fixed. In this paper we develop CoLOR, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make CoLOR scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that CoLOR significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work.</p>
