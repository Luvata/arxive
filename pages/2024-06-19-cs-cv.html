<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengxiang Wang, Hongzhen Wang, Di Wang, Zonghao Guo, Zhenyu Zhong, Long Lan, Jing Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a pivotal approach for developing foundational visual models in the field of remote sensing (RS). However, current RS datasets are limited in volume and diversity, which significantly constrains the capacity of MIM methods to learn generalizable representations. In this study, we introduce \textbf{RS-4M}, a large-scale dataset designed to enable highly efficient MIM training on RS images. RS-4M comprises 4 million optical images encompassing abundant and fine-grained RS visual tasks, including object-level detection and pixel-level segmentation. Compared to natural images, RS images often contain massive redundant background pixels, which limits the training efficiency of the conventional MIM models. To address this, we propose an efficient MIM method, termed \textbf{SelectiveMAE}, which dynamically encodes and reconstructs a subset of patch tokens selected based on their semantic richness. SelectiveMAE roots in a progressive semantic token selection module, which evolves from reconstructing semantically analogical tokens to encoding complementary semantic dependencies. This approach transforms conventional MIM training into a progressive feature learning process, enabling SelectiveMAE to efficiently learn robust representations of RS images. Extensive experiments show that SelectiveMAE significantly boosts training efficiency by 2.2-2.7 times and enhances the classification, detection, and segmentation performance of the baseline MIM model.The dataset, source code, and trained models will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Sureddy, Dishant Padalia, Nandhinee Periyakaruppa, Oindrila Saha, Adina Williams, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Megan Richards, Polina Kirichenko, Melissa Hall</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has identified substantial disparities in generated images of different geographic regions, including stereotypical depictions of everyday objects like houses and cars. However, existing measures for these disparities have been limited to either human evaluations, which are time-consuming and costly, or automatic metrics evaluating full images, which are unable to attribute these disparities to specific parts of the generated images. In this work, we introduce a new set of metrics, Decomposed Indicators of Disparities in Image Generation (Decomposed-DIG), that allows us to separately measure geographic disparities in the depiction of objects and backgrounds in generated images. Using Decomposed-DIG, we audit a widely used latent diffusion model and find that generated images depict objects with better realism than backgrounds and that backgrounds in generated images tend to contain larger regional disparities than objects. We use Decomposed-DIG to pinpoint specific examples of disparities, such as stereotypical background generation in Africa, struggling to generate modern vehicles in Africa, and unrealistically placing some objects in outdoor settings. Informed by our metric, we use a new prompting structure that enables a 52% worst-region improvement and a 20% average improvement in generated background diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongting Zhang, Lu Chen, Guodong Zheng, Yifeng Gao, Rui Zheng, Jinlan Fu, Zhenfei Yin, Senjie Jin, Yu Qiao, Xuanjing Huang, Feng Zhao, Tao Gui, Jing Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) has brought unprecedented advances in understanding multimodal information. The combination of textual and visual semantics in VLMs is highly complex and diverse, making the safety alignment of these models challenging. Furthermore, due to the limited study on the safety alignment of VLMs, there is a lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Safety Preference Alignment dataset for Vision Language Models named SPA-VL. In terms of breadth, SPA-VL covers 6 harmfulness domains, 13 categories, and 53 subcategories, and contains 100,788 samples of the quadruple (question, image, chosen response, rejected response). In terms of depth, the responses are collected from 12 open- (e.g., QwenVL) and closed-source (e.g., Gemini) VLMs to ensure diversity. The experimental results indicate that models trained with alignment techniques on the SPA-VL dataset exhibit substantial improvements in harmlessness and helpfulness while maintaining core capabilities. SPA-VL, as a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset, represents a significant milestone in ensuring that VLMs achieve both harmlessness and helpfulness. We have made our code https://github.com/EchoseChen/SPA-VL-RLHF and SPA-VL dataset url https://huggingface.co/datasets/sqrti/SPA-VL publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12042">Not All Prompts Are Made Equal: Prompt-based Pruning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Ganjdanesh, Reza Shirkavand, Shangqian Gao, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive image generation capabilities. Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP's effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g., prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyi Zhang, Yufan Zhou, Jiuxiang Gu, Curtis Wigington, Tong Yu, Yiran Chen, Tong Sun, Ruiyi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating a broad spectrum of visual content, yet their proficiency in rendering text is still limited: they often generate inaccurate characters or words that fail to blend well with the underlying image. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new framework named ARTIST. This framework incorporates a dedicated textual diffusion model to specifically focus on the learning of text structures. Initially, we pretrain this textual model to capture the intricacies of text representation. Subsequently, we finetune a visual diffusion model, enabling it to assimilate textual structure information from the pretrained textual model. This disentangled architecture design and the training strategy significantly enhance the text rendering ability of the diffusion models for text-rich image generation. Additionally, we leverage the capabilities of pretrained large language models to better interpret user intentions, contributing to improved generation quality. Empirical results on the MARIO-Eval benchmark underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing an improvement of up to 15\% in various metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Artemyev, Anna Vorontsova, Anna Sokolova, Alexander Limonov</p>
<p>Abstract: The majority of modern single-view depth estimation methods predict relative depth and thus cannot be directly applied in many real-world scenarios, despite impressive performance in the benchmarks. Moreover, single-view approaches cannot guarantee consistency across a sequence of frames. Consistency is typically addressed with test-time optimization of discrepancy across views; however, it takes hours to process a single scene. In this paper, we present MEDeA, an efficient multi-view test-time depth adjustment method, that is an order of magnitude faster than existing test-time approaches. Given RGB frames with camera parameters, MEDeA predicts initial depth maps, adjusts them by optimizing local scaling coefficients, and outputs temporally-consistent depth maps. Contrary to test-time methods requiring normals, optical flow, or semantics estimation, MEDeA produces high-quality predictions with a depth estimation network solely. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on TUM RGB-D, 7Scenes, and ScanNet benchmarks and successfully handles smartphone-captured data from ARKitScenes dataset.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12054">FAWN: Floor-And-Walls Normal Regularization for Direct Neural TSDF Reconstruction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Sokolova, Anna Vorontsova, Bulat Gabdullin, Alexander Limonov</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging 3D semantics for direct 3D reconstruction has a great potential yet unleashed. For instance, by assuming that walls are vertical, and a floor is planar and horizontal, we can correct distorted room shapes and eliminate local artifacts such as holes, pits, and hills. In this paper, we propose FAWN, a modification of truncated signed distance function (TSDF) reconstruction methods, which considers scene structure by detecting walls and floor in a scene, and penalizing the corresponding surface normals for deviating from the horizontal and vertical directions. Implemented as a 3D sparse convolutional module, FAWN can be incorporated into any trainable pipeline that predicts TSDF. Since FAWN requires 3D semantics only for training, no additional limitations on further use are imposed. We demonstrate, that FAWN-modified methods use semantics more effectively, than existing semantic-based approaches. Besides, we apply our modification to state-of-the-art TSDF reconstruction methods, and demonstrate a quality gain in SCANNET, ICL-NUIM, TUM RGB-D, and 7SCENES benchmarks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12079">Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglong Sun, Barath Lakshmanan, Maying Shen, Shiyi Lan, Jingde Chen, Jose Alvarez</p>
<p>Abstract: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models grow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very aggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge devices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and struggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across channels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop a latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency variations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal latency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal pruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning ratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP with a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101 im/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning StreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12080">A Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Representation for Real-Time Rendering of Very Large Datasets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernhard Kerbl, Andr\'eas Meuleman, Georgios Kopanas, Michael Wimmer, Alexandre Lanvin, George Drettakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen major advances in recent years, with 3D Gaussian splatting offering an excellent level of visual quality, fast training and real-time rendering. However, the resources needed for training and rendering inevitably limit the size of the captured scenes that can be represented with good visual quality. We introduce a hierarchy of 3D Gaussians that preserves visual quality for very large scenes, while offering an efficient Level-of-Detail (LOD) solution for efficient rendering of distant content with effective level selection and smooth transitions between levels.We introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that allows us to train very large scenes in independent chunks. We consolidate the chunks into a hierarchy that can be optimized to further improve visual quality of Gaussians merged into intermediate nodes. Very large captures typically have sparse coverage of the scene, presenting many challenges to the original 3D Gaussian splatting training method; we adapt and regularize training to account for these issues. We present a complete solution, that enables real-time rendering of very large scenes and can adapt to available resources thanks to our LOD method. We show results for captured scenes with up to tens of thousands of images with a simple and affordable rig, covering trajectories of up to several kilometers and lasting up to one hour.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matias Gran-Henriksen, Hans Andreas Lindgaard, Gabriel Kiss, Frank Lindseth</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Deep HM-SORT, a novel online multi-object tracking algorithm specifically designed to enhance the tracking of athletes in sports scenarios. Traditional multi-object tracking methods often struggle with sports environments due to the similar appearances of players, irregular and unpredictable movements, and significant camera motion. Deep HM-SORT addresses these challenges by integrating deep features, harmonic mean, and Expansion IOU. By leveraging the harmonic mean, our method effectively balances appearance and motion cues, significantly reducing ID-swaps. Additionally, our approach retains all tracklets indefinitely, improving the re-identification of players who leave and re-enter the frame. Experimental results demonstrate that Deep HM-SORT achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale public benchmarks, SportsMOT and SoccerNet Tracking Challenge 2023. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1 HOTA on the SportsMOT dataset and 85.4 HOTA on the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset, outperforming existing trackers in key metrics such as HOTA, IDF1, AssA, and MOTA. This robust solution provides enhanced accuracy and reliability for automated sports analytics, offering significant improvements over previous methods without introducing additional computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Susmelj, Mael Macuglia, Nata\v{s}a Tagasovska, Reto Sutter, Sebastiano Caprara, Jean-Philippe Thiran, Ender Konukoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit functions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), occupancy networks, and signed distance functions (SDFs) have become pivotal in computer vision for reconstructing detailed object shapes from sparse views. Achieving optimal performance with these models can be challenging due to the extreme sparsity of inputs and distribution shifts induced by data corruptions. To this end, large, noise-free synthetic datasets can serve as shape priors to help models fill in gaps, but the resulting reconstructions must be approached with caution. Uncertainty estimation is crucial for assessing the quality of these reconstructions, particularly in identifying areas where the model is uncertain about the parts it has inferred from the prior. In this paper, we introduce Dropsembles, a novel method for uncertainty estimation in tuned implicit functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments, starting with toy examples and progressing to a real-world scenario. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Occupancy Network on synthetic anatomical data and test it on low-resolution MRI segmentations of the lumbar spine. Our results show that Dropsembles achieve the accuracy and calibration levels of deep ensembles but with significantly less computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Wang, Seung Wook Kim, Jiawei Yang, Cunjun Yu, Boris Ivanovic, Steven L. Waslander, Yue Wang, Sanja Fidler, Marco Pavone, Peter Karkus</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose DistillNeRF, a self-supervised learning framework addressing the challenge of understanding 3D environments from limited 2D observations in autonomous driving. Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets for training, thereby helping our model to learn 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features.

<p>Abstract: This work proposes a novel representation of injective deformations of 3D space, which overcomes existing limitations of injective methods: inaccuracy, lack of robustness, and incompatibility with general learning and optimization frameworks. The core idea is to reduce the problem to a deep composition of multiple 2D mesh-based piecewise-linear maps. Namely, we build differentiable layers that produce mesh deformations through Tutte's embedding (guaranteed to be injective in 2D), and compose these layers over different planes to create complex 3D injective deformations of the 3D volume. We show our method provides the ability to efficiently and accurately optimize and learn complex deformations, outperforming other injective approaches. As a main application, we produce complex and artifact-free NeRF and SDF deformations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinrui Zu, Qian Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in sampling and editing multi-modal data with high generation quality, yet they suffer from the iterative generation process which is computationally expensive and slow. In addition, most methods are constrained to generate data from Gaussian noise, which limits their sampling and editing flexibility. To overcome both disadvantages, we present Contrastive Optimal Transport Flow (COT Flow), a new method that achieves fast and high-quality generation with improved zero-shot editing flexibility compared to previous diffusion models. Benefiting from optimal transport (OT), our method has no limitation on the prior distribution, enabling unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation and doubling the editable space (at both the start and end of the trajectory) compared to other zero-shot editing methods. In terms of quality, COT Flow can generate competitive results in merely one step compared to previous state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation methods. To highlight the advantages of COT Flow through the introduction of OT, we introduce the COT Editor to perform user-guided editing with excellent flexibility and quality. The code will be released at https://github.com/zuxinrui/cot_flow.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12173">MiSuRe is all you need to explain your image segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Nouman Hasany, Fabrice M\'eriaudeau, Caroline Petitjean</p>
<p>Abstract: The last decade of computer vision has been dominated by Deep Learning architectures, thanks to their unparalleled success. Their performance, however, often comes at the cost of explainability owing to their highly non-linear nature. Consequently, a parallel field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has developed with the aim of generating insights regarding the decision making process of deep learning models. An important problem in XAI is that of the generation of saliency maps. These are regions in an input image which contributed most towards the model's final decision. Most work in this regard, however, has been focused on image classification, and image segmentation - despite being a ubiquitous task - has not received the same attention. In the present work, we propose MiSuRe (Minimally Sufficient Region) as an algorithm to generate saliency maps for image segmentation. The goal of the saliency maps generated by MiSuRe is to get rid of irrelevant regions, and only highlight those regions in the input image which are crucial to the image segmentation decision. We perform our analysis on 3 datasets: Triangle (artificially constructed), COCO-2017 (natural images), and the Synapse multi-organ (medical images). Additionally, we identify a potential usecase of these post-hoc saliency maps in order to perform post-hoc reliability of the segmentation model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Chen, Nathan Lay, Stephanie Harmon, Kutsev Ozyoruk, Enis Yilmaz, Brad J. Wood, Peter A. Pinto, Peter L. Choyke, Baris Turkbey</p>
<p>Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in the world. While deep learning has potential to further improve computer-aided prostate cancer detection on MRI, its efficacy hinges on the exhaustive curation of manually annotated images. We propose a novel methodology of semisupervised learning (SSL) guided by automatically extracted clinical information, specifically the lesion locations in radiology reports, allowing for use of unannotated images to reduce the annotation burden. By leveraging lesion locations, we refined pseudo labels, which were then used to train our location-based SSL model. We show that our SSL method can improve prostate lesion detection by utilizing unannotated images, with more substantial impacts being observed when larger proportions of unannotated images are used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiada Lu, WeiWei Zhou, Xiang Qian, Dongze Lian, Yanyu Xu, Weifeng Wang, Lina Cao, Shenghua Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Repetitive action counting quantifies the frequency of specific actions performed by individuals. However, existing action-counting datasets have limited action diversity, potentially hampering model performance on unseen actions. To address this issue, we propose a framework called First Cycle Annotated Repetitive Action Counting (FCA-RAC). This framework contains 4 parts: 1) a labeling technique that annotates each training video with the start and end of the first action cycle, along with the total action count. This technique enables the model to capture the correlation between the initial action cycle and subsequent actions; 2) an adaptive sampling strategy that maximizes action information retention by adjusting to the speed of the first annotated action cycle in videos; 3) a Multi-Temporal Granularity Convolution (MTGC) module, that leverages the muli-scale first action as a kernel to convolve across the entire video. This enables the model to capture action variations at different time scales within the video; 4) a strategy called Training Knowledge Augmentation (TKA) that exploits the annotated first action cycle information from the entire dataset. This allows the network to harness shared characteristics across actions effectively, thereby enhancing model performance and generalizability to unseen actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior outcomes on RepCount-A and related datasets, highlighting the efficacy of our framework in improving model performance on seen and unseen actions. Our paper makes significant contributions to the field of action counting by addressing the limitations of existing datasets and proposing novel techniques for improving model generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Beliy, Navve Wasserman, Amit Zalcher, Michal Irani</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-fMRI encoding is important for both neuroscience research and practical applications. However, such "Brain-Encoders" have been typically trained per-subject and per fMRI-dataset, thus restricted to very limited training data. In this paper we propose a Universal Brain-Encoder, which can be trained jointly on data from many different subjects/datasets/machines. What makes this possible is our new voxel-centric Encoder architecture, which learns a unique "voxel-embedding" per brain-voxel. Our Encoder trains to predict the response of each brain-voxel on every image, by directly computing the cross-attention between the brain-voxel embedding and multi-level deep image features. This voxel-centric architecture allows the functional role of each brain-voxel to naturally emerge from the voxel-image cross-attention. We show the power of this approach to (i) combine data from multiple different subjects (a "Crowd of Brains") to improve each individual brain-encoding, (ii) quick & effective Transfer-Learning across subjects, datasets, and machines (e.g., 3-Tesla, 7-Tesla), with few training examples, and (iii) use the learned voxel-embeddings as a powerful tool to explore brain functionality (e.g., what is encoded where in the brain).</p>

<p>Abstract: This report presents our team's 'PCIE_LAM' solution for the Ego4D Looking At Me Challenge at CVPR2024. The main goal of the challenge is to accurately determine if a person in the scene is looking at the camera wearer, based on a video where the faces of social partners have been localized. Our proposed solution, InternLSTM, consists of an InternVL image encoder and a Bi-LSTM network. The InternVL extracts spatial features, while the Bi-LSTM extracts temporal features. However, this task is highly challenging due to the distance between the person in the scene and the camera movement, which results in significant blurring in the face image. To address the complexity of the task, we implemented a Gaze Smoothing filter to eliminate noise or spikes from the output. Our approach achieved the 1st position in the looking at me challenge with 0.81 mAP and 0.93 accuracy rate. Code is available at https://github.com/KanokphanL/Ego4D_LAM_InternLSTM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongpeng Pan, Shifeng Yi, Shouwei Yang, Lei Qi, Bing Hu, Yi Xu, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This report introduces an enhanced method for the Foundational Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task, leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for object detection. However, on specific datasets, VLM may encounter the problem where the detected targets are misaligned with the target concepts of interest. This misalignment hinders the zero-shot performance of VLM and the application of fine-tuning methods based on pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose the VLM+ framework, which integrates the multimodal large language model (MM-LLM). Specifically, we use MM-LLM to generate a series of referential expressions for each category. Based on the VLM predictions and the given annotations, we select the best referential expression for each category by matching the maximum IoU. Subsequently, we use these referential expressions to generate pseudo-labels for all images in the training set and then combine them with the original labeled data to fine-tune the VLM. Additionally, we employ iterative pseudo-label generation and optimization to further enhance the performance of the VLM. Our approach achieve 32.56 mAP in the final test.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaxin Zhang, Xiaohao Xu, Xiang Wang, Jialong Zuo, Chuchu Han, Xiaonan Huang, Changxin Gao, Yuehuan Wang, Nong Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Towards open-ended Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), existing methods often exhibit biased detection when faced with challenging or unseen events and lack interpretability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Holmes-VAD, a novel framework that leverages precise temporal supervision and rich multimodal instructions to enable accurate anomaly localization and comprehensive explanations. Firstly, towards unbiased and explainable VAD system, we construct the first large-scale multimodal VAD instruction-tuning benchmark, i.e., VAD-Instruct50k. This dataset is created using a carefully designed semi-automatic labeling paradigm. Efficient single-frame annotations are applied to the collected untrimmed videos, which are then synthesized into high-quality analyses of both abnormal and normal video clips using a robust off-the-shelf video captioner and a large language model (LLM). Building upon the VAD-Instruct50k dataset, we develop a customized solution for interpretable video anomaly detection. We train a lightweight temporal sampler to select frames with high anomaly response and fine-tune a multimodal large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory content. Extensive experimental results validate the generality and interpretability of the proposed Holmes-VAD, establishing it as a novel interpretable technique for real-world video anomaly analysis. To support the community, our benchmark and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAD.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we present our champion solution for EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval Challenge in CVPR 2024.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyojin Kim, Jiyoon Lee, Yonghyun Jeong, Haneol Jang, YoungJoon Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel perspective for enhancing anti-spoofing performance in zero-shot data domain generalization. Unlike traditional image classification tasks, face anti-spoofing datasets display unique generalization characteristics, necessitating novel zero-shot data domain generalization. One step forward to the previous frame-wise spoofing prediction, we introduce a nuanced metric calculation that aggregates frame-level probabilities for a video-wise prediction, to tackle the gap between the reported frame-wise accuracy and instability in real-world use-case. This approach enables the quantification of bias and variance in model predictions, offering a more refined analysis of model generalization. Our investigation reveals that simply scaling up the backbone of models does not inherently improve the mentioned instability, leading us to propose an ensembled backbone method from a Bayesian perspective. The probabilistically ensembled backbone both improves model robustness measured from the proposed metric and spoofing accuracy, and also leverages the advantages of measuring uncertainty, allowing for enhanced sampling during training that contributes to model generalization across new datasets. We evaluate the proposed method from the benchmark OMIC dataset and also the public CelebA-Spoof and SiW-Mv2. Our final model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across the datasets, showcasing advancements in Bias, Variance, HTER, and AUC metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Agriculture-Vision Challenge at CVPR 2024 aims at leveraging semantic segmentation models to produce pixel level semantic segmentation labels within regions of interest for multi-modality satellite images. It is one of the most famous and competitive challenges for global researchers to break the boundary between computer vision and agriculture sectors. However, there is a serious class imbalance problem in the agriculture-vision dataset, which hinders the semantic segmentation performance. To solve this problem, firstly, we propose a mosaic data augmentation with a rare class sampling strategy to enrich long-tail class samples. Secondly, we employ an adaptive class weight scheme to suppress the contribution of the common classes while increasing the ones of rare classes. Thirdly, we propose a probability post-process to increase the predicted value of the rare classes. Our methodology achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.547 on the test set, securing second place in this challenge.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12275">VoCo-LLaMA: Towards Vision Compression with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xubing Ye, Yukang Gan, Xiaoke Huang, Yixiao Ge, Ying Shan, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, but they are often bottlenecked by the limited context window and high computational cost of processing high-resolution image inputs and videos. Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count. Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss. However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. By introducing Vision Compression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens. VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage. Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of 576$\times$, resulting in up to 94.8$\%$ fewer FLOPs and 69.6$\%$ acceleration in inference time. Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks. Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs' contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodong Li, Haicheng Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of small objects in aerial images is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. Moving objects in aerial photography have problems such as different shapes and sizes, dense overlap, occlusion by the background, and object blur, however, the original YOLO algorithm has low overall detection accuracy due to its weak ability to perceive targets of different scales. In order to improve the detection accuracy of densely overlapping small targets and fuzzy targets, this paper proposes a dynamic-attention scale-sequence fusion algorithm (DASSF) for small target detection in aerial images. First, we propose a dynamic scale sequence feature fusion (DSSFF) module that improves the up-sampling mechanism and reduces computational load. Secondly, a x-small object detection head is specially added to enhance the detection capability of small targets. Finally, in order to improve the expressive ability of targets of different types and sizes, we use the dynamic head (DyHead). The model we proposed solves the problem of small target detection in aerial images and can be applied to multiple different versions of the YOLO algorithm, which is universal. Experimental results show that when the DASSF method is applied to YOLOv8, compared to YOLOv8n, on the VisDrone-2019 and DIOR datasets, the model shows an increase of 9.2% and 2.4% in the mean average precision (mAP), respectively, and outperforms the current mainstream methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12293">Unleashing the Potential of Open-set Noisy Samples Against Label Noise for Medical Image Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehui Liao, Shishuai Hu, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of addressing mixed closed-set and open-set label noise in medical image classification remains largely unexplored. Unlike natural image classification where there is a common practice of segregation and separate processing of closed-set and open-set noisy samples from clean ones, medical image classification faces difficulties due to high inter-class similarity which complicates the identification of open-set noisy samples. Moreover, prevailing methods do not leverage the full potential of open-set noisy samples for label noise mitigation, often leading to their exclusion or application of uniform soft labels. To address these issues, we propose an Extended Noise-robust Contrastive and Open-set Feature Augmentation (ENCOFA) framework. ENCOFA includes the Extended Noise-robust Supervised Contrastive (ENSC) Loss, which aids in distinguishing features across classes. The ENSC loss regards open-set noisy samples as an extended class and mitigates label noise by weighting contrastive pairs with label reliability. Furthermore, we develop an Open-set Feature Augmentation (OSFeatAug) module that enriches the features of open-set samples, utilizing the model's extra capacity to prevent overfitting to noisy data. We conducted experiments on a synthetic noisy dataset and a real-world noisy dataset. Our results indicate the superiority of ENCOFA and the effectiveness of leveraging the open-set noisy samples to combat label noise.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12303">Immiscible Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Training with Noise Assignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Li, Heyang Jiang, Akio Kodaira, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer, Chenfeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we point out suboptimal noise-data mapping leads to slow training of diffusion models. During diffusion training, current methods diffuse each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscible phenomenon in physics, we propose Immiscible Diffusion, a simple and effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Thus, immiscibility means that the mixing of the molecular sources is distinguishable. Inspired by this, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy. Specifically, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to separate the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only one line of code to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. This ensures that each image is projected only to nearby noise. To address the high complexity of the assignment algorithm, we employ a quantized-assignment method to reduce the computational overhead to a negligible level. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieve up to 3x faster training for consistency models and DDIM on the CIFAR dataset, and up to 1.3x faster on CelebA datasets for consistency models. Besides, we conduct thorough analysis about the Immiscible Diffusion, which sheds lights on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving the fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Wu, Bingliang Jiao, Wenxuan Wang, Meng Liu, Peng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI ReID) aims to match visible and infrared images of the same pedestrians across non-overlapped camera views. These two input modalities contain both invariant information, such as shape, and modality-specific details, such as color. An ideal model should utilize valuable information from both modalities during training for enhanced representational capability. However, the gap caused by modality-specific information poses substantial challenges for the VI ReID model to handle distinct modality inputs simultaneously. To address this, we introduce the Modality-aware and Instance-aware Visual Prompts (MIP) network in our work, designed to effectively utilize both invariant and specific information for identification. Specifically, our MIP model is built on the transformer architecture. In this model, we have designed a series of modality-specific prompts, which could enable our model to adapt to and make use of the specific information inherent in different modality inputs, thereby reducing the interference caused by the modality gap and achieving better identification. Besides, we also employ each pedestrian feature to construct a group of instance-specific prompts. These customized prompts are responsible for guiding our model to adapt to each pedestrian instance dynamically, thereby capturing identity-level discriminative clues for identification. Through extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets, the effectiveness of both our designed modules is evaluated. Additionally, our proposed MIP performs better than most state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most existing deep learning-based registration methods are trained on single-type images to address same-domain tasks.However, cross-domain deformable registration remains challenging.We argue that the tailor-made matching criteria in traditional registration methods is one of the main reason they are applicable in different domains.Motivated by this, we devise a registration-oriented encoder to model the matching criteria of image features and structural features, which is beneficial to boost registration accuracy and adaptability.Specifically, a general feature encoder (Encoder-G) is proposed to capture comprehensive medical image features, while a structural feature encoder (Encoder-S) is designed to encode the structural self-similarity into the global representation.Extensive experiments on images from three different domains prove the efficacy of the proposed method. Moreover, by updating Encoder-S using one-shot learning, our method can effectively adapt to different domains.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JuliusWang-7/EncoderReg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honglei Zhang, Jukka I. Ahonen, Nam Le, Ruiying Yang, Francesco Cricri</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the efficacy of jointly optimizing content-specific post-processing filters to adapt a human oriented video/image codec into a codec suitable for machine vision tasks. By observing that artifacts produced by video/image codecs are content-dependent, we propose a novel training strategy based on competitive learning principles. This strategy assigns training samples to filters dynamically, in a fuzzy manner, which further optimizes the winning filter on the given sample. Inspired by simulated annealing optimization techniques, we employ a softmax function with a temperature variable as the weight allocation function to mitigate the effects of random initialization. Our evaluation, conducted on a system utilizing multiple post-processing filters within a Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec framework, demonstrates the superiority of content-specific filters trained with our proposed strategies, specifically, when images are processed in blocks. Using VVC reference software VTM 12.0 as the anchor, experiments on the OpenImages dataset show an improvement in the BD-rate reduction from -41.3% and -44.6% to -42.3% and -44.7% for object detection and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, compared to independently trained filters. The statistics of the filter usage align with our hypothesis and underscore the importance of jointly optimizing filters for both content and reconstruction quality. Our findings pave the way for further improving the performance of video/image codecs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Akbarian Bafghi, Nidhin Harilal, Claire Monteleoni, Maziar Raissi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces DiffMix, a new self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training framework that combines real and synthetic images. Unlike traditional SSL methods that predominantly use real images, DiffMix uses a variant of Stable Diffusion to replace an augmented instance of a real image, facilitating the learning of cross real-synthetic image representations. The key insight is that while SSL methods trained solely on synthetic images underperform compared to those trained on real images, a blended training approach using both real and synthetic images leads to more robust and adaptable representations. Experiments demonstrate that DiffMix enhances the SSL methods SimCLR, BarlowTwins, and DINO, across various robustness datasets and domain transfer tasks. DiffMix boosts SimCLR's accuracy on ImageNet-1K by 4.56\%. These results challenge the notion that high-quality real images are crucial for SSL pre-training by showing that lower quality synthetic images can also produce strong representations. DiffMix also reduces the need for image augmentations in SSL, offering new optimization strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Jian Ding, Mohamed Elhoseiny</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new benchmark designed to advance the development of general-purpose, large-scale vision-language models for remote sensing images. Although several vision-language datasets in remote sensing have been proposed to pursue this goal, existing datasets are typically tailored to single tasks, lack detailed object information, or suffer from inadequate quality control. Exploring these improvement opportunities, we present a Versatile vision-language Benchmark for Remote Sensing image understanding, termed VRSBench. This benchmark comprises 29,614 images, with 29,614 human-verified detailed captions, 52,472 object references, and 123,221 question-answer pairs. It facilitates the training and evaluation of vision-language models across a broad spectrum of remote sensing image understanding tasks. We further evaluated state-of-the-art models on this benchmark for three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering. Our work aims to significantly contribute to the development of advanced vision-language models in the field of remote sensing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexiong Ding, Xiaowei Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Though current object detection models based on deep learning have achieved excellent results on many conventional benchmark datasets, their performance will dramatically decline on real-world images taken under extreme conditions. Existing methods either used image augmentation based on traditional image processing algorithms or applied customized and scene-limited image adaptation technologies for robust modeling. This study thus proposes a stylization data-driven neural-image-adaptive YOLO (SDNIA-YOLO), which improves the model's robustness by enhancing image quality adaptively and learning valuable information related to extreme weather conditions from images synthesized by neural style transfer (NST). Experiments show that the developed SDNIA-YOLOv3 achieves significant mAP@.5 improvements of at least 15% on the real-world foggy (RTTS) and lowlight (ExDark) test sets compared with the baseline model. Besides, the experiments also highlight the outstanding potential of stylization data in simulating extreme weather conditions. The developed SDNIA-YOLO remains excellent characteristics of the native YOLO to a great extent, such as end-to-end one-stage, data-driven, and fast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexiong Ding, Mengtian Yin, Ran Wei, Ioannis Brilakis, Muyang Liu, Xiaowei Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating geometric digital twins (gDT) for as-built roads still faces many challenges, such as low automation level and accuracy, limited asset types and shapes, and reliance on engineering experience. A novel scan-to-building information modeling (scan-to-BIM) framework is proposed for automatic road gDT creation based on semantically labeled point cloud data (PCD), which considers six asset types: Road Surface, Road Side (Slope), Road Lane (Marking), Road Sign, Road Light, and Guardrail. The framework first segments the semantic PCD into spatially independent instances or parts, then extracts the sectional polygon contours as their representative geometric information, stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files using a new data structure. Primitive gDTs are finally created from JSON files using corresponding conversion algorithms. The proposed method achieves an average distance error of 1.46 centimeters and a processing speed of 6.29 meters per second on six real-world road segments with a total length of 1,200 meters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gesture is an important mean of non-verbal communication, with visual modality allows human to convey information during interaction, facilitating peoples and human-machine interactions. However, it is considered difficult to automatically recognise gestures. In this work, we explore three different means to recognise hand signs using deep learning: supervised learning based methods, self-supervised methods and visualisation based techniques applied to 3D moving skeleton data. Self-supervised learning used to train fully connected, CNN and LSTM method. Then, reconstruction method is applied to unlabelled data in simulated settings using CNN as a backbone where we use the learnt features to perform the prediction in the remaining labelled data. Lastly, Grad-CAM is applied to discover the focus of the models. Our experiments results show that supervised learning method is capable to recognise gesture accurately, with self-supervised learning increasing the accuracy in simulated settings. Finally, Grad-CAM visualisation shows that indeed the models focus on relevant skeleton joints on the associated gesture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David B. Adrian, Andras Gabor Kupcsik, Markus Spies, Heiko Neumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot manipulation relying on learned object-centric descriptors became popular in recent years. Visual descriptors can easily describe manipulation task objectives, they can be learned efficiently using self-supervision, and they can encode actuated and even non-rigid objects. However, learning robust, view-invariant keypoints in a self-supervised approach requires a meticulous data collection approach involving precise calibration and expert supervision. In this paper we introduce Cycle-Correspondence Loss (CCL) for view-invariant dense descriptor learning, which adopts the concept of cycle-consistency, enabling a simple data collection pipeline and training on unpaired RGB camera views. The key idea is to autonomously detect valid pixel correspondences by attempting to use a prediction over a new image to predict the original pixel in the original image, while scaling error terms based on the estimated confidence. Our evaluation shows that we outperform other self-supervised RGB-only methods, and approach performance of supervised methods, both with respect to keypoint tracking as well as for a robot grasping downstream task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Insects represent half of all global biodiversity, yet many of the world's insects are disappearing, with severe implications for ecosystems and agriculture. Despite this crisis, data on insect diversity and abundance remain woefully inadequate, due to the scarcity of human experts and the lack of scalable tools for monitoring. Ecologists have started to adopt camera traps to record and study insects, and have proposed computer vision algorithms as an answer for scalable data processing. However, insect monitoring in the wild poses unique challenges that have not yet been addressed within computer vision, including the combination of long-tailed data, extremely similar classes, and significant distribution shifts. We provide the first large-scale machine learning benchmarks for fine-grained insect recognition, designed to match real-world tasks faced by ecologists. Our contributions include a curated dataset of images from citizen science platforms and museums, and an expert-annotated dataset drawn from automated camera traps across multiple continents, designed to test out-of-distribution generalization under field conditions. We train and evaluate a variety of baseline algorithms and introduce a combination of data augmentation techniques that enhance generalization across geographies and hardware setups. Code and datasets are made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in high-fidelity human reconstruction techniques, the requirements for densely captured images or time-consuming per-instance optimization significantly hinder their applications in broader scenarios. To tackle these issues, we present HumanSplat which predicts the 3D Gaussian Splatting properties of any human from a single input image in a generalizable manner. In particular, HumanSplat comprises a 2D multi-view diffusion model and a latent reconstruction transformer with human structure priors that adeptly integrate geometric priors and semantic features within a unified framework. A hierarchical loss that incorporates human semantic information is further designed to achieve high-fidelity texture modeling and better constrain the estimated multiple views. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrate that HumanSplat surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in achieving photorealistic novel-view synthesis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12463">LFMamba: Light Field Image Super-Resolution with State Space Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang xia, Yao Lu, Shunzhou Wang, Ziqi Wang, Peiqi Xia, Tianfei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) owing to the progress of modern neural networks. However, these methods often face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies (CNN-based) or encounter quadratic computational complexities (Transformer-based), which limit their performance. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM) with selective scanning mechanism (S6), exemplified by Mamba, has emerged as a superior alternative in various vision tasks compared to traditional CNN- and Transformer-based approaches, benefiting from its effective long-range sequence modeling capability and linear-time complexity. Therefore, integrating S6 into LFSR becomes compelling, especially considering the vast data volume of 4D light fields. However, the primary challenge lies in \emph{designing an appropriate scanning method for 4D light fields that effectively models light field features}. To tackle this, we employ SSMs on the informative 2D slices of 4D LFs to fully explore spatial contextual information, complementary angular information, and structure information. To achieve this, we carefully devise a basic SSM block characterized by an efficient SS2D mechanism that facilitates more effective and efficient feature learning on these 2D slices. Based on the above two designs, we further introduce an SSM-based network for LFSR termed LFMamba. Experimental results on LF benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of LFMamba. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy and generalization ability of our proposed method. We expect that our LFMamba shed light on effective representation learning of LFs with state space models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linrui Xu, Ling Zhao, Wang Guo, Qiujun Li, Kewang Long, Kaiqi Zou, Yuhan Wang, Haifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The remote sensing image intelligence understanding model is undergoing a new profound paradigm shift which has been promoted by multi-modal large language model (MLLM), i.e. from the paradigm learning a domain model (LaDM) shifts to paradigm learning a pre-trained general foundation model followed by an adaptive domain model (LaGD). Under the new LaGD paradigm, the old datasets, which have led to advances in RSI intelligence understanding in the last decade, are no longer suitable for fire-new tasks. We argued that a new dataset must be designed to lighten tasks with the following features: 1) Generalization: training model to learn shared knowledge among tasks and to adapt to different tasks; 2) Understanding complex scenes: training model to understand the fine-grained attribute of the objects of interest, and to be able to describe the scene with natural language; 3) Reasoning: training model to be able to realize high-level visual reasoning. In this paper, we designed a high-quality, diversified, and unified multimodal instruction-following dataset for RSI understanding produced by GPT-4V and existing datasets, which we called RS-GPT4V. To achieve generalization, we used a (Question, Answer) which was deduced from GPT-4V via instruction-following to unify the tasks such as captioning and localization; To achieve complex scene, we proposed a hierarchical instruction description with local strategy in which the fine-grained attributes of the objects and their spatial relationships are described and global strategy in which all the local information are integrated to yield detailed instruction descript; To achieve reasoning, we designed multiple-turn QA pair to provide the reasoning ability for a model. The empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLMs by RS-GPT4V can describe fine-grained information. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/RS-GPT4V.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoyu Yang, Yuan Wang, Daming Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation plays a key role in applications such as autonomous driving and medical image. Although existing real-time semantic segmentation models achieve a commendable balance between accuracy and speed, their multi-path blocks still affect overall speed. To address this issue, this study proposes a Reparameterizable Dual-Resolution Network (RDRNet) dedicated to real-time semantic segmentation. Specifically, RDRNet employs a two-branch architecture, utilizing multi-path blocks during training and reparameterizing them into single-path blocks during inference, thereby enhancing both accuracy and inference speed simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Reparameterizable Pyramid Pooling Module (RPPM) to enhance the feature representation of the pyramid pooling module without increasing its inference time. Experimental results on the Cityscapes, CamVid, and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that RDRNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of both performance and speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhao Lin, Lei Zhu, Jiaxing Shen, Huazhu Fu, Qing Zhang, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of depth sensor, more and more RGB-D videos could be obtained. Identifying the foreground in RGB-D videos is a fundamental and important task. However, the existing salient object detection (SOD) works only focus on either static RGB-D images or RGB videos, ignoring the collaborating of RGB-D and video information. In this paper, we first collect a new annotated RGB-D video SOD (ViDSOD-100) dataset, which contains 100 videos within a total of 9,362 frames, acquired from diverse natural scenes. All the frames in each video are manually annotated to a high-quality saliency annotation. Moreover, we propose a new baseline model, named attentive triple-fusion network (ATF-Net), for RGB-D video salient object detection. Our method aggregates the appearance information from an input RGB image, spatio-temporal information from an estimated motion map, and the geometry information from the depth map by devising three modality-specific branches and a multi-modality integration branch. The modality-specific branches extract the representation of different inputs, while the multi-modality integration branch combines the multi-level modality-specific features by introducing the encoder feature aggregation (MEA) modules and decoder feature aggregation (MDA) modules. The experimental findings conducted on both our newly introduced ViDSOD-100 dataset and the well-established DAVSOD dataset highlight the superior performance of the proposed ATF-Net. This performance enhancement is demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art techniques across various domains, including RGB-D saliency detection, video saliency detection, and video object segmentation.

<p>Abstract: Automated cephalometric landmark detection is crucial in real-world orthodontic diagnosis. Current studies mainly focus on only adult subjects, neglecting the clinically crucial scenario presented by adolescents whose landmarks often exhibit significantly different appearances compared to adults. Hence, an open question arises about how to develop a unified and effective detection algorithm across various age groups, including adolescents and adults. In this paper, we propose CeLDA, the first work for Cephalometric Landmark Detection across Ages. Our method leverages a prototypical network for landmark detection by comparing image features with landmark prototypes. To tackle the appearance discrepancy of landmarks between age groups, we design new strategies for CeLDA to improve prototype alignment and obtain a holistic estimation of landmark prototypes from a large set of training images. Moreover, a novel prototype relation mining paradigm is introduced to exploit the anatomical relations between the landmark prototypes. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of CeLDA in detecting cephalometric landmarks on both adult and adolescent subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first effort toward developing a unified solution and dataset for cephalometric landmark detection across age groups. Our code and dataset will be made public on https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/Cephalometric-Landmark-Detection-across-Ages-with-Prototypical-Network</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Mao, Xuesong Yin, Yuanqi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.</p>

Further, our research contributions include an observational analysis of the model's limitations. Moreover, we investigate the model's behavior in response to ablation leakage-inducing prompts, which aim to indirectly ablate concepts, revealing insights into the model's resilience and adaptability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiang-Xin Shi, Chi Zhang, Tong Wei, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown powerful zero-shot inference ability via image-text matching and prove to be strong few-shot learners in various downstream tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, adapting CLIP to downstream tasks may encounter the following challenges: 1) data may exhibit long-tailed data distributions and might not have abundant samples for all the classes; 2) There might be emerging tasks with new classes that contain no samples at all. To overcome them, we propose a novel framework to achieve efficient and long-tailed generalization, which can be termed as Candle. During the training process, we propose compensating logit-adjusted loss to encourage large margins of prototypes and alleviate imbalance both within the base classes and between the base and new classes. For efficient adaptation, we treat the CLIP model as a black box and leverage the extracted features to obtain visual and textual prototypes for prediction. To make full use of multi-modal information, we also propose cross-modal attention to enrich the features from both modalities. For effective generalization, we introduce virtual prototypes for new classes to make up for their lack of training images. Candle achieves state-of-the-art performance over extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets while substantially reducing the training time, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunny Soni, Aaqib Saeed, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple machines to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing of private training data. Yet, especially for heterogeneous models, a key bottleneck remains the transfer of knowledge gained from each client model with the server. One popular method, FedDF, uses distillation to tackle this task with the use of a common, shared dataset on which predictions are exchanged. However, in many contexts such a dataset might be difficult to acquire due to privacy and the clients might not allow for storage of a large shared dataset. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new method that improves this knowledge distillation method to only rely on a single shared image between clients and server. In particular, we propose a novel adaptive dataset pruning algorithm that selects the most informative crops generated from only a single image. With this, we show that federated learning with distillation under a limited shared dataset budget works better by using a single image compared to multiple individual ones. Finally, we extend our approach to allow for training heterogeneous client architectures by incorporating a non-uniform distillation schedule and client-model mirroring on the server side.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of a deep learning model towards image classification tasks, proposing a novel anchor-based training methodology, named \textit{Online Anchor-based Training} (OAT). The OAT method, guided by the insights provided in the anchor-based object detection methodologies, instead of learning directly the class labels, proposes to train a model to learn percentage changes of the class labels with respect to defined anchors. We define as anchors the batch centers at the output of the model. Then, during the test phase, the predictions are converted back to the original class label space, and the performance is evaluated. The effectiveness of the OAT method is validated on four datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12663">Do More Details Always Introduce More Hallucinations in LVLM-based Image Captioning?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqian Feng, Yunlong Tang, Zeliang Zhang, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in integrating visual and linguistic contexts to produce detailed content, facilitating applications such as image captioning. However, using LVLMs to generate descriptions often faces the challenge of object hallucination (OH), where the output text misrepresents actual objects in the input image. While previous studies attribute the occurrence of OH to the inclusion of more details, our study finds technical flaws in existing metrics, leading to unreliable evaluations of models and conclusions about OH. This has sparked a debate on the question: Do more details always introduce more hallucinations in LVLM-based image captioning?
  In this paper, we address this debate by proposing a novel decoding strategy, Differentiated Beam Decoding (DBD), along with a reliable new set of evaluation metrics: CLIP-Precision, CLIP-Recall, and CLIP-F1. DBD decodes the wealth of information hidden in visual input into distinct language representations called unit facts in parallel. This decoding is achieved via a well-designed differential score that guides the parallel search and candidate screening. The selected unit facts are then aggregated to generate the final caption. Our proposed metrics evaluate the comprehensiveness and accuracy of image captions by comparing the embedding groups of ground-truth image regions and generated text partitions. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that it produces detailed descriptions while maintaining low hallucination levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Tzelepi, Vasileios Mezaris</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we deal with the task of Disturbing Image Detection (DID), exploiting knowledge encoded in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Specifically, we propose to exploit LMM knowledge in a two-fold manner: first by extracting generic semantic descriptions, and second by extracting elicited emotions. Subsequently, we use the CLIP's text encoder in order to obtain the text embeddings of both the generic semantic descriptions and LMM-elicited emotions. Finally, we use the aforementioned text embeddings along with the corresponding CLIP's image embeddings for performing the DID task. The proposed method significantly improves the baseline classification accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the augmented Disturbing Image Detection dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongtao Ge, Guangkai Xu, Zhiyue Zhao, Libo Sun, Zheng Huang, Yanlong Sun, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in discriminative and generative pretraining have yielded geometry estimation models with strong generalization capabilities. While discriminative monocular geometry estimation methods rely on large-scale fine-tuning data to achieve zero-shot generalization, several generative-based paradigms show the potential of achieving impressive generalization performance on unseen scenes by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and fine-tuning on even a small scale of synthetic training data. Frustratingly, these models are trained with different recipes on different datasets, making it hard to find out the critical factors that determine the evaluation performance. Besides, current geometry evaluation benchmarks have two main drawbacks that may prevent the development of the field, i.e., limited scene diversity and unfavorable label quality. To resolve the above issues, (1) we build fair and strong baselines in a unified codebase for evaluating and analyzing the geometry estimation models; (2) we evaluate monocular geometry estimators on more challenging benchmarks for geometry estimation task with diverse scenes and high-quality annotations. Our results reveal that pre-trained using large data, discriminative models such as DINOv2, can outperform generative counterparts with a small amount of high-quality synthetic data under the same training configuration, which suggests that fine-tuning data quality is a more important factor than the data scale and model architecture. Our observation also raises a question: if simply fine-tuning a general vision model such as DINOv2 using a small amount of synthetic depth data produces SOTA results, do we really need complex generative models for depth estimation? We believe this work can propel advancements in geometry estimation tasks as well as a wide range of downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nagur Shareef Shaik, Teja Krishna Cherukuri, Vince Calhoun, Dong Hye Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Schizophrenia is a debilitating, chronic mental disorder that significantly impacts an individual's cognitive abilities, behavior, and social interactions. It is characterized by subtle morphological changes in the brain, particularly in the gray matter. These changes are often imperceptible through manual observation, demanding an automated approach to diagnosis. This study introduces a deep learning methodology for the classification of individuals with Schizophrenia. We achieve this by implementing a diversified attention mechanism known as Spatial Sequence Attention (SSA) which is designed to extract and emphasize significant feature representations from structural MRI (sMRI). Initially, we employ the transfer learning paradigm by leveraging pre-trained DenseNet to extract initial feature maps from the final convolutional block which contains morphological alterations associated with Schizophrenia. These features are further processed by the proposed SSA to capture and emphasize intricate spatial interactions and relationships across volumes within the brain. Our experimental studies conducted on a clinical dataset have revealed that the proposed attention mechanism outperforms the existing Squeeze & Excitation Network for Schizophrenia classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Shete, Dennis Mronga, Ankita Jadhav, Frank Kirchner</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection deals with detecting deviations from established patterns within data. It has various applications like autonomous driving, predictive maintenance, and medical diagnosis. To improve anomaly detection accuracy, transfer learning can be applied to large, pre-trained models and adapt them to the specific application context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for online-adaptive anomaly detection using transfer learning. The approach adapts to different environments by selecting visually similar training images and online fitting a normality model to EfficientNet features extracted from the training subset. Anomaly detection is then performed by computing the Mahalanobis distance between the normality model and the test image features. Different similarity measures (SIFT/FLANN, Cosine) and normality models (MVG, OCSVM) are employed and compared with each other. We evaluate the approach on different anomaly detection benchmarks and data collected in controlled laboratory settings. Experimental results showcase a detection accuracy exceeding 0.975, outperforming the state-of-the-art ET-NET approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Polina Karpikova, Andrei Spiridonov, Anna Vorontsova, Anastasia Yaschenko, Ekaterina Radionova, Igor Medvedev, Alexander Limonov</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-portraits captured from a short distance might look unnatural or even unattractive due to heavy distortions making facial features malformed, and ill-placed head poses. In this paper, we propose SUPER, a novel method of eliminating distortions and adjusting head pose in a close-up face crop. We perform 3D GAN inversion for a facial image by optimizing camera parameters and face latent code, which gives a generated image. Besides, we estimate depth from the obtained latent code, create a depth-induced 3D mesh, and render it with updated camera parameters to obtain a warped portrait. Finally, we apply the visibility-based blending so that visible regions are reprojected, and occluded parts are restored with a generative model. Experiments on face undistortion benchmarks and on our self-collected Head Rotation dataset (HeRo), show that SUPER outperforms previous approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively, opening new possibilities for photorealistic selfie editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyang Ni, Zixing Lei, Yifan Lu, Dingju Wang, Chen Feng, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative perception has garnered considerable attention due to its capacity to address several inherent challenges in single-agent perception, including occlusion and out-of-range issues. However, existing collaborative perception systems heavily rely on precise localization systems to establish a consistent spatial coordinate system between agents. This reliance makes them susceptible to large pose errors or malicious attacks, resulting in substantial reductions in perception performance. To address this, we propose~$\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$, a novel self-localized collaborative perception system, which achieves more holistic and robust collaboration without using an external localization system. The core of~$\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$ is a novel spatial alignment module, which provides the relative poses between agents by effectively matching co-visible objects across agents. We validate our method on both real-world and simulated datasets. The results show that i) $\mathtt{CoBEVGlue}$ achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under arbitrary localization noises and attacks; and ii) the spatial alignment module can seamlessly integrate with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their performance by an average of $57.7\%$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin An, Feng Tian, Sicong Leng, Jiahao Nie, Haonan Lin, QianYing Wang, Guang Dai, Ping Chen, Shijian Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their great success across various multimodal tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are facing a prevalent problem with object hallucinations, where the generated textual responses are inconsistent with ground-truth objects in the given image. This paper investigates various LVLMs and pinpoints attention deficiency toward discriminative local image features as one root cause of object hallucinations. Specifically, LVLMs predominantly attend to prompt-independent global image features, while failing to capture prompt-relevant local features, consequently undermining the visual grounding capacity of LVLMs and leading to hallucinations. To this end, we propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates object hallucinations by exploring an ensemble of global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Our approach exhibits an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is reserved while irrelevant distractions are masked. With the augmented view, a calibrated decoding distribution can be derived by integrating generative global features from the original image and discriminative local features from the augmented image. Extensive experiments show that AGLA consistently mitigates object hallucinations and enhances general perception capability for LVLMs across various discriminative and generative benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Lackel/AGLA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Jiang, Bingkui Tong, Xia Du, Ahmed Alhammadi, Jizhe Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Privacy-sensitive Object Identification (POI) task allocates bounding boxes for privacy-sensitive objects in a scene. The key to POI is settling an object's privacy class (privacy-sensitive or non-privacy-sensitive). In contrast to conventional object classes which are determined by the visual appearance of an object, one object's privacy class is derived from the scene contexts and is subject to various implicit factors beyond its visual appearance. That is, visually similar objects may be totally opposite in their privacy classes. To explicitly derive the objects' privacy class from the scene contexts, in this paper, we interpret the POI task as a visual reasoning task aimed at the privacy of each object in the scene. Following this interpretation, we propose the PrivacyGuard framework for POI. PrivacyGuard contains three stages. i) Structuring: an unstructured image is first converted into a structured, heterogeneous scene graph that embeds rich scene contexts. ii) Data Augmentation: a contextual perturbation oversampling strategy is proposed to create slightly perturbed privacy-sensitive objects in a scene graph, thereby balancing the skewed distribution of privacy classes. iii) Hybrid Graph Generation & Reasoning: the balanced, heterogeneous scene graph is then transformed into a hybrid graph by endowing it with extra "node-node" and "edge-edge" homogeneous paths. These homogeneous paths allow direct message passing between nodes or edges, thereby accelerating reasoning and facilitating the capturing of subtle context changes. Based on this hybrid graph... **For the full abstract, see the original paper.**</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Zhao, Yongshuo Zong, Letian Zhang, Timothy Hospedales</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of applications in natural language processing, with multi-modal LLMs extending these capabilities to integrate and interpret visual data. However, existing benchmarks for visual language models (VLMs) predominantly focus on single-image inputs, neglecting the crucial aspect of multi-image understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Image Relational Benchmark MIRB, designed to evaluate VLMs' ability to compare, analyze, and reason across multiple images. Our benchmark encompasses four categories: perception, visual world knowledge, reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that while open-source VLMs were shown to approach the performance of GPT-4V in single-image tasks, a significant performance gap remains in multi-image reasoning tasks. Our findings also reveal that even the state-of-the-art GPT-4V model struggles with our benchmark, underscoring the need for further research and development in this area. We believe our contribution of MIRB could serve as a testbed for developing the next-generation multi-modal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Xu, Sai Wang, Xinyue Hu, Yutian Lin, Bo Du, Yu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to learn semantic primitives (attributes and objects) from seen compositions and recognize unseen attribute-object compositions. Existing CZSL datasets focus on single attributes, neglecting the fact that objects naturally exhibit multiple interrelated attributes. Real-world objects often possess multiple interrelated attributes, and current datasets' narrow attribute scope and single attribute labeling introduce annotation biases, undermining model performance and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-Attribute Composition (MAC) dataset, encompassing 18,217 images and 11,067 compositions with comprehensive, representative, and diverse attribute annotations. MAC includes an average of 30.2 attributes per object and 65.4 objects per attribute, facilitating better multi-attribute composition predictions. Our dataset supports deeper semantic understanding and higher-order attribute associations, providing a more realistic and challenging benchmark for the CZSL task. We also develop solutions for multi-attribute compositional learning and propose the MM-encoder to disentangling the attributes and objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Hou, Xiaoming Li, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the high-quality results of text-to-image generation, stereotypical biases have been spotted in their generated contents, compromising the fairness of generative models. In this work, we propose to learn adaptive inclusive tokens to shift the attribute distribution of the final generative outputs. Unlike existing de-biasing approaches, our method requires neither explicit attribute specification nor prior knowledge of the bias distribution. Specifically, the core of our method is a lightweight adaptive mapping network, which can customize the inclusive tokens for the concepts to be de-biased, making the tokens generalizable to unseen concepts regardless of their original bias distributions. This is achieved by tuning the adaptive mapping network with a handful of balanced and inclusive samples using an anchor loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous bias mitigation methods without attribute specification while preserving the alignment between generative results and text descriptions. Moreover, our method achieves comparable performance to models that require specific attributes or editing directions for generation. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our adaptive inclusive tokens in mitigating stereotypical bias in text-to-image generation.

<p>Abstract: Histopathological analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has seen a surge in the utilization of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and exploring emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Gu, Yuwei Fang, Ivan Skorokhodov, Peter Wonka, Xinya Du, Sergey Tulyakov, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video editing stands as a cornerstone of digital media, from entertainment and education to professional communication. However, previous methods often overlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local contexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistency edits in the spatiotemporal dimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a unified spatiotemporal VIdeo Adaptation framework for global and local video editing, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First, to ensure local consistency within individual frames, the foundation of VIA is a novel test-time editing adaptation method, which adapts a pre-trained image editing model for improving consistency between potential editing directions and the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local control. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence, we introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that adapts consistent attention variables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole sequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are more faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal context, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potentials for advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object referred to by the query sentence throughout the entire video. Most existing methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we aim to efficiently adapt foundation segmentation models for addressing RVOS from weak supervision with the proposed Grounded Prompting (GroPrompt) framework. More specifically, we propose Text-Aware Prompt Contrastive Learning (TAP-CL) to enhance the association between the position prompts and the referring sentences with only box supervisions, including Text-Contrastive Prompt Learning (TextCon) and Modality-Contrastive Prompt Learning (ModalCon) at frame level and video level, respectively. With the proposed TAP-CL, our GroPrompt framework can generate temporal-consistent yet text-aware position prompts describing locations and movements for the referred object from the video. The experimental results in the standard RVOS benchmarks (Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences, and JHMDB-Sentences) demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed GroPrompt framework given only bounding box weak supervisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing methods for long video understanding primarily focus on videos only lasting tens of seconds, with limited exploration of techniques for handling longer videos. The increased number of frames in longer videos presents two main challenges: difficulty in locating key information and performing long-range reasoning. Thus, we propose DrVideo, a document-retrieval-based system designed for long video understanding. Our key idea is to convert the long-video understanding problem into a long-document understanding task so as to effectively leverage the power of large language models. Specifically, DrVideo transforms a long video into a text-based long document to initially retrieve key frames and augment the information of these frames, which is used this as the system's starting point. It then employs an agent-based iterative loop to continuously search for missing information, augment relevant data, and provide final predictions in a chain-of-thought manner once sufficient question-related information is gathered. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. DrVideo outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with +3.8 accuracy on EgoSchema benchmark (3 minutes), +17.9 in MovieChat-1K break mode, +38.0 in MovieChat-1K global mode (10 minutes), and +30.2 on the LLama-Vid QA dataset (over 60 minutes).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duowang Zhu, Xiaohu Huang, Haiyan Huang, Zhenfeng Shao, Qimin Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing images is essential for tracking environmental changes on the Earth's surface. Despite the success of vision transformers (ViTs) as backbones in numerous computer vision applications, they remain underutilized in change detection, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continue to dominate due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, our study uncovers ViTs' unique advantage in discerning large-scale changes, a capability where CNNs fall short. Capitalizing on this insight, we introduce ChangeViT, a framework that adopts a plain ViT backbone to enhance the performance of large-scale changes. This framework is supplemented by a detail-capture module that generates detailed spatial features and a feature injector that efficiently integrates fine-grained spatial information into high-level semantic learning. The feature integration ensures that ChangeViT excels in both detecting large-scale changes and capturing fine-grained details, providing comprehensive change detection across diverse scales. Without bells and whistles, ChangeViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular high-resolution datasets (i.e., LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD) and one low-resolution dataset (i.e., OSCD), which underscores the unleashed potential of plain ViTs for change detection. Furthermore, thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses validate the efficacy of the introduced modules, solidifying the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ning-Hsu Wang, Yu-Lun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately estimating depth in 360-degree imagery is crucial for virtual reality, autonomous navigation, and immersive media applications. Existing depth estimation methods designed for perspective-view imagery fail when applied to 360-degree images due to different camera projections and distortions, whereas 360-degree methods perform inferior due to the lack of labeled data pairs. We propose a new depth estimation framework that utilizes unlabeled 360-degree data effectively. Our approach uses state-of-the-art perspective depth estimation models as teacher models to generate pseudo labels through a six-face cube projection technique, enabling efficient labeling of depth in 360-degree images. This method leverages the increasing availability of large datasets. Our approach includes two main stages: offline mask generation for invalid regions and an online semi-supervised joint training regime. We tested our approach on benchmark datasets such as Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D, showing significant improvements in depth estimation accuracy, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. Our proposed training pipeline can enhance any 360 monocular depth estimator and demonstrates effective knowledge transfer across different camera projections and data types.

However, performance disparities on specific patient groups pose challenges to their clinical utility, safety, and fairness. This can affect known patient groups - such as those based on sex, age, or disease subtype - as well as previously unknown and unlabeled groups. Furthermore, the root cause of such observed performance disparities is often challenging to uncover, hindering mitigation efforts. In this paper, to address these issues, we leverage Slice Discovery Methods (SDMs) to identify interpretable underperforming subsets of data and formulate hypotheses regarding the cause of observed performance disparities. We introduce a novel SDM and apply it in a case study on the classification of pneumothorax and atelectasis from chest x-rays. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of SDMs in hypothesis formulation and yields an explanation of previously observed but unexplained performance disparities between male and female patients in widely used chest X-ray datasets and models. Our findings indicate shortcut learning in both classification tasks, through the presence of chest drains and ECG wires, respectively. Sex-based differences in the prevalence of these shortcut features appear to cause the observed classification performance gap, representing a previously underappreciated interaction between shortcut learning and model fairness analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinqun Yang, Guanqun Zhou, Wei Sun, Youjian Zhang, Zhongya Wang, Jiahui He, Zhicheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), the presence of metallic implants in patients often leads to disruptive artifacts in the reconstructed images, hindering accurate diagnosis. Recently, a large amount of supervised deep learning-based approaches have been proposed for metal artifact reduction (MAR). However, these methods neglect the influence of initial training weights. In this paper, we have discovered that the uncertainty image computed from the restoration result of initial training weights can effectively highlight high-frequency regions, including metal artifacts. This observation can be leveraged to assist the MAR network in removing metal artifacts. Therefore, we propose an uncertainty constraint (UC) loss that utilizes the uncertainty image as an adaptive weight to guide the MAR network to focus on the metal artifact region, leading to improved restoration. The proposed UC loss is designed to be a plug-and-play method, compatible with any MAR framework, and easily adoptable. To validate the effectiveness of the UC loss, we conduct extensive experiments on the public available Deeplesion and CLINIC-metal dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the UC loss further optimizes the network training process and significantly improves the removal of metal artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guodong Du, Jing Li, Hanting Liu, Runhua Jiang, Shuyang Yu, Yifei Guo, Sim Kuan Goh, Ho-Kin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models, particularly large language models, demands extensive computing resources and can result in varying performance outcomes across different domains and datasets. This paper examines the approach of integrating multiple models from diverse training scenarios into a unified model. This unified model excels across various data domains and exhibits the ability to generalize well on out-of-domain data. We propose a knowledge fusion method named Evolver, inspired by evolutionary algorithms, which does not need further training or additional training data. Specifically, our method involves aggregating the weights of different language models into a population and subsequently generating offspring models through mutation and crossover operations. These offspring models are then evaluated against their parents, allowing for the preservation of those models that show enhanced performance on development datasets. Importantly, our model evolving strategy can be seamlessly integrated with existing model merging frameworks, offering a versatile tool for model enhancement. Experimental results on mainstream language models (i.e., encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) reveal that Evolver outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by large margins.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshuai Hao, Mengchuan Wei, Yifan Yang, Haimei Zhao, Hui Zhang, Yi Zhou, Qiang Wang, Weiming Li, Lingdong Kong, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Driving systems often rely on high-definition (HD) maps for precise environmental information, which is crucial for planning and navigation. While current HD map constructors perform well under ideal conditions, their resilience to real-world challenges, \eg, adverse weather and sensor failures, is not well understood, raising safety concerns. This work introduces MapBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of HD map construction methods against various sensor corruptions. Our benchmark encompasses a total of 29 types of corruptions that occur from cameras and LiDAR sensors. Extensive evaluations across 31 HD map constructors reveal significant performance degradation of existing methods under adverse weather conditions and sensor failures, underscoring critical safety concerns. We identify effective strategies for enhancing robustness, including innovative approaches that leverage multi-modal fusion, advanced data augmentation, and architectural techniques. These insights provide a pathway for developing more reliable HD map construction methods, which are essential for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit and affiliated code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Karakida, Toshihiro Ota, Masato Taki</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have established themselves as the leading neural network model in natural language processing and are increasingly foundational in various domains. In vision, the MLP-Mixer model has demonstrated competitive performance, suggesting that attention mechanisms might not be indispensable. Inspired by this, recent research has explored replacing attention modules with other mechanisms, including those described by MetaFormers. However, the theoretical framework for these models remains underdeveloped. This paper proposes a novel perspective by integrating Krotov's hierarchical associative memory with MetaFormers, enabling a comprehensive representation of the entire Transformer block, encompassing token-/channel-mixing modules, layer normalization, and skip connections, as a single Hopfield network. This approach yields a parallelized MLP-Mixer derived from a three-layer Hopfield network, which naturally incorporates symmetric token-/channel-mixing modules and layer normalization. Empirical studies reveal that symmetric interaction matrices in the model hinder performance in image recognition tasks. Introducing symmetry-breaking effects transitions the performance of the symmetric parallelized MLP-Mixer to that of the vanilla MLP-Mixer. This indicates that during standard training, weight matrices of the vanilla MLP-Mixer spontaneously acquire a symmetry-breaking configuration, enhancing their effectiveness. These findings offer insights into the intrinsic properties of Transformers and MLP-Mixers and their theoretical underpinnings, providing a robust framework for future model design and optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Jin Ahn, Jungwoo Park, Sangha Park, Jonghyun Choi, Kee-Eung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) stands at the intersection of computer vision and speech recognition, aiming to interpret spoken content from visual cues. A prominent challenge in VSR is the presence of homophenes-visually similar lip gestures that represent different phonemes. Prior approaches have sought to distinguish fine-grained visemes by aligning visual and auditory semantics, but often fell short of full synchronization. To address this, we present SyncVSR, an end-to-end learning framework that leverages quantized audio for frame-level crossmodal supervision. By integrating a projection layer that synchronizes visual representation with acoustic data, our encoder learns to generate discrete audio tokens from a video sequence in a non-autoregressive manner. SyncVSR shows versatility across tasks, languages, and modalities at the cost of a forward pass. Our empirical evaluations show that it not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also reduces data usage by up to ninefold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byung-Kwan Lee, Sangyun Chung, Chae Won Kim, Beomchan Park, Yong Man Ro</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language and vision models (LLVMs) have been driven by the generalization power of large language models (LLMs) and the advent of visual instruction tuning. Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Yu, Qi Yang, Han Liu, Ho Hin Lee, Yucheng Tang, Lucas W. Remedios, Michael Kim, Shunxing Bao, Ann Xenobia Moore, Luigi Ferrucci, Bennett A. Landman</p>
<p>Abstract: 2D single-slice abdominal computed tomography (CT) enables the assessment of body habitus and organ health with low radiation exposure. However, single-slice data necessitates the use of 2D networks for segmentation, but these networks often struggle to capture contextual information effectively. Consequently, even when trained on identical datasets, 3D networks typically achieve superior segmentation results. In this work, we propose a novel 3D-to-2D distillation framework, leveraging pre-trained 3D models to enhance 2D single-slice segmentation. Specifically, we extract the prediction distribution centroid from the 3D representations, to guide the 2D student by learning intra- and inter-class correlation. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation methods that require the same data input, our approach employs unpaired 3D CT scans with any contrast to guide the 2D student model. Experiments conducted on 707 subjects from the single-slice Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) dataset demonstrate that state-of-the-art 2D multi-organ segmentation methods can benefit from the 3D teacher model, achieving enhanced performance in single-slice multi-organ segmentation. Notably, our approach demonstrates considerable efficacy in low-data regimes, outperforming the model trained with all available training subjects even when utilizing only 200 training subjects. Thus, this work underscores the potential to alleviate manual annotation burdens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-hsuan Chen, Jonathan Cagan, Levent Burak kara</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing for manufacturing poses significant challenges in part due to the computation bottleneck of Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) simulations. Although deep learning as an alternative offers fast inference, its performance is dependently bounded by the need for abundant training data. Representation learning, particularly through pre-training, offers promise for few-shot learning, aiding in manufacturability tasks where data can be limited. This work introduces VIRL, a Volume-Informed Representation Learning approach to pre-train a 3D geometric encoder. The pretrained model is evaluated across four manufacturability indicators obtained from CAM simulations: subtractive machining (SM) time, additive manufacturing (AM) time, residual von Mises stress, and blade collisions during Laser Power Bed Fusion process. Across all case studies, the model pre-trained by VIRL shows substantial enhancements on demonstrating improved generalizability with limited data and superior performance with larger datasets. Regarding deployment strategy, case-specific phenomenon exists where finetuning VIRL-pretrained models adversely affects AM tasks with limited data but benefits SM time prediction. Moreover, the efficacy of Low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which balances between probing and finetuning, is explored. LoRA shows stable performance akin to probing with limited data, while achieving a higher upper bound than probing as data size increases, without the computational costs of finetuning. Furthermore, static normalization of manufacturing indicators consistently performs well across tasks, while dynamic normalization enhances performance when a reliable task dependent input is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Li, Chen Chen, Zhuang Xiong, Ying Liu, Pengfei Rong, Shanshan Shan, Feng Liu, Hongfu Sun, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MRI phase-based post-processing technique to extract the distribution of tissue susceptibilities, demonstrating significant potential in studying neurological diseases. However, the ill-conditioned nature of dipole inversion makes QSM reconstruction from the tissue field prone to noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based IR2QSM method for QSM reconstruction. It is designed by iterating four times of a reverse concatenations and middle recurrent modules enhanced U-net, which could dramatically improve the efficiency of latent feature utilization. Simulated and in vivo experiments were conducted to compare IR2QSM with several traditional algorithms (MEDI and iLSQR) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (U-net, xQSM, and LPCNN). The results indicated that IR2QSM was able to obtain QSM images with significantly increased accuracy and mitigated artifacts over other methods. Particularly, IR2QSM demonstrated on average the best NRMSE (27.59%) in simulated experiments, which is 15.48%, 7.86%, 17.24%, 9.26%, and 29.13% lower than iLSQR, MEDI, U-net, xQSM, LPCNN, respectively, and led to improved QSM results with fewer artifacts for the in vivo data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Conti, Enrico Fini, Paolo Rota, Yiming Wang, Massimiliano Mancini, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) often requires the creation of ad-hoc evaluations. Currently, building new benchmarks requires tremendous amounts of manual work for each specific analysis. This makes the evaluation process tedious and costly. In this paper, we present APEx, Automatic Programming of Experiments, the first framework for automatic benchmarking of LMMs. Given a research question expressed in natural language, APEx leverages a large language model (LLM) and a library of pre-specified tools to generate a set of experiments for the model at hand, and progressively compile a scientific report. The report drives the testing procedure: based on the current status of the investigation, APEx chooses which experiments to perform and whether the results are sufficient to draw conclusions. Finally, the LLM refines the report, presenting the results to the user in natural language. Thanks to its modularity, our framework is flexible and extensible as new tools become available. Empirically, APEx reproduces the findings of existing studies while allowing for arbitrary analyses and hypothesis testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mattia Litrico, Francesco Guarnera, Valerio Giuffirda, Daniele Rav\`i, Sebastiano Battiato</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic images to accurately predict changes in the structure of brain MRI is a crucial tool for clinicians. Such applications help assess patients' outcomes and analyze how diseases progress at the individual level. However, existing methods for this task present some limitations. Some approaches attempt to model the distribution of MRI scans directly by conditioning the model on patients' ages, but they fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes in the brain and time intervals, especially on age-unbalanced datasets. Other approaches simply rely on interpolation between scans, which limits their clinical application as they do not predict future MRIs. To address these challenges, we propose a Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM), which introduces a novel approach to accurately infer progression in brain MRIs. TADM learns the distribution of structural changes in terms of intensity differences between scans and combines the prediction of these changes with the initial baseline scans to generate future MRIs. Furthermore, during training, we propose to leverage a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) to refine the model's training process, enhancing its ability to produce accurate MRIs that match the expected age gap between baseline and generated scans. Our assessment, conducted on the OASIS-3 dataset, uses similarity metrics and region sizes computed by comparing predicted and real follow-up scans on 3 relevant brain regions. TADM achieves large improvements over existing approaches, with an average decrease of 24% in region size error and an improvement of 4% in similarity metrics. These evaluations demonstrate the improvement of our model in mimicking temporal brain neurodegenerative progression compared to existing methods. Our approach will benefit applications, such as predicting patient outcomes or improving treatments for patients.</p>

The model integrates the SlowFast and Transformer architectures (SFT) to effectively process and classify complex gesture sequences captured in video frames.

<p>Abstract: The emergence of clinical data warehouses (CDWs), which contain the medical data of millions of patients, has paved the way for vast data sharing for research. The quality of MRIs gathered in CDWs differs greatly from what is observed in research settings and reflects a certain clinical reality. Consequently, a significant proportion of these images turns out to be unusable due to their poor quality. Given the massive volume of MRIs contained in CDWs, the manual rating of image quality is impossible. Thus, it is necessary to develop an automated solution capable of effectively identifying corrupted images in CDWs. This study presents an innovative transfer learning method for automated quality control of 3D gradient echo T1-weighted brain MRIs within a CDW, leveraging artefact simulation. We first intentionally corrupt images from research datasets by inducing poorer contrast, adding noise and introducing motion artefacts. Subsequently, three artefact-specific models are pre-trained using these corrupted images to detect distinct types of artefacts. Finally, the models are generalised to routine clinical data through a transfer learning technique, utilising 3660 manually annotated images. The overall image quality is inferred from the results of the three models, each designed to detect a specific type of artefact. Our method was validated on an independent test set of 385 3D gradient echo T1-weighted MRIs. Our proposed approach achieved excellent results for the detection of bad quality MRIs, with a balanced accuracy of over 87%, surpassing our previous approach by 3.5 percent points. Additionally, we achieved a satisfactory balanced accuracy of 79% for the detection of moderate quality MRIs, outperforming our previous performance by 5 percent points. Our framework provides a valuable tool for exploiting the potential of MRIs in CDWs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Lu Huang, Liming Xia, Qian Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) is an increasingly important tool for clinical assessment of cardiovascular diseases. Quantitative maps are derived by fitting a known signal model to a series of baseline images, while the quality of the map can be deteriorated by involuntary respiratory and cardiac motion. To correct motion, a template image is often needed to register all baseline images, but the choice of template is nontrivial, leading to inconsistent performance sensitive to image contrast. In this work, we propose a novel deep-learning-based groupwise registration framework, which omits the need for a template, and registers all baseline images simultaneously. We design two groupwise losses for this registration framework: the first is a linear principal component analysis (PCA) loss that enforces alignment of baseline images irrespective of the intensity variation, and the second is an auxiliary relaxometry loss that enforces adherence of intensity profile to the signal model. We extensively evaluated our method, termed ``PCA-Relax'', and other baseline methods on an in-house cardiac MRI dataset including both pre- and post-contrast $T_1$ sequences. All methods were evaluated under three distinct training-and-evaluation strategies, namely, standard, one-shot, and test-time-adaptation. The proposed PCA-Relax showed further improved performance of registration and mapping over well-established baselines. The proposed groupwise framework is generic and can be adapted to applications involving multiple images.</p>

<p>Abstract: In human interaction, gestures serve various functions such as marking speech rhythm, highlighting key elements, and supplementing information. These gestures are also observed in explanatory contexts. However, the impact of gestures on explanations provided by virtual agents remains underexplored. A user study was carried out to investigate how different types of gestures influence perceived interaction quality and listener understanding. This study addresses the effect of gestures in explanation by developing an embodied virtual explainer integrating both beat gestures and iconic gestures to enhance its automatically generated verbal explanations. Our model combines beat gestures generated by a learned speech-driven synthesis module with manually captured iconic gestures, supporting the agent's verbal expressions about the board game Quarto! as an explanation scenario. Findings indicate that neither the use of iconic gestures alone nor their combination with beat gestures outperforms the baseline or beat-only conditions in terms of understanding. Nonetheless, compared to prior research, the embodied agent significantly enhances understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Vasco, Takuma Seno, Kenta Kawamoto, Kaushik Subramanian, Peter R. Wurman, Peter Stone</p>
<p>Abstract: Racing autonomous cars faster than the best human drivers has been a longstanding grand challenge for the fields of Artificial Intelligence and robotics. Recently, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning agent met this challenge in a high-fidelity racing simulator, Gran Turismo. However, this agent relied on global features that require instrumentation external to the car. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first super-human car racing agent whose sensor input is purely local to the car, namely pixels from an ego-centric camera view and quantities that can be sensed from on-board the car, such as the car's velocity. By leveraging global features only at training time, the learned agent is able to outperform the best human drivers in time trial (one car on the track at a time) races using only local input features. The resulting agent is evaluated in Gran Turismo 7 on multiple tracks and cars. Detailed ablation experiments demonstrate the agent's strong reliance on visual inputs, making it the first vision-based super-human car racing agent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Processing histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSI) leads to massive storage requirements for clinics worldwide. Even after lossy image compression during image acquisition, additional lossy compression is frequently possible without substantially affecting the performance of deep learning-based (DL) downstream tasks. In this paper, we show that the commonly used JPEG algorithm is not best suited for further compression and we propose Stain Quantized Latent Compression (SQLC ), a novel DL based histopathology data compression approach. SQLC compresses staining and RGB channels before passing it through a compression autoencoder (CAE ) in order to obtain quantized latent representations for maximizing the compression. We show that our approach yields superior performance in a classification downstream task, compared to traditional approaches like JPEG, while image quality metrics like the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) is largely preserved. Our method is online available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixia Li, Boya Xiong, Guanhua Chen, Yun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the false positive rate by up to 18.95% and 36.80% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate our approach's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Symac Kim, Junho Moon, Haejun Chung, Ikbeom Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterised by cognitive decline and biomarkers such as tau-proteins. Tau-positron emission tomography (tau-PET), which employs a radiotracer to selectively bind, detect, and visualise tau protein aggregates within the brain, is valuable for early AD diagnosis but is less accessible due to high costs, limited availability, and its invasive nature. Image synthesis with neural networks enables the generation of tau-PET images from more accessible T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. To ensure high-quality image synthesis, we propose a cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss combined with mean squared error and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) losses. The cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss sequentially calculates the axial 2D average perceptual loss for a specified number of epochs, followed by the coronal and sagittal planes for the same number of epochs. This sequence is cyclically performed, with intervals reducing as the cycles repeat. We conduct supervised synthesis of tau-PET images from T1w MRI images using 516 paired T1w MRI and tau-PET 3D images from the ADNI database. For the collected data, we perform preprocessing, including intensity standardisation for tau-PET images from each manufacturer. The proposed loss, applied to generative 3D U-Net and its variants, outperformed those with 2.5D and 3D perceptual losses in SSIM and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). In addition, including the cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss to the original losses of GAN-based image synthesis models such as CycleGAN and Pix2Pix improves SSIM and PSNR by at least 2% and 3%. Furthermore, by-manufacturer PET standardisation helps the models in synthesising high-quality images than min-max PET normalisation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The segmentation foundation model, e.g., Segment Anything Model (SAM), has attracted increasing interest in the medical image community. Early pioneering studies primarily concentrated on assessing and improving SAM's performance from the perspectives of overall accuracy and efficiency, yet little attention was given to the fairness considerations. This oversight raises questions about the potential for performance biases that could mirror those found in task-specific deep learning models like nnU-Net. In this paper, we explored the fairness dilemma concerning large segmentation foundation models. We prospectively curate a benchmark dataset of 3D MRI and CT scans of the organs including liver, kidney, spleen, lung and aorta from a total of 1056 healthy subjects with expert segmentations. Crucially, we document demographic details such as gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) for each subject to facilitate a nuanced fairness analysis. We test state-of-the-art foundation models for medical image segmentation, including the original SAM, medical SAM and SAT models, to evaluate segmentation efficacy across different demographic groups and identify disparities. Our comprehensive analysis, which accounts for various confounding factors, reveals significant fairness concerns within these foundational models. Moreover, our findings highlight not only disparities in overall segmentation metrics, such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient but also significant variations in the spatial distribution of segmentation errors, offering empirical evidence of the nuanced challenges in ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyi Wang, Shiwei Tan, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jincheng Yang, Lishun Wang, Miao Cao, Huan Wang, Yinping Zhao, Xin Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the inverse problem of Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI), which captures a spatial-spectral data cube using snapshot 2D measurements and uses algorithms to reconstruct 3D hyperspectral images (HSI). However, current methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies and non-local similarities. The recently popular Transformer-based methods are poorly deployed on downstream tasks due to the high computational cost caused by self-attention. In this paper, we propose Coarse-Fine Spectral-Aware Deformable Convolution Network (CFSDCN), applying deformable convolutional networks (DCN) to this task for the first time. Considering the sparsity of HSI, we design a deformable convolution module that exploits its deformability to capture long-range dependencies and non-local similarities. In addition, we propose a new spectral information interaction module that considers both coarse-grained and fine-grained spectral similarities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CFSDCN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both simulated and real HSI datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Chen, Xingjun Ma, Difan Zou, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for generative artificial intelligence (AI), the study of their memorization of the raw training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn by memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for more controllable generation and trustworthy application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). While previous works have made important observations of when DPMs are prone to memorization, these findings are mostly empirical, and the developed data extraction methods only work for conditional diffusion models. In this work, we aim to establish a theoretical understanding of memorization in DPMs with 1) a memorization metric for theoretical analysis, 2) an analysis of conditional memorization with informative and random labels, and 3) two better evaluation metrics for measuring memorization. Based on the theoretical analysis, we further propose a novel data extraction method called \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a classifier trained on generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data directly from unconditional diffusion models. Our empirical results demonstrate that SIDE can extract training data from diffusion models where previous methods fail, and it is on average over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angel Daruna, Vasily Zadorozhnyy, Georgina Lukoczki, Han-Pang Chiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM) remains a challenging problem as it requires the analysis of associations between large-scale multi-modal geospatial data and few historical mineral commodity observations (positive labels). Recent MPM works have explored Deep Learning (DL) as a modeling tool with more representation capacity. However, these overparameterized methods may be more prone to overfitting due to their reliance on scarce labeled data. While a large quantity of unlabeled geospatial data exists, no prior MPM works have considered using such information in a self-supervised manner. Our MPM approach uses a masked image modeling framework to pretrain a backbone neural network in a self-supervised manner using unlabeled geospatial data alone. After pretraining, the backbone network provides feature extraction for downstream MPM tasks. We evaluated our approach alongside existing methods to assess mineral prospectivity of Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) and Clastic-Dominated (CD) Lead-Zinc deposits in North America and Australia. Our results demonstrate that self-supervision promotes robustness in learned features, improving prospectivity predictions. Additionally, we leverage explainable artificial intelligence techniques to demonstrate that individual predictions can be interpreted from a geological perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangming Zhu, Huayu Deng, Haochen Yuan, Yunbo Wang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce latent intuitive physics, a transfer learning framework for physics simulation that can infer hidden properties of fluids from a single 3D video and simulate the observed fluid in novel scenes. Our key insight is to use latent features drawn from a learnable prior distribution conditioned on the underlying particle states to capture the invisible and complex physical properties. To achieve this, we train a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, and both the particle states and the visual posterior are obtained from a learned neural renderer. The converged prior learner is embedded in our probabilistic physics engine, allowing us to perform novel simulations on unseen geometries, boundaries, and dynamics without knowledge of the true physical parameters. We validate our model in three ways: (i) novel scene simulation with the learned visual-world physics, (ii) future prediction of the observed fluid dynamics, and (iii) supervised particle simulation. Our model demonstrates strong performance in all three tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Henry Wu, Jing Yu Koh, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Daniel Fried, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-enabled language models (VLMs) are now used to build autonomous multimodal agents capable of taking actions in real environments. In this paper, we show that multimodal agents raise new safety risks, even though attacking agents is more challenging than prior attacks due to limited access to and knowledge about the environment. Our attacks use adversarial text strings to guide gradient-based perturbation over one trigger image in the environment: (1) our captioner attack attacks white-box captioners if they are used to process images into captions as additional inputs to the VLM; (2) our CLIP attack attacks a set of CLIP models jointly, which can transfer to proprietary VLMs. To evaluate the attacks, we curated VisualWebArena-Adv, a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena, an environment for web-based multimodal agent tasks. Within an L-infinity norm of $16/256$ on a single image, the captioner attack can make a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute the adversarial goals with a 75% success rate. When we remove the captioner or use GPT-4V to generate its own captions, the CLIP attack can achieve success rates of 21% and 43%, respectively. Experiments on agents based on other VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5, Claude-3, and GPT-4o, show interesting differences in their robustness. Further analysis reveals several key factors contributing to the attack's success, and we also discuss the implications for defenses as well.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berthy T. Feng, Ricardo Baptista, Katherine L. Bouman</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinuk Kim, Marwa El Halabi, Mingi Ji, Hyun Oh Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works show that reducing the number of layers in a convolutional neural network can enhance efficiency while maintaining the performance of the network. Existing depth compression methods remove redundant non-linear activation functions and merge the consecutive convolution layers into a single layer. However, these methods suffer from a critical drawback; the kernel size of the merged layers becomes larger, significantly undermining the latency reduction gained from reducing the depth of the network. We show that this problem can be addressed by jointly pruning convolution layers and activation functions. To this end, we propose LayerMerge, a novel depth compression method that selects which activation layers and convolution layers to remove, to achieve a desired inference speed-up while minimizing performance loss. Since the corresponding selection problem involves an exponential search space, we formulate a novel surrogate optimization problem and efficiently solve it via dynamic programming. Empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing depth compression and layer pruning methods on various network architectures, both on image classification and generation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiran Yuan, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Tensor Completion, a method which exploits the inherent structure of tensors, has been studied extensively as an effective approach to tensor completion. Whilst such methods attained great success, none have systematically considered exploiting the numerical priors of tensor elements. Ignoring numerical priors causes loss of important information regarding the data, and therefore prevents the algorithms from reaching optimal accuracy. Despite the existence of some individual works which consider ad hoc numerical priors for specific tasks, no generalizable frameworks for incorporating numerical priors have appeared. We present the Generalized CP Decomposition Tensor Completion (GCDTC) framework, the first generalizable framework for low-rank tensor completion that takes numerical priors of the data into account. We test GCDTC by further proposing the Smooth Poisson Tensor Completion (SPTC) algorithm, an instantiation of the GCDTC framework, whose performance exceeds current state-of-the-arts by considerable margins in the task of non-negative tensor completion, exemplifying GCDTC's effectiveness. Our code is open-source.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving needs to rely on high-quality 3D object detection to ensure safe navigation in the world. Uncertainty estimation is an effective tool to provide statistically accurate predictions, while the associated detection uncertainty can be used to implement a more safe navigation protocol or include the user in the loop. In this paper, we propose a Variational Neural Network-based TANet 3D object detector to generate 3D object detections with uncertainty and introduce these detections to an uncertainty-aware AB3DMOT tracker. This is done by applying a linear transformation to the estimated uncertainty matrix, which is subsequently used as a measurement noise for the adopted Kalman filter. We implement two ways to estimate output uncertainty, i.e., internally, by computing the variance of the CNN outputs and then propagating the uncertainty through the post-processing, and externally, by associating the final predictions of different samples and computing the covariance of each predicted box. In experiments, we show that the external uncertainty estimation leads to better results, outperforming both internal uncertainty estimation and classical tracking approaches. Furthermore, we propose a method to initialize the Variational 3D object detector with a pretrained TANet model, which leads to the best performing models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition (LTML) task is a highly challenging task due to the label co-occurrence and imbalanced data distribution. In this work, we propose a unified framework for LTML, namely prompt tuning with class-specific embedding loss (LMPT), capturing the semantic feature interactions between categories by combining text and image modality data and improving the performance synchronously on both head and tail classes. Specifically, LMPT introduces the embedding loss function with class-aware soft margin and re-weighting to learn class-specific contexts with the benefit of textual descriptions (captions), which could help establish semantic relationships between classes, especially between the head and tail classes. Furthermore, taking into account the class imbalance, the distribution-balanced loss is adopted as the classification loss function to further improve the performance on the tail classes without compromising head classes. Extensive experiments are conducted on VOC-LT and COCO-LT datasets, which demonstrates that our method significantly surpasses the previous state-of-the-art methods and zero-shot CLIP in LTML.

<p>Abstract: Recently, the significant achievements have been made in skeleton-based human action recognition with the emergence of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models used for this task focus on constructing more complex higher-order connections between joint nodes to describe skeleton information, which leads to complex inference processes and high computational costs. To address the slow inference speed caused by overly complex model structures, we introduce re-parameterization and over-parameterization techniques to GCNs and propose two novel high-performance inference GCNs, namely HPI-GCN-RP and HPI-GCN-OP. After the completion of model training, model parameters are fixed. HPI-GCN-RP adopts re-parameterization technique to transform high-performance training model into fast inference model through linear transformations, which achieves a higher inference speed with competitive model performance. HPI-GCN-OP further utilizes over-parameterization technique to achieve higher performance improvement by introducing additional inference parameters, albeit with slightly decreased inference speed. The experimental results on the two skeleton-based action recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our HPI-GCN-OP achieves performance comparable to the current SOTA models, with inference speeds five times faster. Specifically, our HPI-GCN-OP achieves an accuracy of 93\% on the cross-subject split of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, and 90.1\% on the cross-subject benchmark of the NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset.

<p>Abstract: Gait recognition, a growing field in biological recognition technology, utilizes distinct walking patterns for accurate individual identification. However, existing methods lack the incorporation of temporal information. To reach the full potential of gait recognition, we advocate for the consideration of temporal features at varying granularities and spans. This paper introduces a novel framework, GaitGS, which aggregates temporal features simultaneously in both granularity and span dimensions. Specifically, the Multi-Granularity Feature Extractor (MGFE) is designed to capture micro-motion and macro-motion information at fine and coarse levels respectively, while the Multi-Span Feature Extractor (MSFE) generates local and global temporal representations. Through extensive experiments on two datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving Rank-1 accuracy of 98.2%, 96.5%, and 89.7% on CASIA-B under different conditions, and 97.6% on OU-MVLP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Rong, Hao Chen, Tianxiao Chen, Linlin Ou, Xinyi Yu, Yifan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt learning has become a popular approach for adapting large vision-language models, such as CLIP, to downstream tasks. Typically, prompt learning relies on a fixed prompt token or an input-conditional token to fit a small amount of data under full supervision. While this paradigm can generalize to a certain range of unseen classes, it may struggle when domain gap increases, such as in fine-grained classification and satellite image segmentation. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-enhanced Prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache the knowledge representations from downstream tasks. we first construct a retrieval database from training examples, or from external examples when available. We then integrate this retrieval-enhanced mechanism into various stages of a simple prompt learning baseline. By referencing similar samples in the training set, the enhanced model is better able to adapt to new tasks with few samples. Our extensive experiments over 15 vision datasets, including 11 downstream tasks with few-shot setting and 4 domain generalization benchmarks, demonstrate that RePrompt achieves considerably improved performance. Our proposed approach provides a promising solution to the challenges faced by prompt learning when domain gap increases. The code and models will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenlin Xu, Yi Zhu, Tiffany Deng, Abhay Mittal, Yanbei Chen, Manchen Wang, Paolo Favaro, Joseph Tighe, Davide Modolo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents novel benchmarks for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in zero-shot recognition, focusing on granularity and specificity. Although VLMs excel in tasks like image captioning, they face challenges in open-world settings. Our benchmarks test VLMs' consistency in understanding concepts across semantic granularity levels and their response to varying text specificity. Findings show that VLMs favor moderately fine-grained concepts and struggle with specificity, often misjudging texts that differ from their training data. Extensive evaluations reveal limitations in current VLMs, particularly in distinguishing between correct and subtly incorrect descriptions. While fine-tuning offers some improvements, it doesn't fully address these issues, highlighting the need for VLMs with enhanced generalization capabilities for real-world applications. This study provides insights into VLM limitations and suggests directions for developing more robust models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zinuo Li, Xuhang Chen, Chi-Man Pun, Xiaodong Cun</p>
<p>Abstract: Shadows often occur when we capture the documents with casual equipment, which influences the visual quality and readability of the digital copies. Different from the algorithms for natural shadow removal, the algorithms in document shadow removal need to preserve the details of fonts and figures in high-resolution input. Previous works ignore this problem and remove the shadows via approximate attention and small datasets, which might not work in real-world situations. We handle high-resolution document shadow removal directly via a larger-scale real-world dataset and a carefully designed frequency-aware network. As for the dataset, we acquire over 7k couples of high-resolution (2462 x 3699) images of real-world document pairs with various samples under different lighting circumstances, which is 10 times larger than existing datasets. As for the design of the network, we decouple the high-resolution images in the frequency domain, where the low-frequency details and high-frequency boundaries can be effectively learned via the carefully designed network structure. Powered by our network and dataset, the proposed method clearly shows a better performance than previous methods in terms of visual quality and numerical results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleonora Andreis, Paolo Panicucci, Francesco Topputo</p>
<p>Abstract: The surge of deep-space probes makes it unsustainable to navigate them with standard radiometric tracking. Self-driving interplanetary satellites represent a solution to this problem. In this work, a full vision-based navigation algorithm is built by combining an orbit determination method with an image processing pipeline suitable for interplanetary transfers of autonomous platforms. To increase the computational efficiency of the algorithm, a non-dimensional extended Kalman filter is selected as state estimator, fed by the positions of the planets extracted from deep-space images. An enhancement of the estimation accuracy is performed by applying an optimal strategy to select the best pair of planets to track. Moreover, a novel analytical measurement model for deep-space navigation is developed providing a first-order approximation of the light-aberration and light-time effects. Algorithm performance is tested on a high-fidelity, Earth--Mars interplanetary transfer, showing the algorithm applicability for deep-space navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixun Huang, Keling Yao, Seth Z. Zhao, Chuanyu Pan, Chenfeng Xu, Kathy Zhuang, Tianjian Xu, Weiyu Feng, Allen Y. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust 6DoF pose estimation with mobile devices is the foundation for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and digital twin localization. In this paper, we extensively investigate the robustness of existing RGBD-based 6DoF pose estimation methods against varying levels of depth sensor noise. We highlight that existing 6DoF pose estimation methods suffer significant performance discrepancies due to depth measurement inaccuracies. In response to the robustness issue, we present a simple and effective transformer-based 6DoF pose estimation approach called DTTDNet, featuring a novel geometric feature filtering module and a Chamfer distance loss for training. Moreover, we advance the field of robust 6DoF pose estimation and introduce a new dataset -- Digital Twin Tracking Dataset Mobile (DTTD-Mobile), tailored for digital twin object tracking with noisy depth data from the mobile RGBD sensor suite of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTTDNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at least 4.32, up to 60.74 points in ADD metrics on the DTTD-Mobile. More importantly, our approach exhibits superior robustness to varying levels of measurement noise, setting a new benchmark for the robustness to noise measurements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Aigerman, Thibault Groueix</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a fully-automatic, text-guided generative method for producing perfectly-repeating, periodic, tile-able 2D imagery, such as the one seen on floors, mosaics, ceramics, and the work of M.C. Escher. In contrast to square texture images that are seamless when tiled, our method generates non-square tilings which comprise solely of repeating copies of the same object. It achieves this by optimizing both geometry and texture of a 2D mesh, yielding a non-square tile in the shape and appearance of the desired object, with close to no additional background details, that can tile the plane without gaps nor overlaps. We enable optimization of the tile's shape by an unconstrained, differentiable parameterization of the space of all valid tileable meshes for given boundary conditions stemming from a symmetry group. Namely, we construct a differentiable family of linear systems derived from a 2D mesh-mapping technique - Orbifold Tutte Embedding - by considering the mesh's Laplacian matrix as differentiable parameters. We prove that the solution space of these linear systems is exactly all possible valid tiling configurations, thereby providing an end-to-end differentiable representation for the entire space of valid tiles. We render the textured mesh via a differentiable renderer, and leverage a pre-trained image diffusion model to induce a loss on the resulting image, updating the mesh's parameters so as to make its appearance match the text prompt. We show our method is able to produce plausible, appealing results, with non-trivial tiles, for a variety of different periodic tiling patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingqian Wu, Rongtao Xu, Zach Wood-Doughty, Changwei Wang, Shibiao Xu, Edmund Y. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Local feature detection and description play an important role in many computer vision tasks, which are designed to detect and describe keypoints in "any scene" and "any downstream task". Data-driven local feature learning methods need to rely on pixel-level correspondence for training, which is challenging to acquire at scale, thus hindering further improvements in performance. In this paper, we propose SAMFeat to introduce SAM (segment anything model), a fundamental model trained on 11 million images, as a teacher to guide local feature learning and thus inspire higher performance on limited datasets. To do so, first, we construct an auxiliary task of Attention-weighted Semantic Relation Distillation (ASRD), which distillates feature relations with category-agnostic semantic information learned by the SAM encoder into a local feature learning network, to improve local feature description using semantic discrimination. Second, we develop a technique called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning Based on Semantic Grouping (WSC), which utilizes semantic groupings derived from SAM as weakly supervised signals, to optimize the metric space of local descriptors. Third, we design an Edge Attention Guidance (EAG) to further improve the accuracy of local feature detection and description by prompting the network to pay more attention to the edge region guided by SAM. SAMFeat's performance on various tasks such as image matching on HPatches, and long-term visual localization on Aachen Day-Night showcases its superiority over previous local features.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13876">Multimodal Transformer Using Cross-Channel attention for Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bissmella Bahaduri, Zuheng Ming, Fangchen Feng, Anissa Mokraou</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection in Remote Sensing Images (RSI) is a critical task for numerous applications in Earth Observation (EO). Differing from object detection in natural images, object detection in remote sensing images faces challenges of scarcity of annotated data and the presence of small objects represented by only a few pixels. Multi-modal fusion has been determined to enhance the accuracy by fusing data from multiple modalities such as RGB, infrared (IR), lidar, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). To this end, the fusion of representations at the mid or late stage, produced by parallel subnetworks, is dominant, with the disadvantages of increasing computational complexity in the order of the number of modalities and the creation of additional engineering obstacles. Using the cross-attention mechanism, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion strategy for mapping relationships between different channels at the early stage, enabling the construction of a coherent input by aligning the different modalities. By addressing fusion in the early stage, as opposed to mid or late-stage methods, our method achieves competitive and even superior performance compared to existing techniques. Additionally, we enhance the SWIN transformer by integrating convolution layers into the feed-forward of non-shifting blocks. This augmentation strengthens the model's capacity to merge separated windows through local attention, thereby improving small object detection. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal fusion module and the architecture, demonstrating their applicability to object detection in multimodal aerial imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuehai Chen, Qingzhong Wang, Jing Yang, Badong Chen, Haoyi Xiong, Shaoyi Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Crowd counting models in highly congested areas confront two main challenges: weak localization ability and difficulty in differentiating between foreground and background, leading to inaccurate estimations. The reason is that objects in highly congested areas are normally small and high level features extracted by convolutional neural networks are less discriminative to represent small objects. To address these problems, we propose a learning discriminative features framework for crowd counting, which is composed of a masked feature prediction module (MPM) and a supervised pixel-level contrastive learning module (CLM). The MPM randomly masks feature vectors in the feature map and then reconstructs them, allowing the model to learn about what is present in the masked regions and improving the model's ability to localize objects in high density regions. The CLM pulls targets close to each other and pushes them far away from background in the feature space, enabling the model to discriminate foreground objects from background. Additionally, the proposed modules can be beneficial in various computer vision tasks, such as crowd counting and object detection, where dense scenes or cluttered environments pose challenges to accurate localization. The proposed two modules are plug-and-play, incorporating the proposed modules into existing models can potentially boost their performance in these scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Liu, Yichen Zhu, Jindong Gu, Yunshi Lan, Chao Yang, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The security concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains understudied. In this paper, we observe that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can be easily compromised by query-relevant images, as if the text query itself were malicious. To address this, we introduce MM-SafetyBench, a comprehensive framework designed for conducting safety-critical evaluations of MLLMs against such image-based manipulations. We have compiled a dataset comprising 13 scenarios, resulting in a total of 5,040 text-image pairs. Our analysis across 12 state-of-the-art models reveals that MLLMs are susceptible to breaches instigated by our approach, even when the equipped LLMs have been safety-aligned. In response, we propose a straightforward yet effective prompting strategy to enhance the resilience of MLLMs against these types of attacks. Our work underscores the need for a concerted effort to strengthen and enhance the safety measures of open-source MLLMs against potential malicious exploits.

<p>Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence offers a novel and transformative approach to creating digital art across diverse styles and modalities like images, videos and 3D data, unleashing the power of creativity and revolutionizing the way that we perceive and interact with visual content. This paper reports on recent advances in stylized 3D asset creation and manipulation with the expressive power of neural networks. We establish a taxonomy for neural stylization, considering crucial design choices such as scene representation, guidance data, optimization strategies, and output styles. Building on such taxonomy, our survey first revisits the background of neural stylization on 2D images, and then presents in-depth discussions on recent neural stylization methods for 3D data, accompanied by a mini-benchmark evaluating selected neural field stylization methods. Based on the insights gained from the survey, we highlight the practical significance, open challenges, future research, and potential impacts of neural stylization, which facilitates researchers and practitioners to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of 3D content creation using modern artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maomao Li, Yu Li, Tianyu Yang, Yunfei Liu, Dongxu Yue, Zhihui Lin, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a video inversion approach for zero-shot video editing, which models the input video with low-rank representation during the inversion process. The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of the autonomous driving industry has led to a significant accumulation of autonomous driving data. Consequently, there comes a growing demand for retrieving data to provide specialized optimization. However, directly applying previous image retrieval methods faces several challenges, such as the lack of global feature representation and inadequate text retrieval ability for complex driving scenes. To address these issues, firstly, we propose the BEV-TSR framework which leverages descriptive text as an input to retrieve corresponding scenes in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. Then to facilitate complex scene retrieval with extensive text descriptions, we employ a large language model (LLM) to extract the semantic features of the text inputs and incorporate knowledge graph embeddings to enhance the semantic richness of the language embedding. To achieve feature alignment between the BEV feature and language embedding, we propose Shared Cross-modal Embedding with a set of shared learnable embeddings to bridge the gap between these two modalities, and employ a caption generation task to further enhance the alignment. Furthermore, there lack of well-formed retrieval datasets for effective evaluation. To this end, we establish a multi-level retrieval dataset, nuScenes-Retrieval, based on the widely adopted nuScenes dataset. Experimental results on the multi-level nuScenes-Retrieval show that BEV-TSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 85.78% and 87.66% top-1 accuracy on scene-to-text and text-to-scene retrieval respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lang Nie, Chunyu Lin, Kang Liao, Shuaicheng Liu, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Thin-plate spline (TPS) is a principal warp that allows for representing elastic, nonlinear transformation with control point motions. With the increase of control points, the warp becomes increasingly flexible but usually encounters a bottleneck caused by undesired issues, e.g., content distortion. In this paper, we explore generic applications of TPS in single-image-based warping tasks, such as rotation correction, rectangling, and portrait correction. To break this bottleneck, we propose the coupled thin-plate spline model (CoupledTPS), which iteratively couples multiple TPS with limited control points into a more flexible and powerful transformation. Concretely, we first design an iterative search to predict new control points according to the current latent condition. Then, we present the warping flow as a bridge for the coupling of different TPS transformations, effectively eliminating interpolation errors caused by multiple warps. Besides, in light of the laborious annotation cost, we develop a semi-supervised learning scheme to improve warping quality by exploiting unlabeled data. It is formulated through dual transformation between the searched control points of unlabeled data and its graphic augmentation, yielding an implicit correction consistency constraint. Finally, we collect massive unlabeled data to exhibit the benefit of our semi-supervised scheme in rotation correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and universality of CoupledTPS over the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions for rotation correction and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Wan, Wanhua Li, Jason Ken Adhinarta, Atmadeep Banerjee, Evelina Sjostedt, Jingpeng Wu, Jeff Lichtman, Hanspeter Pfister, Donglai Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: While imaging techniques at macro and mesoscales have garnered substantial attention and resources, microscale Volume Electron Microscopy (vEM) imaging, capable of revealing intricate vascular details, has lacked the necessary benchmarking infrastructure. In this paper, we address a significant gap in this field of neuroimaging by introducing the first-in-class public benchmark, BvEM, designed specifically for cortical blood vessel segmentation in vEM images. Our BvEM benchmark is based on vEM image volumes from three mammals: adult mouse, macaque, and human. We standardized the resolution, addressed imaging variations, and meticulously annotated blood vessels through semi-automatic, manual, and quality control processes, ensuring high-quality 3D segmentation. Furthermore, we developed a zero-shot cortical blood vessel segmentation method named TriSAM, which leverages the powerful segmentation model SAM for 3D segmentation. To extend SAM from 2D to 3D volume segmentation, TriSAM employs a multi-seed tracking framework, leveraging the reliability of certain image planes for tracking while using others to identify potential turning points. This approach effectively achieves long-term 3D blood vessel segmentation without model training or fine-tuning. Experimental results show that TriSAM achieved superior performances on the BvEM benchmark across three species.

<p>Abstract: This study tackles key obstacles in adopting surgical navigation in orthopedic surgeries, including time, cost, radiation, and workflow integration challenges. Recently, our work X23D showed an approach for generating 3D anatomical models of the spine from only a few intraoperative fluoroscopic images. This negates the need for conventional registration-based surgical navigation by creating a direct intraoperative 3D reconstruction of the anatomy. Despite these strides, the practical application of X23D has been limited by a domain gap between synthetic training data and real intraoperative images.
  In response, we devised a novel data collection protocol for a paired dataset consisting of synthetic and real fluoroscopic images from the same perspectives. Utilizing this dataset, we refined our deep learning model via transfer learning, effectively bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real X-ray data. A novel style transfer mechanism also allows us to convert real X-rays to mirror the synthetic domain, enabling our in-silico-trained X23D model to achieve high accuracy in real-world settings.
  Our results demonstrated that the refined model can rapidly generate accurate 3D reconstructions of the entire lumbar spine from as few as three intraoperative fluoroscopic shots. It achieved an 84% F1 score, matching the accuracy of our previous synthetic data-based research. Additionally, with a computational time of only 81.1 ms, our approach provides real-time capabilities essential for surgery integration.
  Through examining ideal imaging setups and view angle dependencies, we've further confirmed our system's practicality and dependability in clinical settings. Our research marks a significant step forward in intraoperative 3D reconstruction, offering enhancements to surgical planning, navigation, and robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saqib Qamar, Abu Imran Baba, St\'ephane Verger, Magnus Andersson</p>
<p>Abstract: Wood comprises different cell types, such as fibers, tracheids and vessels, defining its properties. Studying cells' shape, size, and arrangement in microscopy images is crucial for understanding wood characteristics. Typically, this involves macerating (soaking) samples in a solution to separate cells, then spreading them on slides for imaging with a microscope that covers a wide area, capturing thousands of cells. However, these cells often cluster and overlap in images, making the segmentation difficult and time-consuming using standard image-processing methods. In this work, we developed an automatic deep learning segmentation approach that utilizes the one-stage YOLOv8 model for fast and accurate segmentation and characterization of macerated fiber and vessel form aspen trees in microscopy images. The model can analyze 32,640 x 25,920 pixels images and demonstrate effective cell detection and segmentation, achieving a mAP_{0.5-0.95} of 78 %. To assess the model's robustness, we examined fibers from a genetically modified tree line known for longer fibers. The outcomes were comparable to previous manual measurements. Additionally, we created a user-friendly web application for image analysis and provided the code for use on Google Colab. By leveraging YOLOv8's advances, this work provides a deep learning solution to enable efficient quantification and analysis of wood cells suitable for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Fein-Ashley, Tian Ye, Sachini Wickramasinghe, Bingyi Zhang, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classifiers often rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for their tasks, which are inherently more heavyweight than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which can be problematic in real-time applications. Additionally, many image classification models work on both RGB and grayscale datasets. Classifiers that operate solely on grayscale images are much less common. Grayscale image classification has diverse applications, including but not limited to medical image classification and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). Thus, we present a novel grayscale (single channel) image classification approach using a vectorized view of images. We exploit the lightweightness of MLPs by viewing images as a vector and reducing our problem setting to the grayscale image classification setting. We find that using a single graph convolutional layer batch-wise increases accuracy and reduces variance in the performance of our model. Moreover, we develop a customized accelerator on FPGA for the proposed model with several optimizations to improve its performance. Our experimental results on benchmark grayscale image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving vastly lower latency (up to 16$\times$ less) and competitive or leading performance compared to other state-of-the-art image classification models on various domain-specific grayscale image classification datasets.</p>

Most existing methods learn the mapping function between low/normal-light images by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on sRGB and HSV color space. Nevertheless, enhancement involves amplifying image signals, and applying these color spaces to low-light images with a low signal-to-noise ratio can introduce sensitivity and instability into the enhancement process. Consequently, this results in the presence of color artifacts and brightness artifacts in the enhanced images. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel trainable color space, named Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI). It not only decouples brightness and color from RGB channels to mitigate the instability during enhancement but also adapts to low-light images in different illumination ranges due to the trainable parameters. Further, we design a novel Color and Intensity Decoupling Network (CIDNet) with two branches dedicated to processing the decoupled image brightness and color in the HVI space. Within CIDNet, we introduce the Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA) module to facilitate interaction between image structure and content information in both branches, while also suppressing noise in low-light images. Finally, we conducted 22 quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that the proposed CIDNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengrui Guo, Jiabo Ma, Yingxue Xu, Yihui Wang, Liansheng Wang, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathology serves as the gold standard in cancer diagnosis, with clinical reports being vital in interpreting and understanding this process, guiding cancer treatment and patient care. The automation of histopathology report generation with deep learning stands to significantly enhance clinical efficiency and lessen the labor-intensive, time-consuming burden on pathologists in report writing. In pursuit of this advancement, we introduce HistGen, a multiple instance learning-empowered framework for histopathology report generation together with the first benchmark dataset for evaluation. Inspired by diagnostic and report-writing workflows, HistGen features two delicately designed modules, aiming to boost report generation by aligning whole slide images (WSIs) and diagnostic reports from local and global granularity. To achieve this, a local-global hierarchical encoder is developed for efficient visual feature aggregation from a region-to-slide perspective. Meanwhile, a cross-modal context module is proposed to explicitly facilitate alignment and interaction between distinct modalities, effectively bridging the gap between the extensive visual sequences of WSIs and corresponding highly summarized reports. Experimental results on WSI report generation show the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by a large margin. Moreover, the results of fine-tuning our model on cancer subtyping and survival analysis tasks further demonstrate superior performance compared to SOTA methods, showcasing strong transfer learning capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Xiang Li, Yimain Dai, Qibin Hou, Li Liu, Yongxiang Liu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing images pose distinct challenges for downstream tasks due to their inherent complexity. While a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our comprehensive analysis further validated the significance of the identified priors and the effectiveness of LSKNet. The code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/LSKNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Chen, Yuxuan Liu, Dehu Li, Xiang An, Weimo Deng, Ziyong Feng, Yongle Zhao, Yin Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), renowned for their advanced instruction-following and reasoning capabilities, has significantly propelled the field of visual reasoning. However, due to limitations in their image tokenization processes, most MLLMs struggle to capture fine details of text and objects in images, especially in high-resolution samples. To overcome this limitation, we introduce P2G, a novel framework for plug-and-play grounding in MLLMs. P2G utilizes the tool-usage potential of MLLMs to employ expert agents for on-the-fly grounding of reasoning into critical visual and textual elements in images, thereby enabling deliberate reasoning through multimodal prompting. Additionally, we develop P2GB, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' proficiency in understanding inter-object relationships and textual content in challenging high-resolution images. Extensive experiments on visual reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of P2G, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4V on P2GB with a 7B backbone. Our work underscores the potential of grounding reasoning with external agents in MLLMs, presenting a promising alternative to mere model scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiu Lin, Deepak Pathak, Baiqi Li, Jiayao Li, Xide Xia, Graham Neubig, Pengchuan Zhang, Deva Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative AI, comprehensive evaluation remains challenging because of the lack of effective metrics and standardized benchmarks. For instance, the widely-used CLIPScore measures the alignment between a (generated) image and text prompt, but it fails to produce reliable scores for complex prompts involving compositions of objects, attributes, and relations. One reason is that text encoders of CLIP can notoriously act as a "bag of words", conflating prompts such as "the horse is eating the grass" with "the grass is eating the horse". To address this, we introduce the VQAScore, which uses a visual-question-answering (VQA) model to produce an alignment score by computing the probability of a "Yes" answer to a simple "Does this figure show '{text}'?" question. Though simpler than prior art, VQAScore computed with off-the-shelf models produces state-of-the-art results across many (8) image-text alignment benchmarks. We also compute VQAScore with an in-house model that follows best practices in the literature. For example, we use a bidirectional image-question encoder that allows image embeddings to depend on the question being asked (and vice versa). Our in-house model, CLIP-FlanT5, outperforms even the strongest baselines that make use of the proprietary GPT-4V. Interestingly, although we train with only images, VQAScore can also align text with video and 3D models. VQAScore allows researchers to benchmark text-to-visual generation using complex texts that capture the compositional structure of real-world prompts. We introduce GenAI-Bench, a more challenging benchmark with 1,600 compositional text prompts that require parsing scenes, objects, attributes, relationships, and high-order reasoning like comparison and logic. GenAI-Bench also offers over 15,000 human ratings for leading image and video generation models such as Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, and Gen2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Chen, Xinghang Gao, Fei Chao, Xiang Chang, Chih Min Lin, Xingen Gao, Shaopeng Lin, Hongyi Zhang, Juqiang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of crowd counting research, many recent deep learning based methods have demonstrated robust capabilities for accurately estimating crowd sizes. However, the enhancement in their performance often arises from an increase in the complexity of the model structure. This paper discusses how to construct high-performance crowd counting models using only simple structures. We proposes the Fuss-Free Network (FFNet) that is characterized by its simple and efficieny structure, consisting of only a backbone network and a multi-scale feature fusion structure. The multi-scale feature fusion structure is a simple structure consisting of three branches, each only equipped with a focus transition module, and combines the features from these branches through the concatenation operation. Our proposed crowd counting model is trained and evaluated on four widely used public datasets, and it achieves accuracy that is comparable to that of existing complex models. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation by replacing the existing backbones of various models such as FFNet and CCTrans with different networks, including MobileNet-v3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Swin-Transformer-Small. The experimental results further indicate that excellent crowd counting performance can be achieved with the simplied structure proposed by us.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Feng, Yongbo He, Yubo Wang, Yan Yang, Wen Li, Yifei Chen, Zhenzhong Kuang, Jiajun ding, Jianping Fan, Yu Jun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity as a novel explicit 3D representation. This approach relies on the representation power of Gaussian primitives to provide a high-quality rendering. However, primitives optimized at low resolution inevitably exhibit sparsity and texture deficiency, posing a challenge for achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS). To address this problem, we propose Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting (SRGS) to perform the optimization in a high-resolution (HR) space. The sub-pixel constraint is introduced for the increased viewpoints in HR space, exploiting the sub-pixel cross-view information of the multiple low-resolution (LR) views. The gradient accumulated from more viewpoints will facilitate the densification of primitives. Furthermore, a pre-trained 2D super-resolution model is integrated with the sub-pixel constraint, enabling these dense primitives to learn faithful texture features. In general, our method focuses on densification and texture learning to effectively enhance the representation ability of primitives. Experimentally, our method achieves high rendering quality on HRNVS only with LR inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets such as Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples. Related codes will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Barthel, Arian Beckmann, Wieland Morgenstern, Anna Hilsmann, Peter Eisert</p>
<p>Abstract: NeRF-based 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like EG3D or GIRAFFE have shown very high rendering quality under large representational variety. However, rendering with Neural Radiance Fields poses challenges for 3D applications: First, the significant computational demands of NeRF rendering preclude its use on low-power devices, such as mobiles and VR/AR headsets. Second, implicit representations based on neural networks are difficult to incorporate into explicit 3D scenes, such as VR environments or video games. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes these limitations by providing an explicit 3D representation that can be rendered efficiently at high frame rates. In this work, we present a novel approach that combines the high rendering quality of NeRF-based 3D-aware GANs with the flexibility and computational advantages of 3DGS. By training a decoder that maps implicit NeRF representations to explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting attributes, we can integrate the representational diversity and quality of 3D GANs into the ecosystem of 3D Gaussian Splatting for the first time. Additionally, our approach allows for a high resolution GAN inversion and real-time GAN editing with 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. Project page: florian-barthel.github.io/gaussian_decoder</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ross Greer, Bj{\o}rk Antoniussen, Andreas M{\o}gelmose, Mohan Trivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection is crucial for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, data-driven approaches face challenges when encountering minority or novel objects in the 3D driving scene. In this paper, we propose VisLED, a language-driven active learning framework for diverse open-set 3D Object Detection. Our method leverages active learning techniques to query diverse and informative data samples from an unlabeled pool, enhancing the model's ability to detect underrepresented or novel objects. Specifically, we introduce the Vision-Language Embedding Diversity Querying (VisLED-Querying) algorithm, which operates in both open-world exploring and closed-world mining settings. In open-world exploring, VisLED-Querying selects data points most novel relative to existing data, while in closed-world mining, it mines novel instances of known classes. We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate its efficiency compared to random sampling and entropy-querying methods. Our results show that VisLED-Querying consistently outperforms random sampling and offers competitive performance compared to entropy-querying despite the latter's model-optimality, highlighting the potential of VisLED for improving object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie, Mohammad-Shahram Moin, Shohreh Kasaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in accurately estimating scene flow using point clouds, which is vital for many applications like video analysis, action recognition, and navigation. The robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants shows a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengqun Zhao, Yu Cao, Shaogang Gong, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Current facial expression recognition (FER) models are often designed in a supervised learning manner and thus are constrained by the lack of large-scale facial expression images with high-quality annotations. Consequently, these models often fail to generalize well, performing poorly on unseen images in inference. Vision-language-based zero-shot models demonstrate a promising potential for addressing such challenges. However, these models lack task-specific knowledge and therefore are not optimized for the nuances of recognizing facial expressions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel method, Exp-CLIP, to enhance zero-shot FER by transferring the task knowledge from large language models (LLMs). Specifically, based on the pre-trained vision-language encoders, we incorporate a projection head designed to map the initial joint vision-language space into a space that captures representations of facial actions. To train this projection head for subsequent zero-shot predictions, we propose to align the projected visual representations with task-specific semantic meanings derived from the LLM encoder, and the text instruction-based strategy is employed to customize the LLM knowledge. Given unlabelled facial data and efficient training of the projection head, Exp-CLIP achieves superior zero-shot results to the CLIP models and several other large vision-language models (LVLMs) on seven in-the-wild FER datasets.</p>

Although hundreds of UIE algorithms have been proposed, a comprehensive and systematic review is still lacking. To promote future research, we summarize the UIE task from multiple perspectives. First, the physical models, data construction processes, evaluation metrics, and loss functions are introduced. Second, according to the contributions brought by different literatures, recent proposed algorithms are discussed and classified from six perspectives, namely network architecture, learning strategy, learning stage, assistance task, domain perspective and disentanglement fusion, respectively. Third, considering the inconsistencies in experimental settings in different literatures, a comprehensive and fair comparison does not yet exist. To this end, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple benchmark datasets. Finally, issues worthy of further research in the UIE task are raised.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shurong Yang, Huadong Li, Juhao Wu, Minhao Jing, Linze Li, Renhe Ji, Jiajun Liang, Haoqiang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite raw driving videos contain richer information on facial expressions than intermediate representations such as landmarks in the field of portrait animation, they are seldom the subject of research. This is due to two challenges inherent in portrait animation driven with raw videos: 1) significant identity leakage; 2) Irrelevant background and facial details such as wrinkles degrade performance. To harnesses the power of the raw videos for vivid portrait animation, we proposed a pioneering conditional diffusion model named as MegActor. First, we introduced a synthetic data generation framework for creating videos with consistent motion and expressions but inconsistent IDs to mitigate the issue of ID leakage. Second, we segmented the foreground and background of the reference image and employed CLIP to encode the background details. This encoded information is then integrated into the network via a text embedding module, thereby ensuring the stability of the background. Finally, we further style transfer the appearance of the reference image to the driving video to eliminate the influence of facial details in the driving videos. Our final model was trained solely on public datasets, achieving results comparable to commercial models. We hope this will help the open-source community.The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/MegFaceAnimate.</p>

<p>Abstract: The polygon mesh representation of 3D data exhibits great flexibility, fast rendering speed, and storage efficiency, which is widely preferred in various applications. However, given its unstructured graph representation, the direct generation of high-fidelity 3D meshes is challenging. Fortunately, with a pre-defined ordering strategy, 3D meshes can be represented as sequences, and the generation process can be seamlessly treated as an auto-regressive problem. In this paper, we validate the Neural Coordinate Field (NeurCF), an explicit coordinate representation with implicit neural embeddings, is a simple-yet-effective representation for large-scale sequential mesh modeling. After that, we present MeshXL, a family of generative pre-trained auto-regressive models, which addresses the process of 3D mesh generation with modern large language model approaches. Extensive experiments show that MeshXL is able to generate high-quality 3D meshes, and can also serve as foundation models for various down-stream applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Face Super-Resolution (FSR) aims to recover high-resolution (HR) face images from low-resolution (LR) ones. Despite the progress made by convolutional neural networks in FSR, the results of existing approaches are not ideal due to their low reconstruction efficiency and insufficient utilization of prior information. Considering that faces are highly structured objects, effectively leveraging facial priors to improve FSR results is a worthwhile endeavor. This paper proposes a novel network architecture called W-Net to address this challenge. W-Net leverages meticulously designed Parsing Block to fully exploit the resolution potential of LR image. We use this parsing map as an attention prior, effectively integrating information from both the parsing map and LR images. Simultaneously, we perform multiple fusions in various dimensions through the W-shaped network structure combined with the LPF(LR-Parsing Map Fusion Module). Additionally, we utilize a facial parsing graph as a mask, assigning different weights and loss functions to key facial areas to balance the performance of our reconstructed facial images between perceptual quality and pixel accuracy. We conducted extensive comparative experiments, not only limited to conventional facial super-resolution metrics but also extending to downstream tasks such as facial recognition and facial keypoint detection. The experiments demonstrate that W-Net exhibits outstanding performance in quantitative metrics, visual quality, and downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: By combining differentiable rendering with explicit point-based scene representations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated breakthrough 3D reconstruction capabilities. However, to date 3DGS has had limited impact on robotics, where high-speed egomotion is pervasive: Egomotion introduces motion blur and leads to artifacts in existing frame-based 3DGS reconstruction methods. To address this challenge, we introduce Event3DGS, an {\em event-based} 3DGS framework. By exploiting the exceptional temporal resolution of event cameras, Event3GDS can reconstruct high-fidelity 3D structure and appearance under high-speed egomotion. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Event3DGS compared with existing event-based dense 3D scene reconstruction frameworks; Event3DGS substantially improves reconstruction quality (+3dB) while reducing computational costs by 95\%. Our framework also allows one to incorporate a few motion-blurred frame-based measurements into the reconstruction process to further improve appearance fidelity without loss of structural accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitao Xu, Tong Zhang, Sabine S\"usstrunk</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image classification tasks, particularly when equipped with local information via region attention or convolutions. While such architectures improve the feature aggregation from different granularities, they often fail to contribute to the robustness of the networks. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) enables the modeling of global cell representations through local interactions, with its training strategies and architecture design conferring strong generalization ability and robustness against noisy inputs. In this paper, we propose Adaptor Neural Cellular Automata (AdaNCA) for Vision Transformer that uses NCA as plug-in-play adaptors between ViT layers, enhancing ViT's performance and robustness against adversarial samples as well as out-of-distribution inputs. To overcome the large computational overhead of standard NCAs, we propose Dynamic Interaction for more efficient interaction learning. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for identifying the most effective insertion points for AdaNCA based on our analysis of AdaNCA placement and robustness improvement. With less than a 3% increase in parameters, AdaNCA contributes to more than 10% absolute improvement in accuracy under adversarial attacks on the ImageNet1K benchmark. Moreover, we demonstrate with extensive evaluations across 8 robustness benchmarks and 4 ViT architectures that AdaNCA, as a plug-in-play module, consistently improves the robustness of ViTs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web-crawled image-text pairs are inherently noisy. Prior studies demonstrate that semantically aligning and enriching textual descriptions of these pairs can significantly enhance model training across various vision-language tasks, particularly text-to-image generation. However, large-scale investigations in this area remain predominantly closed-source. Our paper aims to bridge this community effort, leveraging the powerful and \textit{open-sourced} LLaMA-3, a GPT-4 level LLM. Our recaptioning pipeline is simple: first, we fine-tune a LLaMA-3-8B powered LLaVA-1.5 and then employ it to recaption 1.3 billion images from the DataComp-1B dataset. Our empirical results confirm that this enhanced dataset, Recap-DataComp-1B, offers substantial benefits in training advanced vision-language models. For discriminative models like CLIP, we observe enhanced zero-shot performance in cross-modal retrieval tasks. For generative models like text-to-image Diffusion Transformers, the generated images exhibit a significant improvement in alignment with users' text instructions, especially in following complex queries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Khajuria, Braian Olmiro Dias, Jaan Aru</p>
<p>Abstract: Forming and using symbol-like structured representations for reasoning has been considered essential for generalising over novel inputs. The primary tool that allows generalisation outside training data distribution is the ability to abstract away irrelevant information into a compact form relevant to the task. An extreme form of such abstract representations is symbols. Humans make use of symbols to bind information while abstracting away irrelevant parts to utilise the information consistently and meaningfully. This work estimates the state of such structured representations in vision encoders. Specifically, we evaluate image encoders in large vision-language pre-trained models to address the question of which desirable properties their representations lack by applying the criteria of symbolic structured reasoning described for LLMs to the image models. We test the representation space of image encoders like VIT, BLIP, CLIP, and FLAVA to characterise the distribution of the object representations in these models. In particular, we create decoding tasks using multi-object scenes from the COCO dataset, relating the token space to its input content for various objects in the scene. We use these tasks to characterise the network's token and layer-wise information modelling. Our analysis highlights that the CLS token, used for the downstream task, only focuses on a few objects necessary for the trained downstream task. Still, other individual objects are well-modelled separately by the tokens in the network originating from those objects. We further observed a widespread distribution of scene information. This demonstrates that information is far more entangled in tokens than optimal for representing objects similar to symbols. Given these symbolic properties, we show the network dynamics that cause failure modes of these models on basic downstream tasks in a multi-object scene.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enming Zhang, Ruobing Yao, Huanyong Liu, Junhui Yu, Jiale Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) technology, its general capabilities are increasingly powerful. To evaluate the various abilities of MLLMs, numerous evaluation systems have emerged. But now there is still a lack of a comprehensive method to evaluate MLLMs in the tasks related to flowcharts, which are very important in daily life and work. We propose the first comprehensive method, FlowCE, to assess MLLMs across various dimensions for tasks related to flowcharts. It encompasses evaluating MLLMs' abilities in Reasoning, Localization Recognition, Information Extraction, Logical Verification, and Summarization on flowcharts. However, we find that even the GPT4o model achieves only a score of 56.63. Among open-source models, Phi-3-Vision obtained the highest score of 49.97. We hope that FlowCE can contribute to future research on MLLMs for tasks based on flowcharts. \url{https://github.com/360AILAB-NLP/FlowCE} \end{abstract}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Meng, Yufei Zhao, Bo Zhang, Yonggui Zhu, Weimin Shi, Maxwell Wen, Zhaoxin Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Talking head synthesis, an advanced method for generating portrait videos from a still image driven by specific content, has garnered widespread attention in virtual reality, augmented reality and game production. Recently, significant breakthroughs have been made with the introduction of novel models such as the transformer and the diffusion model. Current methods can not only generate new content but also edit the generated material. This survey systematically reviews the technology, categorizing it into three pivotal domains: portrait generation, driven mechanisms, and editing techniques. We summarize milestone studies and critically analyze their innovations and shortcomings within each domain. Additionally, we organize an extensive collection of datasets and provide a thorough performance analysis of current methodologies based on various evaluation metrics, aiming to furnish a clear framework and robust data support for future research. Finally, we explore application scenarios of talking head synthesis, illustrate them with specific cases, and examine potential future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialong Wu, Mirko Meuter, Markus Schoeler, Matthias Rottmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Radar-based perception has gained increasing attention in autonomous driving, yet the inherent sparsity of radars poses challenges. Radar raw data often contains excessive noise, whereas radar point clouds retain only limited information. In this work, we holistically treat the sparse nature of radar data by introducing an adaptive subsampling method together with a tailored network architecture that exploits the sparsity patterns to discover global and local dependencies in the radar signal. Our subsampling module selects a subset of pixels from range-doppler (RD) spectra that contribute most to the downstream perception tasks. To improve the feature extraction on sparse subsampled data, we propose a new way of applying graph neural networks on radar data and design a novel two-branch backbone to capture both global and local neighbor information. An attentive fusion module is applied to combine features from both branches. Experiments on the RADIal dataset show that our SparseRadNet exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in object detection and achieves close to SOTA accuracy in freespace segmentation, meanwhile using sparse subsampled input data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guowen Zhang, Lue Fan, Chenhang He, Zhen Lei, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Serialization-based methods, which serialize the 3D voxels and group them into multiple sequences before inputting to Transformers, have demonstrated their effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, serializing 3D voxels into 1D sequences will inevitably sacrifice the voxel spatial proximity. Such an issue is hard to be addressed by enlarging the group size with existing serialization-based methods due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers with feature sizes. Inspired by the recent advances of state space models (SSMs), we present a Voxel SSM, termed as Voxel Mamba, which employs a group-free strategy to serialize the whole space of voxels into a single sequence. The linear complexity of SSMs encourages our group-free design, alleviating the loss of spatial proximity of voxels. To further enhance the spatial proximity, we propose a Dual-scale SSM Block to establish a hierarchical structure, enabling a larger receptive field in the 1D serialization curve, as well as more complete local regions in 3D space. Moreover, we implicitly apply window partition under the group-free framework by positional encoding, which further enhances spatial proximity by encoding voxel positional information. Our experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset show that Voxel Mamba not only achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, but also demonstrates significant advantages in computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eden Grad, Moshe Kimhi, Lion Halika, Chaim Baskin</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining accurate labels for instance segmentation is particularly challenging due to the complex nature of the task. Each image necessitates multiple annotations, encompassing not only the object's class but also its precise spatial boundaries. These requirements elevate the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies in both manual and automated annotation processes. By simulating different noise conditions, we provide a realistic scenario for assessing the robustness and generalization capabilities of instance segmentation models in different segmentation tasks, introducing COCO-N and Cityscapes-N. We also propose a benchmark for weakly annotation noise, dubbed COCO-WAN, which utilizes foundation models and weak annotations to simulate semi-automated annotation tools and their noisy labels. This study sheds light on the quality of segmentation masks produced by various models and challenges the efficacy of popular methods designed to address learning with label noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sompote Youwai, Achitaphon Chaiyaphat, Pawarotorn Chaipetch</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining road pavement integrity is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient transportation. Conventional methods for assessing pavement condition are often laborious and susceptible to human error. This paper proposes YOLO9tr, a novel lightweight object detection model for pavement damage detection, leveraging the advancements of deep learning. YOLO9tr is based on the YOLOv9 architecture, incorporating a partial attention block that enhances feature extraction and attention mechanisms, leading to improved detection performance in complex scenarios. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising road damage images from multiple countries, including an expanded set of damage categories beyond the standard four. This broadened classification range allows for a more accurate and realistic assessment of pavement conditions. Comparative analysis demonstrates YOLO9tr's superior precision and inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models like YOLO8, YOLO9 and YOLO10, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy. The model achieves a high frame rate of up to 136 FPS, making it suitable for real-time applications such as video surveillance and automated inspection systems. The research presents an ablation study to analyze the impact of architectural modifications and hyperparameter variations on model performance, further validating the effectiveness of the partial attention block. The results highlight YOLO9tr's potential for practical deployment in real-time pavement condition monitoring, contributing to the development of robust and efficient solutions for maintaining safe and functional road infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefeng Hu, Ke Zhang, Min Sun, Albert Chen, Cheng-Hao Kuo, Ram Nevatia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pretrained vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot image classification capabilities across diverse domains. To enhance CLIP's performance while preserving the zero-shot paradigm, various test-time prompt tuning methods have been introduced to refine class embeddings through unsupervised learning objectives during inference. However, these methods often encounter challenges in selecting appropriate learning rates to prevent collapsed training in the absence of validation data during test-time adaptation. In this study, we propose a novel backpropagation-free algorithm BaFTA for test-time adaptation of vision-language models. Instead of fine-tuning text prompts to refine class embeddings, our approach directly estimates class centroids using online clustering within a projected embedding space that aligns text and visual embeddings. We dynamically aggregate predictions from both estimated and original class embeddings, as well as from distinct augmented views, by assessing the reliability of each prediction using R\'enyi Entropy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BaFTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyu Wang, Chen Cai, Wenqian Wang, Jianjun Gao, Dan Lin, Wenyang Liu, Kim-Hui Yap</p>
<p>Abstract: Driver action recognition has significantly advanced in enhancing driver-vehicle interactions and ensuring driving safety by integrating multiple modalities, such as infrared and depth. Nevertheless, compared to RGB modality only, it is always laborious and costly to collect extensive data for all types of non-RGB modalities in car cabin environments. Therefore, previous works have suggested independently learning each non-RGB modality by fine-tuning a model pre-trained on RGB videos, but these methods are less effective in extracting informative features when faced with newly-incoming modalities due to large domain gaps. In contrast, we propose a Continual Cross-Modal Mapping Network (CM2-Net) to continually learn each newly-incoming modality with instructive prompts from the previously-learned modalities. Specifically, we have developed Accumulative Cross-modal Mapping Prompting (ACMP), to map the discriminative and informative features learned from previous modalities into the feature space of newly-incoming modalities. Then, when faced with newly-incoming modalities, these mapped features are able to provide effective prompts for which features should be extracted and prioritized. These prompts are accumulating throughout the continual learning process, thereby boosting further recognition performances. Extensive experiments conducted on the Drive&Act dataset demonstrate the performance superiority of CM2-Net on both uni- and multi-modal driver action recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Jiang, Jiawei Chen, Dingkang Yang, Mingcheng Li, Shunli Wang, Tong Wu, Ke Li, Lihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: When Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are applied to multimodal medical generative tasks, they suffer from significant model hallucination issues. This severely impairs the model's generative accuracy, making it challenging for LVLMs to be implemented in real-world medical scenarios to assist doctors in diagnosis. Enhancing the training data for downstream medical generative tasks is an effective way to address model hallucination. Moreover, the limited availability of training data in the medical field and privacy concerns greatly hinder the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that mimics human cognitive processes to construct fine-grained instruction pairs and apply the concept of chain-of-thought (CoT) from inference scenarios to training scenarios, thereby proposing a method called MedThink. Our experiments on various LVLMs demonstrate that our novel data construction method tailored for the medical domain significantly improves the model's performance in medical image report generation tasks and substantially mitigates the hallucinations. All resources of this work will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junha Hyung, Susung Hong, Sungwon Hwang, Jaeseong Lee, Jaegul Choo, Jin-Hwa Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is one of the fundamental challenges in computer vision and graphics. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique capable of real-time rendering with high-quality 3D reconstruction. This method utilizes 3D Gaussian representation and tile-based splatting techniques, bypassing the expensive neural field querying. Despite its potential, 3DGS encounters challenges, including needle-like artifacts, suboptimal geometries, and inaccurate normals, due to the Gaussians converging into anisotropic Gaussians with one dominant variance. We propose using effective rank analysis to examine the shape statistics of 3D Gaussian primitives, and identify the Gaussians indeed converge into needle-like shapes with the effective rank 1. To address this, we introduce effective rank as a regularization, which constrains the structure of the Gaussians. Our new regularization method enhances normal and geometry reconstruction while reducing needle-like artifacts. The approach can be integrated as an add-on module to other 3DGS variants, improving their quality without compromising visual fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nate Gruver, Marc Finzi, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: Equivariance guarantees that a model's predictions capture key symmetries in data. When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's representation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success of convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation equivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of vision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards equivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and training data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order to better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we introduce the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong mathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative, we study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning CNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows us to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or training method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can be linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise non-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to display more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example, transformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guihong Li, Duc Hoang, Kartikeya Bhardwaj, Ming Lin, Zhangyang Wang, Radu Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, zero-shot (or training-free) Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches have been proposed to liberate NAS from the expensive training process. The key idea behind zero-shot NAS approaches is to design proxies that can predict the accuracy of some given networks without training the network parameters. The proxies proposed so far are usually inspired by recent progress in theoretical understanding of deep learning and have shown great potential on several datasets and NAS benchmarks. This paper aims to comprehensively review and compare the state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot NAS approaches, with an emphasis on their hardware awareness. To this end, we first review the mainstream zero-shot proxies and discuss their theoretical underpinnings. We then compare these zero-shot proxies through large-scale experiments and demonstrate their effectiveness in both hardware-aware and hardware-oblivious NAS scenarios. Finally, we point out several promising ideas to design better proxies. Our source code and the list of related papers are available on https://github.com/SLDGroup/survey-zero-shot-nas.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqing Zhu, Benjamin Hou, Tejas S. Mathai, Pritam Mukherjee, Qiao Jin, Xiuying Chen, Zhizheng Wang, Ruida Cheng, Ronald M. Summers, Zhiyong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically interpreting CT scans can ease the workload of radiologists. However, this is challenging mainly due to the scarcity of adequate datasets and reference standards for evaluation. This study aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel evaluation framework, named ``GPTRadScore''. This framework assesses the capabilities of multi-modal LLMs, such as GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA-Med, and RadFM, in generating descriptions for prospectively-identified findings. By employing a decomposition technique based on GPT-4, GPTRadScore compares these generated descriptions with gold-standard report sentences, analyzing their accuracy in terms of body part, location, and type of finding. Evaluations demonstrated a high correlation with clinician assessments and highlighted its potential over traditional metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE. Furthermore, to contribute to future studies, we plan to release a benchmark dataset annotated by clinicians. Using GPTRadScore, we found that while GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision fare better, their performance revealed significant areas for improvement, primarily due to limitations in the dataset used for training these models. To demonstrate this potential, RadFM was fine-tuned and it resulted in significant accuracy improvements: location accuracy rose from 3.41\% to 12.8\%, body part accuracy from 29.12\% to 53\%, and type accuracy from 9.24\% to 30\%, thereby validating our hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongruixuan Chen, Jian Song, Chengxi Han, Junshi Xia, Naoto Yokoya</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have made impressive progress in the field of remote sensing change detection (CD). However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings: CNN are constrained by a limited receptive field that may hinder their ability to capture broader spatial contexts, while Transformers are computationally intensive, making them costly to train and deploy on large datasets. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p>

<p>Abstract: Medicine and deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) engineering represent two distinct fields each with decades of published history. With such history comes a set of terminology that has a specific way in which it is applied. However, when two distinct fields with overlapping terminology start to collaborate, miscommunication and misunderstandings can occur. This narrative review aims to give historical context for these terms, accentuate the importance of clarity when these terms are used in medical AI contexts, and offer solutions to mitigate misunderstandings by readers from either field. Through an examination of historical documents, including articles, writing guidelines, and textbooks, this review traces the divergent evolution of terms for data sets and their impact. Initially, the discordant interpretations of the word 'validation' in medical and AI contexts are explored. Then the data sets used for AI evaluation are classified, namely random splitting, cross-validation, temporal, geographic, internal, and external sets. The accurate and standardized description of these data sets is crucial for demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of AI applications in medicine. This review clarifies existing literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of these classifications and their implications in AI evaluation. This review then identifies often misunderstood terms and proposes pragmatic solutions to mitigate terminological confusion. Among these solutions are the use of standardized terminology such as 'training set,' 'validation (or tuning) set,' and 'test set,' and explicit definition of data set splitting terminologies in each medical AI research publication. This review aspires to enhance the precision of communication in medical AI, thereby fostering more effective and transparent research methodologies in this interdisciplinary field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie Dohmen, Mark Klemens, Ivo Baltruschat, Tuan Truong, Matthias Lenga</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-image translation can create large impact in medical imaging, for instance the possibility to synthetically transform images to other modalities, sequence types, higher resolutions or lower noise levels. In order to assure a high level of patient safety, these methods are mostly validated by human reader studies, which require a considerable amount of time and costs. Quantitative metrics have been used to complement such studies and to provide reproducible and objective assessment of synthetic images. Even though the SSIM and PSNR metrics are extensively used, they do not detect all types of errors in synthetic images as desired. Other metrics could provide additional useful evaluation. In this study, we give an overview and a quantitative analysis of 15 metrics for assessing the quality of synthetically generated images. We include 11 full-reference metrics (SSIM, MS-SSIM, CW-SSIM, PSNR, MSE, NMSE, MAE, LPIPS, DISTS, NMI and PCC), three non-reference metrics (BLUR, MLC, MSLC) and one downstream task segmentation metric (DICE) to detect 11 kinds of typical distortions and artifacts that occur in MR images. In addition, we analyze the influence of four prominent normalization methods (Minmax, cMinmax, Zscore and Quantile) on the different metrics and distortions. Finally, we provide adverse examples to highlight pitfalls in metric assessment and derive recommendations for effective usage of the analyzed similarity metrics for evaluation of image-to-image translation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated medical image analysis systems often require large amounts of training data with high quality labels, which are difficult and time consuming to generate. This paper introduces Radiology Object in COntext version 2 (ROCOv2), a multimodal dataset consisting of radiological images and associated medical concepts and captions extracted from the PMC Open Access subset. It is an updated version of the ROCO dataset published in 2018, and adds 35,705 new images added to PMC since 2018. It further provides manually curated concepts for imaging modalities with additional anatomical and directional concepts for X-rays. The dataset consists of 79,789 images and has been used, with minor modifications, in the concept detection and caption prediction tasks of ImageCLEFmedical Caption 2023. The dataset is suitable for training image annotation models based on image-caption pairs, or for multi-label image classification using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts provided with each image. In addition, it can serve for pre-training of medical domain models, and evaluation of deep learning models for multi-task learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Xue, Jingshuai Liu, Steven McDonagh, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is a promising paradigm for removing unwanted data samples from a trained model, towards ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and limiting harmful biases. Although unlearning has been shown in, e.g., classification and recommendation systems, its potential in medical image-to-image translation, specifically in image recon-struction, has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper shows that machine unlearning is possible in MRI tasks and has the potential to benefit for bias removal. We set up a protocol to study how much shared knowledge exists between datasets of different organs, allowing us to effectively quantify the effect of unlearning. Our study reveals that combining training data can lead to hallucinations and reduced image quality in the reconstructed data. We use unlearning to remove hallucinations as a proxy exemplar of undesired data removal. Indeed, we show that machine unlearning is possible without full retraining. Furthermore, our observations indicate that maintaining high performance is feasible even when using only a subset of retain data. We have made our code publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jiang, Yangxinyu Xie, Xiaomeng Wang, Weijie J. Su, Camillo J. Taylor, Tanwi Mallick</p>
<p>Abstract: Rationality is the quality of being guided by reason, characterized by logical thinking and decision-making that align with evidence and logical rules. This quality is essential for effective problem-solving, as it ensures that solutions are well-founded and systematically derived. Despite the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in generating human-like text with remarkable accuracy, they present biases inherited from the training data, inconsistency across different contexts, and difficulty understanding complex scenarios involving multiple layers of context. Therefore, recent research attempts to leverage the strength of multiple agents working collaboratively with various types of data and tools for enhanced consistency and reliability. To that end, this paper aims to understand whether multi-modal and multi-agent systems are advancing toward rationality by surveying the state-of-the-art works, identifying advancements over single-agent and single-modal systems in terms of rationality, and discussing open problems and future directions. We maintain an open repository at https://github.com/bowen-upenn/MMMA_Rationality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang-il Lee, Minbeom Kim, Minsung Kim, Dongryeol Lee, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various multimodal tasks. However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: CAD (Computer-Aided Design) plays a crucial role in mechanical industry, where large numbers of similar-shaped CAD parts are often created. Efficiently reusing these parts is key to reducing design and production costs for enterprises. Retrieval systems are vital for achieving CAD reuse, but the complex shapes of CAD models are difficult to accurately describe using text or keywords, making traditional retrieval methods ineffective. While existing representation learning approaches have been developed for CAD, manually labeling similar samples in these methods is expensive. Additionally, CAD models' unique parameterized data structure presents challenges for applying existing 3D shape representation learning techniques directly. In this work, we propose GC-CAD, a self-supervised contrastive graph neural network-based method for mechanical CAD retrieval that directly models parameterized CAD raw files. GC-CAD consists of two key modules: structure-aware representation learning and contrastive graph learning framework. The method leverages graph neural networks to extract both geometric and topological information from CAD models, generating feature representations. We then introduce a simple yet effective contrastive graph learning framework approach, enabling the model to train without manual labels and generate retrieval-ready representations. Experimental results on four datasets including human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements and up to 100 times efficiency improvement over the baseline methods.</p>
