<p>Document understanding refers to automatically extract, analyze and
comprehend information from various types of digital documents, such as a web
page. Existing Multi-model Large Language Models (MLLMs), including mPLUG-Owl,
have demonstrated promising zero-shot capabilities in shallow OCR-free text
recognition, indicating their potential for OCR-free document understanding.
Nevertheless, without in-domain training, these models tend to ignore
fine-grained OCR features, such as sophisticated tables or large blocks of
text, which are essential for OCR-free document understanding. In this paper,
we propose mPLUG-DocOwl based on mPLUG-Owl for OCR-free document understanding.
Specifically, we first construct a instruction tuning dataset featuring a wide
range of visual-text understanding tasks. Then, we strengthen the OCR-free
document understanding ability by jointly train the model on language-only,
general vision-and-language, and document instruction tuning dataset with our
unified instruction tuning strategy. We also build an OCR-free document
instruction understanding evaluation set LLMDoc to better compare models'
capabilities on instruct compliance and document understanding. Experimental
results show that our model outperforms existing multi-modal models,
demonstrating its strong ability of document understanding. Besides, without
specific fine-tuning, mPLUG-DocOwl generalizes well on various downstream
tasks. Our code, models, training data and evaluation set are available at

<p>The advancement in generative AI could be boosted with more accessible
mathematics. Beyond human-AI chat, large language models (LLMs) are emerging in
programming, algorithm discovery, and theorem proving, yet their genomics
application is limited. This project introduces Math Agents and mathematical
embedding as fresh entries to the "Moore's Law of Mathematics", using a
GPT-based workflow to convert equations from literature into LaTeX and Python
formats. While many digital equation representations exist, there's a lack of
automated large-scale evaluation tools. LLMs are pivotal as linguistic user
interfaces, providing natural language access for human-AI chat and formal
languages for large-scale AI-assisted computational infrastructure. Given the
infinite formal possibility spaces, Math Agents, which interact with math,
could potentially shift us from "big data" to "big math". Math, unlike the more
flexible natural language, has properties subject to proof, enabling its use
beyond traditional applications like high-validation math-certified icons for
AI alignment aims. This project aims to use Math Agents and mathematical
embeddings to address the ageing issue in information systems biology by
applying multiscalar physics mathematics to disease models and genomic data.
Generative AI with episodic memory could help analyse causal relations in
longitudinal health records, using SIR Precision Health models. Genomic data is
suggested for addressing the unsolved Alzheimer's disease problem.

<p>This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature concerning the
utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a particular
focus on transformer-based large language models (LLMs) trained using Big Code,
within the domain of AI-assisted programming tasks. LLMs, augmented with
software naturalness, have played a crucial role in facilitating AI-assisted
programming applications, including code generation, code completion, code
translation, code refinement, code summarization, defect detection, and clone

powered by OpenAI's Codex and DeepMind AlphaCode. This paper presents an
overview of the major LLMs and their applications in downstream tasks related
to AI-assisted programming. Furthermore, it explores the challenges and

<p>The article aims to analyze the performance of ChatGPT, a large language
model developed by OpenAI, in the context of cardiology and vascular
pathologies. The study evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering
challenging multiple-choice questions (QCM) using a dataset of 190 questions
from the Siamois-QCM platform. The goal was to assess ChatGPT potential as a
valuable tool in medical education compared to two well-ranked students of
medicine. The results showed that ChatGPT outperformed the students, scoring
175 out of 190 correct answers with a percentage of 92.10\%, while the two
students achieved scores of 163 and 159 with percentages of 85.78\% and
82.63\%, respectively. These results showcase how ChatGPT has the potential to
be highly effective in the fields of cardiology and vascular pathologies by
providing accurate answers to relevant questions.

<p>We address the named entity omission - the drawback of many current
abstractive text summarizers. We suggest a custom pretraining objective to
enhance the model's attention on the named entities in a text. At first, the
named entity recognition model RoBERTa is trained to determine named entities
in the text. After that, this model is used to mask named entities in the text
and the BART model is trained to reconstruct them. Next, the BART model is
fine-tuned on the summarization task. Our experiments showed that this
pretraining approach improves named entity inclusion precision and recall
metrics.

<p>Opioid related aberrant behaviors (ORAB) present novel risk factors for
opioid overdose. Previously, ORAB have been mainly assessed by survey results
and by monitoring drug administrations. Such methods however, cannot scale up
and do not cover the entire spectrum of aberrant behaviors. On the other hand,
ORAB are widely documented in electronic health record notes. This paper
introduces a novel biomedical natural language processing benchmark dataset
named ODD, for ORAB Detection Dataset. ODD is an expert-annotated dataset
comprising of more than 750 publicly available EHR notes. ODD has been designed
to identify ORAB from patients' EHR notes and classify them into nine
categories; 1) Confirmed Aberrant Behavior, 2) Suggested Aberrant Behavior, 3)
Opioids, 4) Indication, 5) Diagnosed opioid dependency, 6) Benzodiapines, 7)
Medication Changes, 8) Central Nervous System-related, and 9) Social
Determinants of Health. We explored two state-of-the-art natural language
processing (NLP) models (finetuning pretrained language models and
prompt-tuning approaches) to identify ORAB. Experimental results show that the
prompt-tuning models outperformed the finetuning models in most cateogories and
the gains were especially higher among uncommon categories (Suggested aberrant
behavior, Diagnosed opioid dependency and Medication change). Although the best
model achieved the highest 83.92\% on area under precision recall curve,
uncommon classes (Suggested Aberrant Behavior, Diagnosed Opioid Dependence, and
Medication Change) still have a large room for performance improvement.

<p>ChatGPT brings revolutionary social value but also raises concerns about the
misuse of AI-generated content. Consequently, an important question is how to
detect whether content is generated by ChatGPT or by human. Existing detectors
are built upon the assumption that there are distributional gaps between
human-generated and AI-generated content. These gaps are typically identified
using statistical information or classifiers. Our research challenges the
distributional gap assumption in detectors. We find that detectors do not
effectively discriminate the semantic and stylistic gaps between
human-generated and AI-generated content. Instead, the "subtle differences",
such as an extra space, become crucial for detection. Based on this discovery,
we propose the SpaceInfi strategy to evade detection. Experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of this strategy across multiple benchmarks and detectors. We
also provide a theoretical explanation for why SpaceInfi is successful in
evading perplexity-based detection. Our findings offer new insights and
challenges for understanding and constructing more applicable ChatGPT
detectors.

<p>Human language acquisition is an efficient, supervised, and continual
process. In this work, we took inspiration from how human babies acquire their
first language, and developed a computational process for word acquisition
through comparative learning. Motivated by cognitive findings, we generated a
small dataset that enables the computation models to compare the similarities
and differences of various attributes, learn to filter out and extract the
common information for each shared linguistic label. We frame the acquisition
of words as not only the information filtration process, but also as
representation-symbol mapping. This procedure does not involve a fixed
vocabulary size, nor a discriminative objective, and allows the models to
continually learn more concepts efficiently. Our results in controlled
experiments have shown the potential of this approach for efficient continual
learning of grounded words.

<p>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in
various natural language generation tasks. However, they incur high computation
cost and latency resulting from the autoregressive token-by-token generation.
To address this issue, several approaches have been proposed to reduce
computational cost using early-exit strategies. These strategies enable faster
text generation using reduced computation without applying the full computation
graph to each token. While existing token-level early exit methods show
promising results for online inference, they cannot be readily applied for
batch inferencing and Key-Value caching. This is because they have to wait
until the last token in a batch exits before they can stop computing. This
severely limits the practical application of such techniques. In this paper, we
propose a simple and effective token-level early exit method, SkipDecode,
designed to work seamlessly with batch inferencing and KV caching. It overcomes
prior constraints by setting up a singular exit point for every token in a
batch at each sequence position. It also guarantees a monotonic decrease in
exit points, thereby eliminating the need to recompute KV Caches for preceding
tokens. Rather than terminating computation prematurely as in prior works, our
approach bypasses lower to middle layers, devoting most of the computational
resources to upper layers, allowing later tokens to benefit from the compute
expenditure by earlier tokens. Our experimental results show that SkipDecode
can obtain 2x to 5x inference speedups with negligible regression across a
variety of tasks. This is achieved using OPT models of 1.3 billion and 6.7
billion parameters, all the while being directly compatible with batching and
KV caching optimization techniques.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02640">Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis of Plastic Surgery Social Media Posts. (arXiv:2307.02640v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ramnarine_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alexandrea K. Ramnarine</a></p>
<p>The massive collection of user posts across social media platforms is
primarily untapped for artificial intelligence (AI) use cases based on the
sheer volume and velocity of textual data. Natural language processing (NLP) is
a subfield of AI that leverages bodies of documents, known as corpora, to train
computers in human-like language understanding. Using a word ranking method,
term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), to create features across
documents, it is possible to perform unsupervised analytics, machine learning
(ML) that can group the documents without a human manually labeling the data.
For large datasets with thousands of features, t-distributed stochastic
neighbor embedding (t-SNE), k-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA) are employed to learn top words and generate topics for a Reddit and
Twitter combined corpus. Using extremely simple deep learning models, this
study demonstrates that the applied results of unsupervised analysis allow a
computer to predict either negative, positive, or neutral user sentiment
towards plastic surgery based on a tweet or subreddit post with almost 90%
accuracy. Furthermore, the model is capable of achieving higher accuracy on the
unsupervised sentiment task than on a rudimentary supervised document
classification task. Therefore, unsupervised learning may be considered a
viable option in labeling social media documents for NLP tasks.

<p>Dense video captioning, a task of localizing meaningful moments and
generating relevant captions for videos, often requires a large, expensive
corpus of annotated video segments paired with text. In an effort to minimize
the annotation cost, we propose ZeroTA, a novel method for dense video
captioning in a zero-shot manner. Our method does not require any videos or
annotations for training; instead, it localizes and describes events within
each input video at test time by optimizing solely on the input. This is
accomplished by introducing a soft moment mask that represents a temporal
segment in the video and jointly optimizing it with the prefix parameters of a
language model. This joint optimization aligns a frozen language generation
model (i.e., GPT-2) with a frozen vision-language contrastive model (i.e.,
CLIP) by maximizing the matching score between the generated text and a moment
within the video. We also introduce a pairwise temporal IoU loss to let a set
of soft moment masks capture multiple distinct events within the video. Our
method effectively discovers diverse significant events within the video, with
the resulting captions appropriately describing these events. The empirical
results demonstrate that ZeroTA surpasses zero-shot baselines and even
outperforms the state-of-the-art few-shot method on the widely-used benchmark
ActivityNet Captions. Moreover, our method shows greater robustness compared to
supervised methods when evaluated in out-of-domain scenarios. This research
provides insight into the potential of aligning widely-used models, such as
language generation models and vision-language models, to unlock a new
capability: understanding temporal aspects of videos.

<p>Text-based reinforcement learning agents have predominantly been neural
network-based models with embeddings-based representation, learning
uninterpretable policies that often do not generalize well to unseen games. On
the other hand, neuro-symbolic methods, specifically those that leverage an
intermediate formal representation, are gaining significant attention in
language understanding tasks. This is because of their advantages ranging from
inherent interpretability, the lesser requirement of training data, and being
generalizable in scenarios with unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a modular, NEuro-Symbolic Textual Agent (NESTA) that combines a generic
semantic parser with a rule induction system to learn abstract interpretable
rules as policies. Our experiments on established text-based game benchmarks
show that the proposed NESTA method outperforms deep reinforcement
learning-based techniques by achieving better generalization to unseen test
games and learning from fewer training interactions.

<p>The recent surge of large language models (LLMs) highlights their ability to
perform in-context learning, i.e., "learning" to perform a task from a few
demonstrations in the context without any parameter updates. However, their
capabilities of in-context learning are limited by the model architecture: 1)
the use of demonstrations is constrained by a maximum sentence length due to
positional embeddings; 2) the quadratic complexity of attention hinders users
from using more demonstrations efficiently; 3) LLMs are shown to be sensitive
to the order of the demonstrations. In this work, we tackle these challenges by
proposing a better architectural design for in-context learning. We propose
SAICL (Structured Attention for In-Context Learning), which replaces the
full-attention by a structured attention mechanism designed for in-context
learning, and removes unnecessary dependencies between individual
demonstrations, while making the model invariant to the permutation of
demonstrations. We evaluate SAICL in a meta-training framework and show that
SAICL achieves comparable or better performance than full attention while
obtaining up to 3.4x inference speed-up. SAICL also consistently outperforms a
strong Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) baseline which processes each demonstration
independently. Finally, thanks to its linear nature, we demonstrate that SAICL
can easily scale to hundreds of demonstrations with continuous performance
gains with scaling.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02697">Statistical Mechanics of Strahler Number via Random and Natural Language Sentences. (arXiv:2307.02697v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>The Strahler number was originally proposed to characterize the complexity of
river bifurcation and has found various applications. This article proposes
computation of the Strahler number's upper and lower limits for natural
language sentence tree structures, which are available in a large dataset
allowing for statistical mechanics analysis.
</p>
<p>Through empirical measurements across grammatically annotated data, the
Strahler number of natural language sentences is shown to be almost always 3 or
4, similar to the case of river bifurcation as reported by Strahler (1957) and
Horton (1945).
</p>
<p>From the theory behind the number, we show that it is the lower limit of the
amount of memory required to process sentences under a particular model. A
mathematical analysis of random trees provides a further conjecture on the
nature of the Strahler number, revealing that it is not a constant but grows
logarithmically. This finding uncovers the statistical basics behind the
Strahler number as a characteristic of a general tree structure target.

<p>Multimodal summarization usually suffers from the problem that the
contribution of the visual modality is unclear. Existing multimodal
summarization approaches focus on designing the fusion methods of different
modalities, while ignoring the adaptive conditions under which visual
modalities are useful. Therefore, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine
contribution network for multimodal Summarization (CFSum) to consider different
contributions of images for summarization. First, to eliminate the interference
of useless images, we propose a pre-filter module to abandon useless images.
Second, to make accurate use of useful images, we propose two levels of visual
complement modules, word level and phrase level. Specifically, image
contributions are calculated and are adopted to guide the attention of both
textual and visual modalities. Experimental results have shown that CFSum
significantly outperforms multiple strong baselines on the standard benchmark.
Furthermore, the analysis verifies that useful images can even help generate
non-visual words which are implicitly represented in the image.

<p>Large self-supervised models are effective feature extractors, but their
application is challenging under on-device budget constraints and biased
dataset collection, especially in keyword spotting. To address this, we
proposed a knowledge distillation-based self-supervised speech representation
learning (S3RL) architecture for on-device keyword spotting. Our approach used
a teacher-student framework to transfer knowledge from a larger, more complex
model to a smaller, light-weight model using dual-view cross-correlation
distillation and the teacher's codebook as learning objectives. We evaluated
our model's performance on an Alexa keyword spotting detection task using a
16.6k-hour in-house dataset. Our technique showed exceptional performance in
normal and noisy conditions, demonstrating the efficacy of knowledge
distillation methods in constructing self-supervised models for keyword
spotting tasks while working within on-device resource constraints.

<p>Large language models (LLMs), typically designed as a function of next-word
prediction, have excelled across extensive NLP tasks. Despite the generality,
next-word prediction is often not an efficient formulation for many of the
tasks, demanding an extreme scale of model parameters (10s or 100s of billions)
and sometimes yielding suboptimal performance. In practice, it is often
desirable to build more efficient models -- despite being less versatile, they
still apply to a substantial subset of problems, delivering on par or even
superior performance with much smaller model sizes. In this paper, we propose
text alignment as an efficient unified model for a wide range of crucial tasks
involving text entailment, similarity, question answering (and answerability),
factual consistency, and so forth. Given a pair of texts, the model measures
the degree of alignment between their information. We instantiate an alignment
model (Align) through lightweight finetuning of RoBERTa (355M parameters) using
5.9M examples from 28 datasets. Despite its compact size, extensive experiments
show the model's efficiency and strong performance: (1) On over 20 datasets of
aforementioned diverse tasks, the model matches or surpasses FLAN-T5 models
that have around 2x or 10x more parameters; the single unified model also
outperforms task-specific models finetuned on individual datasets; (2) When
applied to evaluate factual consistency of language generation on 23 datasets,
our model improves over various baselines, including the much larger GPT-3.5
(ChatGPT) and sometimes even GPT-4; (3) The lightweight model can also serve as
an add-on component for LLMs such as GPT-3.5 in question answering tasks,
improving the average exact match (EM) score by 17.94 and F1 score by 15.05
through identifying unanswerable questions.

<p>In information retrieval (IR), domain adaptation is the process of adapting a
retrieval model to a new domain whose data distribution is different from the
source domain. Existing methods in this area focus on unsupervised domain
adaptation where they have access to the target document collection or
supervised (often few-shot) domain adaptation where they additionally have
access to (limited) labeled data in the target domain. There also exists
research on improving zero-shot performance of retrieval models with no
adaptation. This paper introduces a new category of domain adaptation in IR
that is as-yet unexplored. Here, similar to the zero-shot setting, we assume
the retrieval model does not have access to the target document collection. In
contrast, it does have access to a brief textual description that explains the
target domain. We define a taxonomy of domain attributes in retrieval tasks to
understand different properties of a source domain that can be adapted to a
target domain. We introduce a novel automatic data construction pipeline that
produces a synthetic document collection, query set, and pseudo relevance
labels, given a textual domain description. Extensive experiments on five
diverse target domains show that adapting dense retrieval models using the
constructed synthetic data leads to effective retrieval performance on the
target domain.

<p>Linguistic style matching (LSM) in conversations can be reflective of several
aspects of social influence such as power or persuasion. However, how LSM
relates to the outcomes of online communication on platforms such as Reddit is
an unknown question. In this study, we analyze a large corpus of two-party
conversation threads in Reddit where we identify all occurrences of LSM using
two types of style: the use of function words and formality. Using this
framework, we examine how levels of LSM differ in conversations depending on
several social factors within Reddit: post and subreddit features, conversation
depth, user tenure, and the controversiality of a comment. Finally, we measure
the change of LSM following loss of status after community banning. Our
findings reveal the interplay of LSM in Reddit conversations with several
community metrics, suggesting the importance of understanding conversation
engagement when understanding community dynamics.

<p>Nowadays, the quality of responses generated by different modern large
language models (LLMs) are hard to evaluate and compare automatically. Recent
studies suggest and predominantly use LLMs as a reference-free metric for
open-ended question answering. More specifically, they use the recognized
"strongest" LLM as the evaluator, which conducts pairwise comparisons of
candidate models' answers and provides a ranking score. However, this intuitive
method has multiple problems, such as bringing in self-enhancement (favoring
its own answers) and positional bias. We draw insights and lessons from the
educational domain (Cho and MacArthur, 2011; Walsh, 2014) to improve LLM-based
evaluations. Specifically, we propose the (1) peer rank (PR) algorithm that
takes into account each peer LLM's pairwise preferences of all answer pairs,
and outputs a final ranking of models; and (2) peer discussion (PD), where we
prompt two LLMs to discuss and try to reach a mutual agreement on preferences
of two answers. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets. We find that
our approaches achieve higher accuracy and align better with human judgments,
respectively. Interestingly, PR can induce a relatively accurate self-ranking
of models under the anonymous setting, where each model's name is unrevealed.
Our work provides space to explore evaluating models that are hard to compare
for humans.

<p>Understanding interpersonal communication requires, in part, understanding
the social context and norms in which a message is said. However, current
methods for identifying offensive content in such communication largely operate
independent of context, with only a few approaches considering community norms
or prior conversation as context. Here, we introduce a new approach to
identifying inappropriate communication by explicitly modeling the social
relationship between the individuals. We introduce a new dataset of
contextually-situated judgments of appropriateness and show that large language
models can readily incorporate relationship information to accurately identify
appropriateness in a given context. Using data from online conversations and
movie dialogues, we provide insight into how the relationships themselves
function as implicit norms and quantify the degree to which context-sensitivity
is needed in different conversation settings. Further, we also demonstrate that
contextual-appropriateness judgments are predictive of other social factors
expressed in language such as condescension and politeness.

<p>Many cognitive approaches to well-being, such as recognizing and reframing
unhelpful thoughts, have received considerable empirical support over the past
decades, yet still lack truly widespread adoption in self-help format. A
barrier to that adoption is a lack of adequately specific and diverse dedicated
practice material. This work examines whether current language models can be
leveraged to both produce a virtually unlimited quantity of practice material
illustrating standard unhelpful thought patterns matching specific given
contexts, and generate suitable positive reframing proposals. We propose
PATTERNREFRAME, a novel dataset of about 10k examples of thoughts containing
unhelpful thought patterns conditioned on a given persona, accompanied by about
27k positive reframes. By using this dataset to train and/or evaluate current
models, we show that existing models can already be powerful tools to help
generate an abundance of tailored practice material and hypotheses, with no or
minimal additional model training required.

<p>The rapid advances of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are
revolutionizing data science and statistics. These state-of-the-art tools can
streamline complex processes. As a result, it reshapes the role of data
scientists. We argue that LLMs are transforming the responsibilities of data
scientists, shifting their focus from hands-on coding, data-wrangling and
conducting standard analyses to assessing and managing analyses performed by
these automated AIs. This evolution of roles is reminiscent of the transition
from a software engineer to a product manager. We illustrate this transition
with concrete data science case studies using LLMs in this paper. These
developments necessitate a meaningful evolution in data science education.
Pedagogy must now place greater emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among
students, such as LLM-informed creativity, critical thinking, AI-guided
programming. LLMs can also play a significant role in the classroom as
interactive teaching and learning tools, contributing to personalized
education. This paper discusses the opportunities, resources and open
challenges for each of these directions. As with any transformative technology,
integrating LLMs into education calls for careful consideration. While LLMs can
perform repetitive tasks efficiently, it's crucial to remember that their role
is to supplement human intelligence and creativity, not to replace it.
Therefore, the new era of data science education should balance the benefits of
LLMs while fostering complementary human expertise and innovations. In
conclusion, the rise of LLMs heralds a transformative period for data science
and its education. This paper seeks to shed light on the emerging trends,
potential opportunities, and challenges accompanying this paradigm shift,
hoping to spark further discourse and investigation into this exciting,
uncharted territory.

<p>Generative AI has made significant strides, yet concerns about the accuracy

serious consequences such as inaccurate decision-making, the spread of false

to address these risks are underway, including explainable AI and responsible
AI practices such as transparency, privacy protection, bias mitigation, and
social and environmental responsibility, misinformation caused by generative AI
will remain a significant challenge. We propose that verifying the outputs of
generative AI from a data management perspective is an emerging issue for
generative AI. This involves analyzing the underlying data from multi-modal
data lakes, including text files, tables, and knowledge graphs, and assessing
its quality and consistency. By doing so, we can establish a stronger

<p>News summary generation is an important task in the field of intelligence
analysis, which can provide accurate and comprehensive information to help
people better understand and respond to complex real-world events. However,
traditional news summary generation methods face some challenges, which are
limited by the model itself and the amount of training data, as well as the
influence of text noise, making it difficult to generate reliable information
accurately. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for news summary
generation using LLM with powerful natural language understanding and
generative capabilities. We use LLM to extract multiple structured event
patterns from the events contained in news paragraphs, evolve the event pattern
population with genetic algorithm, and select the most adaptive event pattern
to input into the LLM to generate news summaries. A News Summary Generator

<p>Reasoning has been a central topic in artificial intelligence from the

networks continues to improve the state-of-the-art performance of natural

perform real reasoning to reach their conclusions or rely on spurious
correlations. Adversarial attacks have proven to be an important tool to help
evaluate the Achilles' heel of the victim models. In this study, we explore the
fundamental problem of developing attack models based on logic formalism. We
propose NatLogAttack to perform systematic attacks centring around natural
logic, a classical logic formalism that is traceable back to Aristotle's
syllogism and has been closely developed for natural language inference. The
proposed framework renders both label-preserving and label-flipping attacks. We
show that compared to the existing attack models, NatLogAttack generates better
adversarial examples with fewer visits to the victim models. The victim models
are found to be more vulnerable under the label-flipping setting. NatLogAttack
provides a tool to probe the existing and future NLI models' capacity from a
key viewpoint and we hope more logic-based attacks will be further explored for
understanding the desired property of reasoning.

<p>Guidance on how to validate computational text-based measures of social
science constructs is fragmented. Whereas scholars are generally acknowledging
the importance of validating their text-based measures, they often lack common
terminology and a unified framework to do so. This paper introduces a new
validation framework called ValiTex, designed to assist scholars to measure
social science constructs based on textual data. The framework draws on a
long-established tradition within psychometrics while extending the framework
for the purpose of computational text analysis. ValiTex consists of two
components, a conceptual model, and a dynamic checklist. Whereas the conceptual
model provides a general structure along distinct phases on how to approach
validation, the dynamic checklist defines specific validation steps and
provides guidance on which steps might be considered recommendable (i.e.,
providing relevant and necessary validation evidence) or optional (i.e., useful
for providing additional supporting validation evidence. The utility of the
framework is demonstrated by applying it to a use case of detecting sexism from
social media data.

<p>In this study, we analyze data-scarce classification scenarios, where
available labeled legal data is small and imbalanced, potentially hurting the
quality of the results. We focused on two finetuning objectives; SetFit
(Sentence Transformer Finetuning), a contrastive learning setup, and a vanilla
finetuning setup on a legal provision classification task. Additionally, we
compare the features that are extracted with LIME (Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations) to see which particular features contributed to
the model's classification decisions. The results show that a contrastive setup
with SetFit performed better than vanilla finetuning while using a fraction of
the training samples. LIME results show that the contrastive learning approach
helps boost both positive and negative features which are legally informative
and contribute to the classification results. Thus a model finetuned with a
contrastive objective seems to base its decisions more confidently on legally
informative features.

<p>This work shows that depression changes the correlation between features
extracted from speech. Furthermore, it shows that using such an insight can
improve the training speed and performance of depression detectors based on
SVMs and LSTMs. The experiments were performed over the Androids Corpus, a
publicly available dataset involving 112 speakers, including 58 people
diagnosed with depression by professional psychiatrists. The results show that
the models used in the experiments improve in terms of training speed and
performance when fed with feature correlation matrices rather than with feature
vectors. The relative reduction of the error rate ranges between 23.1% and
26.6% depending on the model. The probable explanation is that feature
correlation matrices appear to be more variable in the case of depressed
speakers. Correspondingly, such a phenomenon can be thought of as a depression
marker.

completion of morphosyntactic patterns. The semantic properties considered are
telicity (also combined with definiteness) and agentivity. Both act at the

<p>Textual noise, such as typos or abbreviations, is a well-known issue that
penalizes vanilla Transformers for most downstream tasks. We show that this is
also the case for sentence similarity, a fundamental task in multiple domains,
e.g. matching, retrieval or paraphrasing. Sentence similarity can be approached
using cross-encoders, where the two sentences are concatenated in the input
allowing the model to exploit the inter-relations between them. Previous works
addressing the noise issue mainly rely on data augmentation strategies, showing
improved robustness when dealing with corrupted samples that are similar to the
ones used for training. However, all these methods still suffer from the token
distribution shift induced by typos. In this work, we propose to tackle textual
noise by equipping cross-encoders with a novel LExical-aware Attention module
(LEA) that incorporates lexical similarities between words in both sentences.
By using raw text similarities, our approach avoids the tokenization shift
problem obtaining improved robustness. We demonstrate that the attention bias
introduced by LEA helps cross-encoders to tackle complex scenarios with textual
noise, specially in domains with short-text descriptions and limited context.
Experiments using three popular Transformer encoders in five e-commerce
datasets for product matching show that LEA consistently boosts performance
under the presence of noise, while remaining competitive on the original
(clean) splits. We also evaluate our approach in two datasets for textual
entailment and paraphrasing showing that LEA is robust to typos in domains with
longer sentences and more natural context. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze
several design choices in our approach, providing insights about the impact of
the decisions made and fostering future research in cross-encoders dealing with
typos.

<p>One challenge in text-to-image (T2I) generation is the inadvertent reflection
of culture gaps present in the training data, which signifies the disparity in
generated image quality when the cultural elements of the input text are rarely
collected in the training set. Although various T2I models have shown
impressive but arbitrary examples, there is no benchmark to systematically
evaluate a T2I model's ability to generate cross-cultural images. To bridge the
gap, we propose a Challenging Cross-Cultural (C3) benchmark with comprehensive
evaluation criteria, which can assess how well-suited a model is to a target
culture. By analyzing the flawed images generated by the Stable Diffusion model
on the C3 benchmark, we find that the model often fails to generate certain
cultural objects. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-modal metric that
considers object-text alignment to filter the fine-tuning data in the target
culture, which is used to fine-tune a T2I model to improve cross-cultural
generation. Experimental results show that our multi-modal metric provides
stronger data selection performance on the C3 benchmark than existing metrics,
in which the object-text alignment is crucial. We release the benchmark, data,
code, and generated images to facilitate future research on culturally diverse
T2I generation (https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/C3-Bench).

<p>This paper provides a reference description, in the form of a deduction
system, of Earley's (1970) context-free parsing algorithm with various
speed-ups. Our presentation includes a known worst-case runtime improvement
from Earley's $O (N^3|G||R|)$, which is unworkable for the large grammars that
arise in natural language processing, to $O (N^3|G|)$, which matches the
runtime of CKY on a binarized version of the grammar $G$. Here $N$ is the
length of the sentence, $|R|$ is the number of productions in $G$, and $|G|$ is
the total length of those productions. We also provide a version that achieves
runtime of $O (N^3|M|)$ with $|M| \leq |G|$ when the grammar is represented
compactly as a single finite-state automaton $M$ (this is partly novel). We
carefully treat the generalization to semiring-weighted deduction,
preprocessing the grammar like Stolcke (1995) to eliminate deduction cycles,
and further generalize Stolcke's method to compute the weights of sentence
prefixes. We also provide implementation details for efficient execution,
ensuring that on a preprocessed grammar, the semiring-weighted versions of our
methods have the same asymptotic runtime and space requirements as the
unweighted methods, including sub-cubic runtime on some grammars.

<p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, accurately and
comprehensively evaluating their performance becomes increasingly challenging.
Conventionally, human evaluations are considered the gold standard in natural
language generation. Recent advancements incorporate state-of-the-art LLMs as
proxies for human judges in evaluation processes. Nonetheless, the extent to
which humans and LLMs are capable evaluators remains uncertain. This study aims
to investigate the behavior of both crowd-sourced human and LLM-based judges
when comparing outputs from different models. To accomplish this, we curate a
dataset comprising intentionally flawed machine-generated answers. Our findings
indicate that despite the potentially greater danger posed by factual errors,
answers with factual errors were still rated more favorably compared to answers
that were too short or contained grammatical errors. This highlights a
concerning bias in the evaluation process. To address this issue, we propose to
independently evaluate machine-generated text across multiple dimensions,
rather than merging all the evaluation aspects into a single score. We
instantiate this idea with the Elo rating system, resulting in the Multi-Elo
Rating System. Empirical results from our study reveal that this proposed
approach significantly enhances the quality of LLM-based evaluations,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. However, notable improvement is not
observed in crowd-sourced-based evaluations, suggesting the need for further
investigation and refinement.

<p>Retrieval augmentation enables large language models to take advantage of
external knowledge, for example on tasks like question answering and data
imputation. However, the performance of such retrieval-augmented models is
limited by the data quality of their underlying retrieval corpus. In this
paper, we propose an algorithm based on multilinear extension for evaluating
the data importance of retrieved data points. There are exponentially many
terms in the multilinear extension, and one key contribution of this paper is a
polynomial time algorithm that computes exactly, given a retrieval-augmented
model with an additive utility function and a validation set, the data
importance of data points in the retrieval corpus using the multilinear
extension of the model's utility function. We further proposed an even more
efficient ({\epsilon}, {\delta})-approximation algorithm. Our experimental
results illustrate that we can enhance the performance of large language models
by only pruning or reweighting the retrieval corpus, without requiring further
training. For some tasks, this even allows a small model (e.g., GPT-JT),
augmented with a search engine API, to outperform GPT-3.5 (without retrieval
augmentation). Moreover, we show that weights based on multilinear extension
can be computed efficiently in practice (e.g., in less than ten minutes for a
corpus with 100 million elements).

<p>Adapting pretrained language models to novel domains, such as clinical
applications, traditionally involves retraining their entire set of parameters.
However, this approach is increasingly proven to be impractical owing to the
substantial computational requirements associated with training such large
language models. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
techniques offer a viable solution by selectively fine-tuning a small subset of
additional parameters, significantly reducing the computational requirements
for domain adaptation. In this study, we propose Clinical LLaMA-LoRA, a PEFT
adapter layer built upon the open-sourced LLaMA model. Clinical LLaMA-LoRA is
trained using clinical notes obtained from the MIMIC-IV database, thereby
creating a specialised adapter designed for the clinical domain. Additionally,
we propose a two-step PEFT framework which fuses Clinical LLaMA-LoRA with
Downstream LLaMA-LoRA, another PEFT adapter specialised for downstream tasks.
We evaluate this framework on multiple clinical outcome prediction datasets,
comparing it to clinically trained language models. Our proposed framework
achieves a state-of-the-art AUROC score averaged across all clinical downstream
tasks. We observe substantial improvements of 6-9% AUROC score in the
large-scale multilabel classification tasks, such as diagnoses and procedures

<p>Applying deep learning techniques, particularly language models (LMs), in
ontology engineering has raised widespread attention. However, deep learning
frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow are predominantly developed for Python
programming, while widely-used ontology APIs, such as the OWL API and Jena, are
primarily Java-based. To facilitate seamless integration of these frameworks
and APIs, we present Deeponto, a Python package designed for ontology
engineering. The package encompasses a core ontology processing module founded
on the widely-recognised and reliable OWL API, encapsulating its fundamental
features in a more "Pythonic" manner and extending its capabilities to include
other essential components including reasoning, verbalisation, normalisation,
projection, and more. Building on this module, Deeponto offers a suite of
tools, resources, and algorithms that support various ontology engineering
tasks, such as ontology alignment and completion, by harnessing deep learning
methodologies, primarily pre-trained LMs. In this paper, we also demonstrate
the practical utility of Deeponto through two use-cases: the Digital Health

<p>The scale of large pre-trained models (PTMs) poses significant challenges in
adapting to downstream tasks due to the high optimization overhead and storage
costs associated with full-parameter fine-tuning. To address this, many studies
explore parameter-efficient tuning methods, also framed as "delta tuning",
which updates only a small subset of parameters, known as "delta modules",
while keeping the backbone model's parameters fixed. However, the practicality
and flexibility of delta tuning have been limited due to existing
implementations that directly modify the code of the backbone PTMs and
hard-code specific delta tuning methods for each PTM. In this paper, we present
OpenDelta, an open-source library that overcomes these limitations by providing
a plug-and-play implementation of various delta tuning methods. Our novel
techniques eliminate the need to modify the backbone PTMs' code, making
OpenDelta compatible with different, even novel PTMs. OpenDelta is designed to
be simple, modular, and extensible, providing a comprehensive platform for
researchers and practitioners to adapt large PTMs efficiently.

<p>Sentence embeddings enable us to capture the semantic similarity of short
texts. Most sentence embedding models are trained for general semantic textual
similarity (STS) tasks. Therefore, to use sentence embeddings in a particular
domain, the model must be adapted to it in order to achieve good results.
Usually, this is done by fine-tuning the entire sentence embedding model for
the domain of interest. While this approach yields state-of-the-art results,
all of the model's weights are updated during fine-tuning, making this method
resource-intensive. Therefore, instead of fine-tuning entire sentence embedding
models for each target domain individually, we propose to train lightweight
adapters. These domain-specific adapters do not require fine-tuning all
underlying sentence embedding model parameters. Instead, we only train a small
number of additional parameters while keeping the weights of the underlying
sentence embedding model fixed. Training domain-specific adapters allows always
using the same base model and only exchanging the domain-specific adapters to
adapt sentence embeddings to a specific domain. We show that using adapters for
parameter-efficient domain adaptation of sentence embeddings yields competitive
performance within 1% of a domain-adapted, entirely fine-tuned sentence
embedding model while only training approximately 3.6% of the parameters.

examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive
review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions:
what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide
an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general
natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics,
educations, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas.
Secondly, we answer the `where' and `how' questions by diving into the
evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in
assessing performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases
of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges
that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to
researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of
more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an
essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently

<p>Deep text understanding, which requires the connections between a given
document and prior knowledge beyond its text, has been highlighted by many
benchmarks in recent years. However, these benchmarks have encountered two
major limitations. On the one hand, most of them require human annotation of
knowledge, which leads to limited knowledge coverage. On the other hand, they
usually use choices or spans in the texts as the answers, which results in
narrow answer space. To overcome these limitations, we build a new challenging
benchmark named KoRc in this paper. Compared with previous benchmarks, KoRC has
two advantages, i.e., broad knowledge coverage and flexible answer format.
Specifically, we utilize massive knowledge bases to guide annotators or large
language models (LLMs) to construct knowledgable questions. Moreover, we use
labels in knowledge bases rather than spans or choices as the final answers. We
test state-of-the-art models on KoRC and the experimental results show that the
strongest baseline only achieves 68.3% and 30.0% F1 measure in the
in-distribution and out-of-distribution test set, respectively. These results
indicate that deep text understanding is still an unsolved challenge. The
benchmark dataset, leaderboard, and baseline methods are released in

<p>The widespread usage of latent language representations via pre-trained
language models (LMs) suggests that they are a promising source of structured
knowledge. However, existing methods focus only on a single object per
subject-relation pair, even though often multiple objects are correct. To
overcome this limitation, we analyze these representations for their potential
to yield materialized multi-object relational knowledge. We formulate the
problem as a rank-then-select task. For ranking candidate objects, we evaluate
existing prompting techniques and propose new ones incorporating domain
knowledge. Among the selection methods, we find that choosing objects with a
likelihood above a learned relation-specific threshold gives a 49.5% F1 score.
Our results highlight the difficulty of employing LMs for the multi-valued
slot-filling task and pave the way for further research on extracting
relational knowledge from latent language representations.

<p>We present Visual Knowledge oriented Programming platform (VisKoP), a
knowledge base question answering (KBQA) system that integrates human into the
loop to edit and debug the knowledge base (KB) queries. VisKoP not only
provides a neural program induction module, which converts natural language
questions into knowledge oriented program language (KoPL), but also maps KoPL
programs into graphical elements. KoPL programs can be edited with simple
graphical operators, such as dragging to add knowledge operators and slot
filling to designate operator arguments. Moreover, VisKoP provides
auto-completion for its knowledge base schema and users can easily debug the
KoPL program by checking its intermediate results. To facilitate the practical
KBQA on a million-entity-level KB, we design a highly efficient KoPL execution
engine for the back-end. Experiment results show that VisKoP is highly
efficient and user interaction can fix a large portion of wrong KoPL programs
to acquire the correct answer. The VisKoP online demo

<p>Automatic metrics play a crucial role in machine translation. Despite the
widespread use of n-gram-based metrics, there has been a recent surge in the
development of pre-trained model-based metrics that focus on measuring sentence
semantics. However, these neural metrics, while achieving higher correlations
with human evaluations, are often considered to be black boxes with potential
biases that are difficult to detect. In this study, we systematically analyze
and compare various mainstream and cutting-edge automatic metrics from the
perspective of their guidance for training machine translation systems. Through
Minimum Risk Training (MRT), we find that certain metrics exhibit robustness
defects, such as the presence of universal adversarial translations in BLEURT
and BARTScore. In-depth analysis suggests two main causes of these robustness
deficits: distribution biases in the training datasets, and the tendency of the
metric paradigm. By incorporating token-level constraints, we enhance the
robustness of evaluation metrics, which in turn leads to an improvement in the
performance of machine translation systems. Codes are available at

<p>Large web-sourced multimodal datasets have powered a slew of new methods for
learning general-purpose visual representations, advancing the state of the art
in computer vision and revolutionizing zero- and few-shot recognition. One
crucial decision facing practitioners is how, if at all, to curate these
ever-larger datasets. For example, the creators of the LAION-5B dataset chose
to retain only image-caption pairs whose CLIP similarity score exceeded a
designated threshold. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art data
filtering approach motivated by our observation that nearly 40% of LAION's
images contain text that overlaps significantly with the caption. Intuitively,
such data could be wasteful as it incentivizes models to perform optical
character recognition rather than learning visual features. However, naively
removing all such data could also be wasteful, as it throws away images that
contain visual features (in addition to overlapping text). Our simple and
scalable approach, T-MARS (Text Masking and Re-Scoring), filters out only those
pairs where the text dominates the remaining visual features -- by first
masking out the text and then filtering out those with a low CLIP similarity
score of the masked image. Experimentally, T-MARS outperforms the top-ranked
method on the "medium scale" of DataComp (a data filtering benchmark) by a
margin of 6.5% on ImageNet and 4.7% on VTAB. Additionally, our systematic
evaluation on various data pool sizes from 2M to 64M shows that the accuracy
gains enjoyed by T-MARS linearly increase as data and compute are scaled
exponentially. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/T-MARS.

<p>Large vision-language models have achieved outstanding performance, but their
size and computational requirements make their deployment on
resource-constrained devices and time-sensitive tasks impractical. Model
distillation, the process of creating smaller, faster models that maintain the
performance of larger models, is a promising direction towards the solution.
This paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large
teacher vision-language models into lightweight student models using a small-
or mid-scale dataset. Notably, this study focuses on open-vocabulary
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a challenging problem that has been
overlooked in previous model distillation literature. We propose two principles
from vision and language modality perspectives to enhance student's OOD
generalization: (1) by better imitating teacher's visual representation space,
and carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the
teacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with
informative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish
between different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive
experiments to investigate their techniques. The results demonstrate
significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot student performance on
open-vocabulary out-of-distribution classification, highlighting the
effectiveness of our proposed approaches. Our code will be released at

<p>Large language models have an exceptional capability to incorporate new
information in a contextual manner. However, the full potential of such an
approach is often restrained due to a limitation in the effective context
length. One solution to this issue is to endow an attention layer with access
to an external memory, which comprises of (key, value) pairs. Yet, as the
number of documents increases, the proportion of relevant keys to irrelevant
ones decreases, leading the model to focus more on the irrelevant keys. We
identify a significant challenge, dubbed the distraction issue, where keys
linked to different semantic values might overlap, making them hard to
distinguish. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Focused Transformer
(FoT), a technique that employs a training process inspired by contrastive
learning. This novel approach enhances the structure of the (key, value) space,
enabling an extension of the context length. Our method allows for fine-tuning
pre-existing, large-scale models to lengthen their effective context. This is
demonstrated by our fine-tuning of $3B$ and $7B$ OpenLLaMA checkpoints. The
resulting models, which we name LongLLaMA, exhibit advancements in tasks
requiring a long context. We further illustrate that our LongLLaMA models
adeptly manage a $256 k$ context length for passkey retrieval.

<p>While recent language models have the ability to take long contexts as input,
relatively little is known about how well the language models use longer
context. We analyze language model performance on two tasks that require
identifying relevant information within their input contexts: multi-document
question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance is often
highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input
context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant
information in the middle of long contexts. Furthermore, performance
substantially decreases as the input context grows longer, even for explicitly
long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how

<p>Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation, which is first proposed in neural
machine translation (NMT) to speed up inference, has attracted much attention
in both machine learning and natural language processing communities. While NAR
generation can significantly accelerate inference speed for machine
translation, the speedup comes at the cost of sacrificed translation accuracy
compared to its counterpart, autoregressive (AR) generation. In recent years,
many new models and algorithms have been designed/proposed to bridge the
accuracy gap between NAR generation and AR generation. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of various
non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models from different aspects.
Specifically, we categorize the efforts of NAT into several groups, including
data manipulation, modeling methods, training criterion, decoding algorithms,
and the benefit from pre-trained models. Furthermore, we briefly review other
applications of NAR models beyond machine translation, such as grammatical
error correction, text summarization, text style transfer, dialogue, semantic
parsing, automatic speech recognition, and so on. In addition, we also discuss
potential directions for future exploration, including releasing the dependency
of KD, reasonable training objectives, pre-training for NAR, and wider
applications, etc. We hope this survey can help researchers capture the latest
progress in NAR generation, inspire the design of advanced NAR models and
algorithms, and enable industry practitioners to choose appropriate solutions
for their applications. The web page of this survey is at

<p>Large neural networks can now generate jokes, but do they really "understand"
humor? We challenge AI models with three tasks derived from the New Yorker
Cartoon Caption Contest: matching a joke to a cartoon, identifying a winning
caption, and explaining why a winning caption is funny. These tasks encapsulate
progressively more sophisticated aspects of "understanding" a cartoon; key
elements are the complex, often surprising relationships between images and
captions and the frequent inclusion of indirect and playful allusions to human
experience and culture. We investigate both multimodal and language-only
models: the former are challenged with the cartoon images directly, while the
latter are given multifaceted descriptions of the visual scene to simulate
human-level visual understanding. We find that both types of models struggle at
all three tasks. For example, our best multimodal models fall 30 accuracy
points behind human performance on the matching task, and, even when provided
ground-truth visual scene descriptors, human-authored explanations are
preferred head-to-head over the best machine-authored ones (few-shot GPT-4) in
more than 2/3 of cases. We release models, code, leaderboard, and corpus, which

<p>Chinese spelling check is a task to detect and correct spelling mistakes in
Chinese text. Existing research aims to enhance the text representation and use
multi-source information to improve the detection and correction capabilities
of models, but does not pay too much attention to improving their ability to
distinguish between confusable words. Contrastive learning, whose aim is to
minimize the distance in representation space between similar sample pairs, has
recently become a dominant technique in natural language processing. Inspired
by contrastive learning, we present a novel framework for Chinese spelling
checking, which consists of three modules: language representation, spelling
check and reverse contrastive learning. Specifically, we propose a reverse
contrastive learning strategy, which explicitly forces the model to minimize
the agreement between the similar examples, namely, the phonetically and
visually confusable characters. Experimental results show that our framework is
model-agnostic and could be combined with existing Chinese spelling check
models to yield state-of-the-art performance.

<p>The effectiveness of contrastive learning technology in natural language
processing tasks is yet to be explored and analyzed. How to construct positive
and negative samples correctly and reasonably is the core challenge of
contrastive learning. It is even harder to discover contrastive objects in
multi-label text classification tasks. There are very few contrastive losses
proposed previously. In this paper, we investigate the problem from a different
angle by proposing five novel contrastive losses for multi-label text
classification tasks. These are Strict Contrastive Loss (SCL), Intra-label
Contrastive Loss (ICL), Jaccard Similarity Contrastive Loss (JSCL), Jaccard
Similarity Probability Contrastive Loss (JSPCL), and Stepwise Label Contrastive
Loss (SLCL). We explore the effectiveness of contrastive learning for
multi-label text classification tasks by the employment of these novel losses
and provide a set of baseline models for deploying contrastive learning
techniques on specific tasks. We further perform an interpretable analysis of
our approach to show how different components of contrastive learning losses
play their roles. The experimental results show that our proposed contrastive
losses can bring improvement to multi-label text classification tasks. Our work
also explores how contrastive learning should be adapted for multi-label text
classification tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Koishekenov_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yeskendir Koishekenov</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Nikoulina_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">Vassilina Nikoulina</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Berard_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alexandre Berard</a></p>
<p>Compared to conventional bilingual translation systems, massively
multilingual machine translation is appealing because a single model can
translate into multiple languages and benefit from knowledge transfer for low
resource languages. On the other hand, massively multilingual models suffer
from the curse of multilinguality, unless scaling their size massively, which
increases their training and inference costs. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts models
are a way to drastically increase model capacity without the need for a
proportional amount of computing. The recently released NLLB-200 is an example
of such a model. It covers 202 languages but requires at least four 32GB GPUs
just for inference. In this work, we propose a pruning method that allows the
removal of up to 80\% of experts with a negligible loss in translation quality,
which makes it feasible to run the model on a single 32GB GPU. Further analysis
suggests that our pruning metrics allow to identify language-specific experts
and prune non-relevant experts for a given language pair.

<p>Emotions are an integral part of human cognition and they guide not only our
understanding of the world but also our actions within it. As such, whether we
soothe or flame an emotion is not inconsequential. Recent work in
conversational AI has focused on responding empathetically to users, validating
and soothing their emotions without a real basis. This AI-aided emotional
regulation can have negative consequences for users and society, tending
towards a one-noted happiness defined as only the absence of "negative"
emotions. We argue that we must carefully consider whether and how to respond

<p>Nowadays many research articles are prefaced with research highlights to
summarize the main findings of the paper. Highlights not only help researchers
precisely and quickly identify the contributions of a paper, they also enhance
the discoverability of the article via search engines. We aim to automatically
construct research highlights given certain segments of a research paper. We
use a pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism and a contextual
embedding layer at the input that encodes the input tokens into SciBERT
embeddings. We test our model on a benchmark dataset, CSPubSum, and also
present MixSub, a new multi-disciplinary corpus of papers for automatic
research highlight generation. For both CSPubSum and MixSub, we have observed
that the proposed model achieves the best performance compared to related
variants and other models proposed in the literature. On the CSPubSum dataset,
our model achieves the best performance when the input is only the abstract of
a paper as opposed to other segments of the paper. It produces ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2
and ROUGE-L F1-scores of 38.26, 14.26 and 35.51, respectively, METEOR score of
32.62, and BERTScore F1 of 86.65 which outperform all other baselines. On the
new MixSub dataset, where only the abstract is the input, our proposed model
(when trained on the whole training corpus without distinguishing between the
subject categories) achieves ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L F1-scores of 31.78,
9.76 and 29.3, respectively, METEOR score of 24.00, and BERTScore F1 of 85.25.

<p>Fine-tuning large models is highly effective, however, inference can be
expensive and produces carbon emissions. Knowledge distillation has been shown
to be a practical solution to reduce inference costs, but the distillation
process itself requires significant computational resources. Rather than buying
or renting GPUs to fine-tune, then distill a large model, an NLP practitioner
might instead choose to allocate the available budget to hire annotators and
manually label additional fine-tuning data. In this paper, we investigate how
to most efficiently use a fixed budget to build a compact model. Through
extensive experiments on six diverse tasks, we show that distilling from T5-XXL
(11B) to T5-Small (60M) is almost always a cost-efficient strategy compared to
annotating more data to directly train a compact model (T5-Small). We further
investigate how the optimal budget allocated towards computation varies across
scenarios. We will make our code, datasets, annotation cost estimates, and
baseline models available as a benchmark to support further work on
cost-efficient training of compact models.

<p>Language models (LMs) are pretrained on diverse data sources, including news,
discussion forums, books, and online encyclopedias. A significant portion of
this data includes opinions and perspectives which, on one hand, celebrate
democracy and diversity of ideas, and on the other hand are inherently socially
biased. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure political biases in LMs
trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the
fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We
focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically
quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data
on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that
pretrained LMs do have political leanings that reinforce the polarization
present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech
predictions and misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our
findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.

<p>This paper proposes handling training data sparsity in speech-based automatic
depression detection (SDD) using foundation models pre-trained with
self-supervised learning (SSL). An analysis of SSL representations derived from
different layers of pre-trained foundation models is first presented for SDD,
which provides insight to suitable indicator for depression detection.
Knowledge transfer is then performed from automatic speech recognition (ASR)
and emotion recognition to SDD by fine-tuning the foundation models. Results
show that the uses of oracle and ASR transcriptions yield similar SDD
performance when the hidden representations of the ASR model is incorporated
along with the ASR textual information. By integrating representations from
multiple foundation models, state-of-the-art SDD results based on real ASR were
achieved on the DAIC-WOZ dataset.

<p>In today's fast-paced world, the rates of stress and depression present a
surge. Social media provide assistance for the early detection of mental health
conditions. Existing methods mainly introduce feature extraction approaches and
train shallow machine learning classifiers. Other researches use deep neural
networks or transformers. Despite the fact that transformer-based models
achieve noticeable improvements, they cannot often capture rich factual
knowledge. Although there have been proposed a number of studies aiming to
enhance the pretrained transformer-based models with extra information or
additional modalities, no prior work has exploited these modifications for
detecting stress and depression through social media. In addition, although the
reliability of a machine learning model's confidence in its predictions is
critical for high-risk applications, there is no prior work taken into
consideration the model calibration. To resolve the above issues, we present
the first study in the task of depression and stress detection in social media,
which injects extra linguistic information in transformer-based models, namely
BERT and MentalBERT. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a Multimodal
Adaptation Gate for creating the combined embeddings, which are given as input
to a BERT (or MentalBERT) model. For taking into account the model calibration,
we apply label smoothing. We test our proposed approaches in three publicly
available datasets and demonstrate that the integration of linguistic features
into transformer-based models presents a surge in the performance. Also, the
usage of label smoothing contributes to both the improvement of the model's
performance and the calibration of the model. We finally perform a linguistic
analysis of the posts and show differences in language between stressful and
non-stressful texts, as well as depressive and non-depressive posts.

<p>The development of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has brought a
lot of attention recently. However, their evaluation in the benchmark academic
datasets remains under-explored due to the difficulty of evaluating the
generative outputs produced by this model against the ground truth. In this
paper, we aim to present a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on
diverse academic datasets, covering tasks like question-answering, text
summarization, code generation, commonsense reasoning, mathematical
problem-solving, machine translation, bias detection, and ethical
considerations. Specifically, we evaluate ChatGPT across 140 tasks and analyze
255K responses it generates in these datasets. This makes our work the largest
evaluation of ChatGPT in NLP benchmarks. In short, our study aims to validate
the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT in various tasks and provide insights
for future research using LLMs. We also report a new emergent ability to follow
multi-query instructions that we mostly found in ChatGPT and other
instruction-tuned models. Our extensive evaluation shows that even though
ChatGPT is capable of performing a wide variety of tasks, and may obtain
impressive performance in several benchmark datasets, it is still far from
achieving the ability to reliably solve many challenging tasks. By providing a
thorough assessment of ChatGPT's performance across diverse NLP tasks, this

<p>ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI. Despite its impressive
performance across various tasks, no prior work has investigated its capability
in the biomedical domain yet. To this end, this paper aims to evaluate the
performance of ChatGPT on various benchmark biomedical tasks, such as relation
extraction, document classification, question answering, and summarization. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that conducts an extensive
evaluation of ChatGPT in the biomedical domain. Interestingly, we find based on
our evaluation that in biomedical datasets that have smaller training sets,
zero-shot ChatGPT even outperforms the state-of-the-art fine-tuned generative
transformer models, such as BioGPT and BioBART. This suggests that ChatGPT's
pre-training on large text corpora makes it quite specialized even in the
biomedical domain. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT has the potential to
be a valuable tool for various tasks in the biomedical domain that lack large
annotated data.

<p>Neural sequence models based on the transformer architecture have
demonstrated remarkable \emph{in-context learning} (ICL) abilities, where they
can perform new tasks when prompted with training and test examples, without
any parameter update to the model. This work first provides a comprehensive
statistical theory for transformers to perform ICL. Concretely, we show that
transformers can implement a broad class of standard machine learning
algorithms in context, such as least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, learning
generalized linear models, and gradient descent on two-layer neural networks,
with near-optimal predictive power on various in-context data distributions.
Using an efficient implementation of in-context gradient descent as the
underlying mechanism, our transformer constructions admit mild size bounds, and
can be learned with polynomially many pretraining sequences.
</p>
<p>Building on these ``base'' ICL algorithms, intriguingly, we show that
transformers can implement more complex ICL procedures involving
\emph{in-context algorithm selection}, akin to what a statistician can do in
real life -- A \emph{single} transformer can adaptively select different base
ICL algorithms -- or even perform qualitatively different tasks -- on different
input sequences, without any explicit prompting of the right algorithm or task.
We both establish this in theory by explicit constructions, and also observe
this phenomenon experimentally. In theory, we construct two general mechanisms
for algorithm selection with concrete examples: pre-ICL testing, and post-ICL
validation. As an example, we use the post-ICL validation mechanism to
construct a transformer that can perform nearly Bayes-optimal ICL on a
challenging task -- noisy linear models with mixed noise levels.
Experimentally, we demonstrate the strong in-context algorithm selection
capabilities of standard transformer architectures.

<p>Entity-level fine-grained sentiment analysis in the financial domain is a
crucial subtask of sentiment analysis and currently faces numerous challenges.
The primary challenge stems from the lack of high-quality and large-scale
annotated corpora specifically designed for financial text sentiment analysis,
which in turn limits the availability of data necessary for developing
effective text processing techniques. Recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance in natural language
processing tasks, primarily centered around language pattern matching. In this
paper, we propose a novel and extensive Chinese fine-grained financial
sentiment analysis dataset, FinChina SA, for enterprise early warning. We
thoroughly evaluate and experiment with well-known existing open-source LLMs
using our dataset. We firmly believe that our dataset will serve as a valuable
resource to advance the exploration of real-world financial sentiment analysis
tasks, which should be the focus of future research. Our dataset and all code

our focus to singing voice conversion (SVC), thus named the challenge the
Singing Voice Conversion Challenge (SVCC). A new database was constructed for
two tasks, namely in-domain and cross-domain SVC. The challenge was run for two
months, and in total we received 26 submissions, including 2 baselines. Through
a large-scale crowd-sourced listening test, we observed that for both tasks,
although human-level naturalness was achieved by the top system, no team was
able to obtain a similarity score as high as the target speakers. Also, as
expected, cross-domain SVC is harder than in-domain SVC, especially in the
similarity aspect. We also investigated whether existing objective measurements
were able to predict perceptual performance, and found that only few of them

<p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities out of
box for a wide range of applications, yet accuracy still remains a major growth
area, especially in mission-critical domains such as biomedicine. An effective
method to calibrate the confidence level on LLM responses is essential to
automatically detect errors and facilitate human-in-the-loop verification. An
important source of calibration signals stems from expert-stipulated
programmatic supervision, which is often available at low cost but has its own
limitations such as noise and coverage. In this paper, we introduce a Pareto
optimal self-supervision framework that can leverage available programmatic
supervision to systematically calibrate LLM responses by producing a risk score
for every response, without any additional manual efforts. This is accomplished
by learning a harmonizer model to align LLM output with other available
supervision sources, which would assign higher risk scores to more uncertain
LLM responses and facilitate error correction. Experiments on standard relation
extraction tasks in biomedical and general domains demonstrate the promise of
this approach, with our proposed risk scores highly correlated with the real

based on our proposed risk scores results in significant accuracy improvement
for off-the-shelf LLMs, boosting GPT-3 results past state-of-the-art (SOTA)

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17649">Biomedical Language Models are Robust to Sub-optimal Tokenization. (arXiv:2306.17649v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gutierrez_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Bernal Jim&#xe9;nez Guti&#xe9;rrez</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Sun_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Huan Sun</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Su_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yu Su</a></p>
<p>As opposed to general English, many concepts in biomedical terminology have
been designed in recent history by biomedical professionals with the goal of
being precise and concise. This is often achieved by concatenating meaningful
biomedical morphemes to create new semantic units. Nevertheless, most modern
biomedical language models (LMs) are pre-trained using standard domain-specific
tokenizers derived from large scale biomedical corpus statistics without
explicitly leveraging the agglutinating nature of biomedical language. In this
work, we first find that standard open-domain and biomedical tokenizers are
largely unable to segment biomedical terms into meaningful components.
Therefore, we hypothesize that using a tokenizer which segments biomedical
terminology more accurately would enable biomedical LMs to improve their
performance on downstream biomedical NLP tasks, especially ones which involve
biomedical terms directly such as named entity recognition (NER) and entity
linking. Surprisingly, we find that pre-training a biomedical LM using a more
accurate biomedical tokenizer does not improve the entity representation
quality of a language model as measured by several intrinsic and extrinsic
measures such as masked language modeling prediction (MLM) accuracy as well as
NER and entity linking performance. These quantitative findings, along with a
case study which explores entity representation quality more directly, suggest
that the biomedical pre-training process is quite robust to instances of
sub-optimal tokenization.

<p>Hyperbole, or exaggeration, is a common linguistic phenomenon. The detection
of hyperbole is an important part of understanding human expression. There have
been several studies on hyperbole detection, but most of which focus on text
modality only. However, with the development of social media, people can create
hyperbolic expressions with various modalities, including text, images, videos,
etc. In this paper, we focus on multimodal hyperbole detection. We create a
multimodal detection dataset\footnote{The dataset will be released to the
community.} from Weibo (a Chinese social media) and carry out some studies on
it. We treat the text and image from a piece of weibo as two modalities and
explore the role of text and image for hyperbole detection. Different
pre-trained multimodal encoders are also evaluated on this downstream task to
show their performance. Besides, since this dataset is constructed from five
different topics, we also evaluate the cross-domain performance of different
models. These studies can serve as a benchmark and point out the direction of
further study on multimodal hyperbole detection.

<p>Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a widely used criterion for
training supervised sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. It enables learning
the relations between input and output sequences, termed alignments, by
marginalizing over perfect alignments (that yield the ground truth), at the
expense of imperfect alignments. This binary differentiation of perfect and
imperfect alignments falls short of capturing other essential alignment
properties that hold significance in other real-world applications. Here we
propose $\textit{Align With Purpose}$, a $\textbf{general Plug-and-Play
framework}$ for enhancing a desired property in models trained with the CTC
criterion. We do that by complementing the CTC with an additional loss term
that prioritizes alignments according to a desired property. Our method does
not require any intervention in the CTC loss function, enables easy
optimization of a variety of properties, and allows differentiation between
both perfect and imperfect alignments. We apply our framework in the domain of
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and show its generality in terms of property
selection, architectural choice, and scale of training dataset (up to 280,000
hours). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply it to two
unrelated properties: emission time and word error rate (WER). For the former,
we report an improvement of up to 570ms in latency optimization with a minor
reduction in WER, and for the latter, we report a relative improvement of 4.5%
WER over the baseline models. To the best of our knowledge, these applications
have never been demonstrated to work on a scale of data as large as ours.
Notably, our method can be implemented using only a few lines of code, and can
be extended to other alignment-free loss functions and to domains other than
ASR.

<p>Protoform reconstruction is the task of inferring what morphemes or words
appeared like in the ancestral languages of a set of daughter languages. Meloni
et al. (2021) achieved the state-of-the-art on Latin protoform reconstruction
with an RNN-based encoder-decoder with attention model. We update their model
with the state-of-the-art seq2seq model: the Transformer. Our model outperforms
their model on a suite of different metrics on two different datasets: their
Romance data of 8,000 cognates spanning 5 languages and a Chinese dataset (Hou
2004) of 800+ cognates spanning 39 varieties. We also probe our model for
potential phylogenetic signal contained in the model. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/cmu-llab/acl-2023.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02313">Utilizing ChatGPT Generated Data to Retrieve Depression Symptoms from Social Media. (arXiv:2307.02313v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>In this work, we present the contribution of the BLUE team in the eRisk Lab
task on searching for symptoms of depression. The task consists of retrieving
and ranking Reddit social media sentences that convey symptoms of depression
from the BDI-II questionnaire. Given that synthetic data provided by LLMs have
been proven to be a reliable method for augmenting data and fine-tuning
downstream models, we chose to generate synthetic data using ChatGPT for each
of the symptoms of the BDI-II questionnaire. We designed a prompt such that the
generated data contains more richness and semantic diversity than the BDI-II
responses for each question and, at the same time, contains emotional and
anecdotal experiences that are specific to the more intimate way of sharing
experiences on Reddit. We perform semantic search and rank the sentences'
relevance to the BDI-II symptoms by cosine similarity. We used two
state-of-the-art transformer-based models (MentalRoBERTa and a variant of
MPNet) for embedding the social media posts, the original and generated
responses of the BDI-II. Our results show that using sentence embeddings from a
model designed for semantic search outperforms the approach using embeddings
from a model pre-trained on mental health data. Furthermore, the generated
synthetic data were proved too specific for this task, the approach simply
relying on the BDI-II responses had the best performance.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02472">Deductive Additivity for Planning of Natural Language Proofs. (arXiv:2307.02472v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</a></h1>

<p>Current natural language systems designed for multi-step claim validation
typically operate in two phases: retrieve a set of relevant premise statements
using heuristics (planning), then generate novel conclusions from those
statements using a large language model (deduction). The planning step often
requires expensive Transformer operations and does not scale to arbitrary
numbers of premise statements. In this paper, we investigate whether an
efficient planning heuristic is possible via embedding spaces compatible with
deductive reasoning. Specifically, we evaluate whether embedding spaces exhibit
a property we call deductive additivity: the sum of premise statement
embeddings should be close to embeddings of conclusions based on those
premises. We explore multiple sources of off-the-shelf dense embeddings in
addition to fine-tuned embeddings from GPT3 and sparse embeddings from BM25. We
study embedding models both intrinsically, evaluating whether the property of
deductive additivity holds, and extrinsically, using them to assist planning in
natural language proof generation. Lastly, we create a dataset, Single-Step
Reasoning Contrast (SSRC), to further probe performance on various reasoning
types. Our findings suggest that while standard embedding methods frequently
embed conclusions near the sums of their premises, they fall short of being
effective heuristics and lack the ability to model certain categories of
reasoning.
