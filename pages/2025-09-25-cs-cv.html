<p><b>Authors:</b> Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the proposed system's effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Herve Goeau, Pierre Bonnet, Alexis Joly</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manyi Yao, Bingbing Zhuang, Sparsh Garg, Amit Roy-Chowdhury, Christian Shelton, Manmohan Chandraker, Abhishek Aich</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562">CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fnu Shivam, Nima Najafzadeh, Yenumula Reddy, Prashnna Gyawali</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability, addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally, we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role of image quality in machine unlearning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589">Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Menn, Feng Liang, Diana Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602">Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Neeraj Gangwar, Anshuka Rangi, Rishabh Deshmukh, Holakou Rahmanian, Yesh Dattatreya, Nickvash Kani</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads. Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Afifi, Ran Zhang, Michael S. Brown</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility, but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter, a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William L. Muckelroy III, Mohammed Alsakabi, John M. Dolan, Ozan K. Tonguz</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aravind Narayanan, Vahid Reza Khazaie, Shaina Raza</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text, but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender, race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models, with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu He, Shuai Huang, Yuwu Lu, Ming Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes, we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation bias and improve incremental learning robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Perez-Carrasco, Maya Nasr, Sebastien Roche, Chris Chan Miller, Zhan Zhang, Core Francisco Park, Eleanor Walker, Cecilia Garraffo, Douglas Finkbeiner, Ritesh Gautam, Steven Wofsy</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments. Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust, scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation hyperspectral missions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumit Mamtani</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques- Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Lo, Kelvin C. K. Chan, Wen-Huang Cheng, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent, guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless attribute transitions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Thorley, Agis Chartsias, Jordan Strom, Roberto Lang, Jeremy Slivnick, Jamie O'Driscoll, Rajan Sharma, Dipak Kotecha, Jinming Duan, Alberto Gomez</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium, which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches. We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers. Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer attention scores over the deforming myocardium.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woo-Jin Cho Kim, Jorge Oliveira, Arian Beqiri, Alex Thorley, Jordan Strom, Jamie O'Driscoll, Rajan Sharma, Jeremy Slivnick, Roberto Lang, Alberto Gomez, Agisilaos Chartsias</p>
<p>Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart, resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved from using all clips and from other benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiesi Hu, Yanwu Yang, Zhiyu Ye, Chenfei Ye, Hanyang Peng, Jianfeng Cao, Ting Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity. While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets, generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models.

<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide range of scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yu, Jianhua Yang, Zetao Du, Yan Huang, Chenglong Li, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction (LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information. Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Han, Bowen Tie, Heng Guo, Youwei Lyu, Si Li, Boxin Shi, Yunpeng Jia, Zhanyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseung Kim, Chiho Choi, Srikanth Malla, Sai Prahladh Padmanabhan, Saurabh Bagchi, Joon Hee Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize images through natural language instructions, offering considerable flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment). CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongtao Yang, Bineng Zhong, Qihua Liang, Zhiruo Zhu, Yaozong Zheng, Ning Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features. Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally, unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our method demonstrates outstanding performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhao Zhong, Shuoyang Sun, Xulin Gu, Chenyang Zhu, Bin Chen, Yaowei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures. Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19746">nnFilterMatch: A Unified Semi-Supervised Learning Framework with Uncertainty-Aware Pseudo-Label Filtering for Efficient Medical Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data. This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shao-Yu Chang, Jingyi Xu, Hieu Le, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded, per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy, temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for expressive talking head generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Zheng, Xueyuan Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances. Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves, showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code at: https://github.com/dfr-code/ExpFace.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyang Chen, Shuzhao Li, Xiuwen Zhu, Yongfan Chen, Fan Yang, Cheng Fang, Lin Qu, Xiaoxiao Xu, Hu Wei, Minggang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of 1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse document analysis scenarios.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19778">Sex-based Bias Inherent in the Dice Similarity Coefficient: A Model Independent Analysis for Multiple Anatomical Structures</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hartmut H\"antze, Myrthe Buser, Alessa Hering, Lisa C. Adams, Keno K. Bressem</p>
<p>Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men. While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets, no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself. This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures, average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around 0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected, with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and fair evaluations in medical image analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19779">EfficienT-HDR: An Efficient Transformer-Based Framework via Multi-Exposure Fusion for HDR Reconstruction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Shen Huang, Tzu-Han Chen, Cheng-Yen Hsiao, Shaou-Gang Miaou</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision, as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts, hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and practicality across various dynamic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixun Zhang, Feng Zhou, Jianqin Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation (EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shantanusinh Parmar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR) domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical image enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchuan Mao, Zhi Gao, Xiaomeng Fan, Yuwei Wu, Yunde Jia, Chenchen Jing</p>
<p>Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks. Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs. We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex, long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions, potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%, significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emi Giraud, Rodrigo Borba Pinheiro, Yannick Berthoumieu</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide 360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space, addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure. Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based applications on 360o images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pin-Jui Huang, Yu-Hsuan Liao, SooHeon Kim, NoSeong Park, JongBae Park, DongMyung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However, extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP) methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation, enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangxue Yu, Hui Wang, San Jiang, Xing Zhang, Dejin Zhang, Qingquan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in 3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based scene rendering.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce CapStARE, a capsule-based spatio-temporal architecture for gaze estimation that integrates a ConvNeXt backbone, capsule formation with attention routing, and dual GRU decoders specialized for slow and rapid gaze dynamics. This modular design enables efficient part-whole reasoning and disentangled temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ETH-XGaze (3.36) and MPIIFaceGaze (2.65) while maintaining real-time inference (< 10 ms). The model also generalizes well to unconstrained conditions in Gaze360 (9.06) and human-robot interaction scenarios in RT-GENE (4.76), outperforming or matching existing methods with fewer parameters and greater interpretability. These results demonstrate that CapStARE offers a practical and robust solution for real-time gaze estimation in interactive systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guo Chen, Jiarun Liu, Sicong Du, Chenming Wu, Deqi Li, Shi-Sheng Huang, Guofeng Zhang, Sheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting. Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and, subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in 3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability. Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 3D inpainting strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edmund Bu, Yossi Gandelsman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic, represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second, we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarmistha Das, R E Zera Marveen Lyngkhoi, Kirtan Jain, Vinayak Goyal, Sriparna Saha, Manish Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining, articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a 5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users' need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions, also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks (pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score, among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to provide a platform for users to express complaints through video.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phyo Thet Yee, Dimitrios Kollias, Sudeepta Mishra, Abhinav Dhall</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest, particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M) module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally, SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model (LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Liu, Hongliang Lu, Haichao Liu, Haipeng Liu, Xin Liu, Ruoyu Yao, Shengbo Eben Li, Jun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability, however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then, harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation, we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhao Ji, Chaohui Yu, Junyao Gao, Fan Wang, Cairong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development, offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue, we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection. SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations, thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment, we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of 0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation for the further development of automatic harvest robots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifang Zhang, Jiahan Zhang, Shengjie Zhou, Qi Wei, Shuo He, Feng Liu, Lei Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs) exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nico Schulthess, Ender Konukoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection.

<p>Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuekang Zhu, Ji-Zhe Zhou, Kaiwen Feng, Chenfan Qu, Yunfei Wang, Liting Zhou, Jian liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps. This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manahil Raza, Ayesha Azam, Talha Qaiser, Nasir Rajpoot</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes). Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.</p>

Uncontrolled user captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates, creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Zheng, Jianhui Feng, Tianran Li, Marius Staring, Yuchuan Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features (that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods, with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20091">Unleashing the Potential of the Semantic Latent Space in Diffusion Models for Image Dehazing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizheng Yang, Hu Yu, Bing Li, Jinghao Zhang, Jie Huang, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight, we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance to existing image dehazing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> JuanaJuana Valeria Hurtado, Rohit Mohan, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods. We make the code available at https://hyperspectraladapter.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Belal Shoer, Yova Kementchedjhieva</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image" format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13 languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botai Yuan, Yutian Zhou, Yingjie Wang, Fushuo Huo, Yongcheng Jing, Li Shen, Ying Wei, Zhiqi Shen, Ziwei Liu, Tianwei Zhang, Jie Yang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy -- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98% sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95% sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type, department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions (negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanish Suwal, Shaurya Garg, Dipkamal Bhusal, Michael Clifford, Nidhi Rastogi</p>
<p>Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems, where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety. Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions. This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Cen, Zhenfeng Zhuang, Yuzhe Zhang, Min Zeng, Baptiste Magnier, Lequan Yu, Hong Zhang, Liansheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Qin Tan, Xiatian Zhu, Owen Addison, Yunpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patricia Sch\"ontag, David Nakath, Judith Fischer, R\"udiger R\"ottgers, Kevin K\"oser</p>
<p>Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled, ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges, such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes, using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance. Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks, including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code will be made available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196">Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dehong Kong, Sifan Yu, Siyuan Liang, Jiawei Liang, Jianhou Gan, Aishan Liu, Wenqi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Khater, Mona Strauss, Philipp von Olshausen, Alexander Reiterer</p>
<p>Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations. Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure, allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse, point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Burgert, Oliver Stoll, Paolo Rota, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance towards texture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kwang-Hyun Uhm, Hyunjun Cho, Sung-Hoo Hong, Seung-Won Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however, the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume. Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<p>Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising. This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

<p>Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization, we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then, supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including 68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2, respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research. However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab", a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information. The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods. Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haruka Kumagai, Leslie W\"ohler, Satoshi Ikehata, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based face classification tasks over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xichen Xu, Yanshu Wang, Jinbao Wang, Xiaoning Lei, Guoyang Xie, Guannan Jiang, Zhichao Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NeurIPS-938.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishal Adhikari, Jiajia Li, Eric S. Michel, Jacob Dykes, Te-Ming Paul Tseng, Mary Love Tagert, Dong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S., highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer, derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and computational efficiency (FPS > 30).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Li, Shuwen Qiu, Julien Han, Xingzi Xu, Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu, Kee Kiat Koo, Karim Bouyarmane</p>
<p>Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON) technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Wang, Chuhao Chen, Yiming Huang, Zhiyang Dou, Yuan Liu, Jiatao Gu, Lingjie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic, sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic, physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains. While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge.

Our final ensemble combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 72.3% (ET), 95.6% (NET), 68.9% (CC), 89.5% (ED), 92.3% (TC), and 92.3% (WT), respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Saviolo, Jeffrey Mao, Giuseppe Loianno</p>
<p>Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where global methods fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Chen, I-Chun Arthur Liu, Gaurav Sukhatme, Daniel Seita</p>
<p>Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sacha Morin, Kumaraditya Gupta, Mahtab Sandhu, Charlie Gauthier, Francesco Argenziano, Kirsty Ellis, Liam Paull</p>
<p>Abstract: Executing open-ended natural language queries is a core problem in robotics. While recent advances in imitation learning and vision-language-actions models (VLAs) have enabled promising end-to-end policies, these models struggle when faced with complex instructions and new scenes. An alternative is to design an explicit scene representation as a queryable interface between the robot and the world, using query results to guide downstream motion planning. In this work, we present Agentic Scene Policies (ASP), an agentic framework that leverages the advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying capabilities of modern scene representations to implement a capable language-conditioned robot policy. ASP can execute open-vocabulary queries in a zero-shot manner by explicitly reasoning about object affordances in the case of more complex skills. Through extensive experiments, we compare ASP with VLAs on tabletop manipulation problems and showcase how ASP can tackle room-level queries through affordance-guided navigation, and a scaled-up scene representation.

<p>Abstract: The embodiment of emotional reactions from body parts contains rich information about our affective experiences. We propose a framework that utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to generate Embodied LVLM Emotion Narratives (ELENA). These are well-defined, multi-layered text outputs, primarily comprising descriptions that focus on the salient body parts involved in emotional reactions. We also employ attention maps and observe that contemporary models exhibit a persistent bias towards the facial region. Despite this limitation, we observe that our employed framework can effectively recognize embodied emotions in face-masked images, outperforming baselines without any fine-tuning. ELENA opens a new trajectory for embodied emotion analysis across the modality of vision and enriches modeling in an affect-aware setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and additional information can be found at https://ego-bridge.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> MohammadReza EskandariNasab, Shah Muhammad Hamdi, Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection, where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunlun Xu, Yibo Feng, Jiangmeng Li, Yongsheng Qi, Jiahuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts, intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<p>Abstract: Accurate text recognition for historical documents can greatly advance the study and preservation of cultural heritage. Existing vision-language models (VLMs), however, are designed for modern, standardized texts and are not equipped to read the diverse languages and scripts, irregular layouts, and frequent degradation found in historical materials.
  This paper presents CHURRO, a 3B-parameter open-weight VLM specialized for historical text recognition. The model is trained on CHURRO-DS, the largest historical text recognition dataset to date. CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical corpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage across 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages.
  We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character recognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all other VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and 70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the second-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being 15.5 times more cost-effective.
  By releasing the model and dataset, we aim to enable community-driven research to improve the readability of historical texts and accelerate scholarship.</p>

To address this gap, we propose Amputated Joint Aware 3D Human Mesh Recovery (AJAHR), which is an adaptive pose estimation framework that improves mesh reconstruction for individuals with limb loss. Our model integrates a body-part amputation classifier, jointly trained with the mesh recovery network, to detect potential amputations.

While maintaining competitive performance on non-amputees, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for amputated individuals. Additional materials can be found at the project webpage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling artist-designed meshes to high triangle numbers remains challenging for autoregressive generative models. Existing transformer-based methods suffer from long-sequence bottlenecks and limited quantization resolution, primarily due to the large number of tokens required and constrained quantization granularity. These issues prevent faithful reproduction of fine geometric details and structured density patterns. We introduce MeshMosaic, a novel local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K triangles--substantially surpassing prior methods, which typically handle only around 8K faces. MeshMosaic first segments shapes into patches, generating each patch autoregressively and leveraging shared boundary conditions to promote coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions. This strategy enhances scalability to high-resolution meshes by quantizing patches individually, resulting in more symmetrical and organized mesh density and structure. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets demonstrate that MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometric fidelity and user preference, supporting superior detail representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications.</p>

Second, foundational training lacks quantitative preference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a result, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered multi-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a novel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference optimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining (AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our contributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive AVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture. SF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic features of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we integrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference Optimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and prioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality. Experiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. The complete code and dataset will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Babak Naderi, Ross Cutler</p>
<p>Abstract: Subjective video quality assessment (VQA) is the gold standard for measuring end-user experience across communication, streaming, and UGC pipelines. Beyond high-validity lab studies, crowdsourcing offers accurate, reliable, faster, and cheaper evaluation-but suffers from unreliable submissions by workers who ignore instructions or game rewards. Recent tests reveal sophisticated exploits of video metadata and rising use of remote-desktop (RD) connections, both of which bias results. We propose objective and subjective detectors for RD users and compare two mainstream crowdsourcing platforms on their susceptibility and mitigation under realistic test conditions and task designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Li, Rodrigo Santa Cruz, Mingze Xi, Hu Zhang, Madhawa Perera, Ziwei Wang, Ahalya Ravendran, Brandon J. Matthews, Feng Xu, Matt Adcock, Dadong Wang, Jiajun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform complex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene understanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a meaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric structure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we introduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework built on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations: (1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured, scalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design, the framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic queryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting object-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The retrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream execution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning scenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the indoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate of a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for emergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to facilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning, effectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task planning in complex 3D environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Lyu, Junchuan Zhao, Ye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven facial animation has made significant progress in multimedia applications, with diffusion models showing strong potential for talking-face synthesis. However, most existing works treat speech features as a monolithic representation and fail to capture their fine-grained roles in driving different facial motions, while also overlooking the importance of modeling keyframes with intense dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KSDiff, a Keyframe-Augmented Speech-Aware Dual-Path Diffusion framework. Specifically, the raw audio and transcript are processed by a Dual-Path Speech Encoder (DPSE) to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related features, while an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning (KEL) module predicts the most salient motion frames. These components are integrated into a Dual-path Motion generator to synthesize coherent and realistic facial motions. Extensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb demonstrate that KSDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in both lip synchronization accuracy and head-pose naturalness. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for talking-head generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Manzour, Catherine M. Elias, Omar M. Shehata, Rub\'en Izquierdo, Miguel \'Angel Sotelo</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Cardoni, Sam Leroux</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofeng Yin, Yanjie Ze, Hong-Xing Yu, C. Karen Liu, Jiajun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics. VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at: https://visualmimic.github.io .</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emi Giraud, Vinh-Thong Ta, Nicolas Papadakis, Jos\'e V. Manj\'on, D. Louis Collins, Pierrick Coup\'e, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods are important tools for quantitative analysis of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Recently, patch-based label fusion approaches have demonstrated state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new patch-based label fusion framework to perform segmentation of anatomical structures. The proposed approach uses an Optimized PAtchMatch Label fusion (OPAL) strategy that drastically reduces the computation time required for the search of similar patches. The reduced computation time of OPAL opens the way for new strategies and facilitates processing on large databases. In this paper, we investigate new perspectives offered by OPAL, by introducing a new multi-scale and multi-feature framework. During our validation on hippocampus segmentation we use two datasets: young adults in the ICBM cohort and elderly adults in the EADC-ADNI dataset. For both, OPAL is compared to state-of-the-art methods. Results show that OPAL obtained the highest median Dice coefficient (89.9% for ICBM and 90.1% for EADC-ADNI). Moreover, in both cases, OPAL produced a segmentation accuracy similar to inter-expert variability. On the EADC-ADNI dataset, we compare the hippocampal volumes obtained by manual and automatic segmentation. The volumes appear to be highly correlated that enables to perform more accurate separation of pathological populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emi Giraud, Vinh-Thong Ta, Nicolas Papadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Superpixel decomposition methods are widely used in computer vision and image processing applications. By grouping homogeneous pixels, the accuracy can be increased and the decrease of the number of elements to process can drastically reduce the computational burden. For most superpixel methods, a trade-off is computed between 1) color homogeneity, 2) adherence to the image contours and 3) shape regularity of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a framework that jointly enforces all these aspects and provides accurate and regular Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP). During the decomposition, we propose to consider color features along the linear path between the pixel and the corresponding superpixel barycenter. A contour prior is also used to prevent the crossing of image boundaries when associating a pixel to a superpixel. Finally, in order to improve the decomposition accuracy and the robustness to noise, we propose to integrate the pixel neighborhood information, while preserving the same computational complexity. SCALP is extensively evaluated on standard segmentation dataset, and the obtained results outperform the ones of the state-of-the-art methods. SCALP is also extended for supervoxel decomposition on MRI images.</p>

In this paper, we propose a new Nearest Neighbor-based Superpixel Clustering (NNSC) method to generate texture-aware superpixels in a limited computational time compared to previous approaches. We introduce a new clustering framework using patch-based nearest neighbor matching, while most existing methods are based on a pixel-wise K-means clustering. Therefore, we directly group pixels in the patch space enabling to capture texture information. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method with favorable comparison in terms of segmentation performances on both standard color and texture datasets. We also show the computational efficiency of NNSC compared to recent texture-aware superpixel methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emi Giraud, Merlin Boyer, Micha\"el Cl\'ement</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-segmentation into superpixels is a very effective dimensionality reduction strategy, enabling fast dense image processing. The main issue of this approach is the inherent irregularity of the image decomposition compared to standard hierarchical multi-resolution schemes, especially when searching for similar neighboring patterns. Several works have attempted to overcome this issue by taking into account the region irregularity into their comparison model. Nevertheless, they remain sub-optimal to provide robust and accurate superpixel neighborhood descriptors, since they only compute features within each region, poorly capturing contour information at superpixel borders. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing the dual superpatch, a novel superpixel neighborhood descriptor. This structure contains features computed in reduced superpixel regions, as well as at the interfaces of multiple superpixels to explicitly capture contour structure information. A fast multi-scale non-local matching framework is also introduced for the search of similar descriptors at different resolution levels in an image dataset. The proposed dual superpatch enables to more accurately capture similar structured patterns at different scales, and we demonstrate the robustness and performance of this new strategy on matching and supervised labeling applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation is useful for gaming, the film industry, and AR/VR applications. However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made them attractive for application to video understanding, utilizing video tokens as contextual input. However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question (query) and a long video, our model identifies and selects the most relevant K video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Our experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohee Kim, Jisu Kang, Dunam Kim, Seokju Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Qiao, Zhexiao Xiong, Xinge Zhu, Yuexin Ma, Qiumeng He, Nathan Jacobs</p>
<p>Abstract: Omnidirectional depth estimation presents a significant challenge due to the inherent distortions in panoramic images. Despite notable advancements, the impact of projection methods remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Cylindrical Panoramic Depth Estimation (MCPDepth), a novel two-stage framework designed to enhance omnidirectional depth estimation through stereo matching across multiple cylindrical panoramas. MCPDepth initially performs stereo matching using cylindrical panoramas, followed by a robust fusion of the resulting depth maps from different views. Unlike existing methods that rely on customized kernels to address distortions, MCPDepth utilizes standard network components, facilitating seamless deployment on embedded devices while delivering exceptional performance. To effectively address vertical distortions in cylindrical panoramas, MCPDepth incorporates a circular attention module, significantly expanding the receptive field beyond traditional convolutions. We provide a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of common panoramic projections-spherical, cylindrical, and cubic-demonstrating the superior efficacy of cylindrical projection. Our method improves the mean absolute error (MAE) by 18.8% on the outdoor dataset Deep360 and by 19.9% on the real dataset 3D60. This work offers practical insights for other tasks and real-world applications, establishing a new paradigm in omnidirectional depth estimation.

PPT incorporates increased patch tokens and trainable positional encoding while keeping most pre-trained model parameters frozen. Extensive experiments validate that PPT is both effective and efficient.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Yang, Zikai Huang, Chenshu Xu, Shengfeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term motion generation is a challenging task that requires producing coherent and realistic sequences over extended durations. Current methods primarily rely on framewise motion representations, which capture only static spatial details and overlook temporal dynamics. This approach leads to significant redundancy across the temporal dimension, complicating the generation of effective long-term motion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the novel concept of Lagrangian Motion Fields, specifically designed for long-term motion generation. By treating each joint as a Lagrangian particle with uniform velocity over short intervals, our approach condenses motion representations into a series of "supermotions" (analogous to superpixels). This method seamlessly integrates static spatial information with interpretable temporal dynamics, transcending the limitations of existing network architectures and motion sequence content types. Our solution is versatile and lightweight, eliminating the need for neural network preprocessing. Our approach excels in tasks such as long-term music-to-dance generation and text-to-motion generation, offering enhanced efficiency, superior generation quality, and greater diversity compared to existing methods. Additionally, the adaptability of Lagrangian Motion Fields extends to applications like infinite motion looping and fine-grained controlled motion generation, highlighting its broad utility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liang, Shweta Bhardwaj, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit continual learning~(CL), which enables pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) to sequentially fine-tune on new downstream tasks over time. However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a more serious challenge. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. Additionally, we propose a scheme to predict task identity with confidence and calibrate the model's outputs accordingly. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and computation efficiency in training over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Kang, Hui Li, Tianyang Xu, Xiao-Jun Wu, Rui Wang, Chunyang Cheng, Josef Kittler</p>
<p>Abstract: Euclidean representation learning methods have achieved promising results in image fusion tasks, which can be attributed to their clear advantages in handling with linear space. However, data collected from a realistic scene usually has a non-Euclidean structure, evaluating the consistency of latent representations from paired views using Euclidean distance raises challenges. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SMLNet, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. The SPD matrix fundamentally underpins our network's learning process. Building upon this mathematical foundation, we employ a cross-modal fusion strategy to exploit modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. To capture semantic similarity in images' intrinsic space, we further develop an attention module that meticulously processes the cross-modal semantic affinity matrix. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Shaoyun2023.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Yang, Pengxiang Li, Lu Zhang, Liqian Ma, Ping Hu, Siyu Du, Yunzhi Zhuge, Xu Jia, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Subject-driven image inpainting has recently gained prominence in image editing with the rapid advancement of diffusion models. Beyond image guidance, recent studies have explored incorporating text guidance to achieve identity-preserved yet locally editable object inpainting. However, these methods still suffer from identity overfitting, where original attributes remain entangled with target textual instructions. To overcome this limitation, we propose DreamMix, a diffusion-based framework adept at inserting target objects into user-specified regions while concurrently enabling arbitrary text-driven attribute modifications. DreamMix introduces three key components: (i) an Attribute Decoupling Mechanism (ADM) that synthesizes diverse attribute-augmented image-text pairs to mitigate overfitting; (ii) a Textual Attribute Substitution (TAS) module that isolates target attributes via orthogonal decomposition, and (iii) a Disentangled Inpainting Framework (DIF) that seperates local generation from global harmonization. Extensive experiments across multiple inpainting backbones demonstrate that DreamMix achieves a superior balance between identity preservation and attribute editability across diverse applications, including object insertion, attribute editing, and small object inpainting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Wolters, Johannes Gilg, Torben Teepe, Fabian Herzog, Felix Fent, Gerhard Rigoll</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present SpaRC, a novel Sparse fusion transformer for 3D perception that integrates multi-view image semantics with Radar and Camera point features. The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/phi-wol/sparc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Yin, Qiang Zhang, Richard Zhang, William T. Freeman, Fredo Durand, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkai Chen, Zhijie Deng, Kening Zheng, Yibo Yan, Shuliang Liu, PeiJun Wu, Peijie Jiang, Jia Liu, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runyi Li, Xuanyu Zhang, Chuhan Tong, Zhipei Xu, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC technologies, the modalities generated by models have expanded from images and videos to 3D objects, leading to an increasing number of works focused on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) generative models. Existing research on copyright protection for generative models has primarily concentrated on watermarking in image and text modalities, with little exploration into the copyright protection of 3D object generative models. In this paper, we propose the first bit watermarking framework for 3DGS generative models, named GaussianSeal, to enable the decoding of bits as copyright identifiers from the rendered outputs of generated 3DGS. By incorporating adaptive bit modulation modules into the generative model and embedding them into the network blocks in an adaptive way, we achieve high-precision bit decoding with minimal training overhead while maintaining the fidelity of the model's outputs. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms post-processing watermarking approaches for 3DGS objects, achieving superior performance of watermark decoding accuracy and preserving the quality of the generated results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchi Feng, Giles Hamilton-Fletcher, Nikhil Ballem, Michael Batavia, Yifei Wang, Jiuling Zhong, Maurizio Porfiri, John-Ross Rizzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Navigating urban environments poses significant challenges for individuals who are blind or have low vision, especially in areas affected by construction. Construction zones introduce hazards such as uneven surfaces, barriers, hazardous materials, excessive noise, and altered routes that obstruct familiar paths and compromise safety. Although navigation tools assist in trip planning, they often overlook these temporary obstacles. Existing hazard detection systems also struggle with the visual variability of construction sites. Methods: We developed a computer vision--based assistive system integrating three modules: an open-vocabulary object detector to identify diverse construction-related elements, a YOLO-based model specialized in detecting scaffolding and poles, and an optical character recognition module to interpret construction signage. Results: In static testing at seven construction sites using images from multiple stationary viewpoints, the system achieved 88.56% overall accuracy. It consistently identified relevant objects within 2--10 meters and at approach angles up to 75$^{\circ}$. At 2--4 meters, detection was perfect (100%) across all angles. Even at 10 meters, six of seven sites remained detectable within a 15$^{\circ}$ approach. In dynamic testing along a 0.5-mile urban route containing eight construction sites, the system analyzed every frame of a first-person walking video. It achieved 87.26% accuracy in distinguishing construction from non-construction areas, rising to 92.0% with a 50-frame majority vote filter. Conclusion: The system can reliably detect construction sites in real time and at sufficient distances to provide advance warnings, enabling individuals with visual impairments to make safer mobility decisions such as proceeding with caution or rerouting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Zhang, Siyuan Liang, Yaning Tan, Zhaowei Chen, Linze Li, Ge Wu, Yuhao Chen, Shuheng Li, Zhenyu Zhao, Caihua Chen, Jiajun Liang, Yao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) struggle to generate images at resolutions higher than their training resolutions. The primary obstacle is that the explicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolating to unseen positions which degrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In this paper, We propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer~(LEDiT) to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no explicit PEs, thereby avoiding PE extrapolation. The key innovation of LEDiT lies in the use of causal attention. We demonstrate that causal attention can implicitly encode global positional information and show that such information facilitates extrapolation. We further introduce a locality enhancement module, which captures fine-grained local information to complement the global coarse-grained position information encoded by causal attention. Experimental results on both conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that LEDiT supports up to 4x resolution scaling (e.g., from 256x256 to 512x512), achieving better image quality compared to the state-of-the-art length extrapolation methods. We believe that LEDiT marks a departure from the standard RoPE-based methods and offers a promising insight into length extrapolation. Project page: https://shenzhang2145.github.io/ledit/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \"Omer Veysel \c{C}a\u{g}atan, \"Omer Faruk Tal, M. Emre G\"ursoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced significantly in visual representation learning, yet comprehensive evaluations of its adversarial robustness remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of seven discriminative self-supervised models and one supervised model across diverse tasks, including ImageNet classification, transfer learning, segmentation, and detection. Our findings suggest that discriminative SSL models generally exhibit better robustness to adversarial attacks compared to their supervised counterpart on ImageNet, with this advantage extending to transfer learning when using linear evaluation. However, when fine-tuning is applied, the robustness gap between SSL and supervised models narrows considerably. Similarly, this robustness advantage diminishes in segmentation and detection tasks. We also investigate how various factors might influence adversarial robustness, including architectural choices, training duration, data augmentations, and batch sizes. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing exploration of adversarial robustness in visual self-supervised representation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies and wearable devices, egocentric vision understanding has emerged as a new and challenging research direction, gradually attracting widespread attention from both academia and industry. Egocentric vision captures visual and multimodal data through cameras or sensors worn on the human body, offering a unique perspective that simulates human visual experiences. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the research on egocentric vision understanding, systematically analyzing the components of egocentric scenes and categorizing the tasks into four main areas: subject understanding, object understanding, environment understanding, and hybrid understanding. We explore in detail the sub-tasks within each category. We also summarize the main challenges and trends currently existing in the field. Furthermore, this paper presents an overview of high-quality egocentric vision datasets, offering valuable resources for future research. By summarizing the latest advancements, we anticipate the broad applications of egocentric vision technologies in fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence, and propose future research directions based on the latest developments in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhang, Minfu Li, Lu Li, Daoyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Single underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a challenging ill-posed problem, but its development is hindered by two major issues: (1) The labels in underwater reference datasets are pseudo labels, relying on these pseudo ground truths in supervised learning leads to domain discrepancy. (2) Underwater reference datasets are scarce, making training on such small datasets prone to overfitting and distribution shift. To address these challenges, we propose Trans-UIE, a transfer learning-based UIE model that captures the fundamental paradigms of UIE through pretraining and utilizes a dataset composed of both reference and non-reference datasets for fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning the model using only reconstruction loss may introduce confirmation bias. To mitigate this, our method leverages no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics from above-water scenes to guide the transfer learning process across domains while generating enhanced images with the style of the above-water image domain. Additionally, to reduce the risk of overfitting during the pretraining stage, we introduce Pearson correlation loss. Experimental results on both full-reference and no-reference underwater benchmark datasets demonstrate that Trans-UIE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangxiao Lu, Ruosen Li, Liqiang Jing, Jikai Wang, Xinya Du, Yunhui Guo, Nicholas Ruozzi, Yu Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding focuses on detecting objects from images based on language expressions. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced visual grounding performance by training large models with large-scale datasets. However, the problem remains challenging, especially when similar objects appear in the input image. For example, an LVLM may not be able to differentiate Diet Coke and regular Coke in an image. In this case, if additional reference images of Diet Coke and regular Coke are available, it can help the visual grounding of similar objects.
  In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding (MRVG). In this task, a model has access to a set of reference images of objects in a database. Based on these reference images and a language expression, the model is required to detect a target object from a query image. We first introduce a new dataset to study the MRVG problem. Then we introduce a novel method, named MRVG-Net, to solve this visual grounding problem. We show that by efficiently using reference images with few-shot object detection and using Large Language Models (LLMs) for object matching, our method achieves superior visual grounding performance compared to the state-of-the-art LVLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Our approach bridges the gap between few-shot detection and visual grounding, unlocking new capabilities for visual understanding, which has wide applications in robotics.

<p>Abstract: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjing Liu, Zhiyong Wang, Xinyu Fan, Amirhossein Dadashzadeh, Honghai Liu, Majid Mirmehdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing 3D human pose estimation methods often suffer in performance, when applied to cross-scenario inference, due to domain shifts in characteristics such as camera viewpoint, position, posture, and body size. Among these factors, camera viewpoints and locations have been shown to contribute significantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human poses. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts global transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems of source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module that is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D poses. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered coordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the positional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent spatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is incorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process is iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance for domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset benchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to explain complex information from chart images is vital for effective data-driven decision-making. In this work, we address the challenge of generating detailed explanations alongside answering questions about charts. We present ChartQA-X, a comprehensive dataset comprising 30,299 chart samples across four chart types, each paired with contextually relevant questions, answers, and explanations. Explanations are generated and selected based on metrics such as faithfulness, informativeness, coherence, and perplexity. Our human evaluation with 245 participants shows that model-generated explanations in ChartQA-X surpass human-written explanations in accuracy and logic and are comparable in terms of clarity and overall quality. Moreover, models fine-tuned on ChartQA-X show substantial improvements across various metrics, including absolute gains of up to 24.57 points in explanation quality, 18.96 percentage points in question-answering accuracy, and 14.75 percentage points on unseen benchmarks for the same task. By integrating explanatory narratives with answers, our approach enables agents to convey complex visual information more effectively, improving comprehension and greater trust in the generated responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giyeong Oh, Woohyun Cho, Siyeol Kim, Suhwan Choi, Younjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martha Teiko Teye, Ori Maoz, Matthias Rottmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking from LiDAR point clouds presents unique challenges due to the sparse and irregular nature of the data, compounded by the need for temporal coherence across frames. Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.724 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most metrics. We introduce Redemption Score(RS), a novel hybrid framework that ranks image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment, (2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual grounding, and (3) LLM Text Embeddings for contextual text similarity against human references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows RS to offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, RS achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 58.42, outperforming most prior methods and demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced evaluation by thoroughly examining both the visual accuracy and text quality together, with consistent performance across Conceptual Captions and MS COCO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yang, Haocheng Xi, Yilong Zhao, Muyang Li, Jintao Zhang, Han Cai, Yujun Lin, Xiuyu Li, Chenfeng Xu, Kelly Peng, Jianfei Chen, Song Han, Kurt Keutzer, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyuan Liu, Boyun Zheng, Wenting Chen, Zhihao Peng, Zhenfei Yin, Jing Shao, Jiancong Hu, Yixuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks, and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition, lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios. We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity. EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Dong, Moru Liu, Jian Liang, Eleni Chatzi, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luigi Sigillo, Shengfeng He, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight training framework that significantly improves detail and texture fidelity in ultra-high-resolution (2K-4K) image synthesis. LWD introduces a novel, frequency-aware masking strategy derived from wavelet energy maps, which dynamically focuses the training process on detail-rich regions of the latent space. This is complemented by a scale-consistent VAE objective to ensure high spectral fidelity. The primary advantage of our approach is its efficiency: LWD requires no architectural modifications and adds zero additional cost during inference, making it a practical solution for scaling existing models. Across multiple strong baselines, LWD consistently improves perceptual quality and FID scores, demonstrating the power of signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient path toward high-resolution generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreu Girbau-Xalabarder, Jun Nagata, Shinichi Sumiyoshi, Ricard Marsal, Shin'ichi Satoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis, enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this, prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead, we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining performance under event-budget constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengdi Jia, Zekun Qi, Shaochen Zhang, Wenyao Zhang, Xinqiang Yu, Jiawei He, He Wang, Li Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks cover only the most elementary layer of spatial reasoning and are largely approaching saturation in the latest reasoning models. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through careful manual annotation, we construct over 8.4K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial reasoning. We also explore two strategies-PointGraph (explicit scene graph cues) and SpatialCoT (novel-view chain-of-thought)-to bolster spatial reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamzeh Asgharnezhad, Pegah Tabarisaadi, Abbas Khosravi, Roohallah Alizadehsani, U. Rajendra Acharya</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate skin cancer diagnosis is vital for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, yet challenges remain due to data scarcity and limited uncertainty awareness. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification with transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. We benchmark several pre-trained feature extractors -- including CLIP variants, ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, and EfficientNet-V2-Large -- combined with traditional classifiers such as SVM, XGBoost, and logistic regression. Multiple principal component analysis (PCA) settings (64, 128, 256, 512) are explored, with LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/14 at PCA-256 achieving the strongest baseline results. In the UQ phase, Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) are applied and evaluated using uncertainty-aware metrics (UAcc, USen, USpe, UPre). Ensemble methods with PCA-256 provide the best balance between accuracy and reliability. Further improvements are obtained through feature fusion of top-performing extractors at PCA-256. Finally, we propose a feature-fusion based model trained with a predictive entropy (PE) loss function, which outperforms all prior configurations across both standard and uncertainty-aware evaluations, advancing trustworthy DL-based skin cancer diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anju Chhetri, Jari Korhonen, Prashnna Gyawali, Binod Bhattarai</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is critical for surgical training and robotic decision-making in robot-assisted surgery. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great potential for advancing scene perception in the medical domain, facilitating surgeons to understand surgical scenes and procedures. However, these methods are primarily oriented towards image-based analysis or global video understanding, overlooking the fine-grained video reasoning that is crucial for analyzing specific processes and capturing detailed task execution within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K that is a large-scale dataset with over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Building on this resource, SurgVidLM incorporates a two-stage StageFocus mechanism: the first stage extracts global procedural context, while the second stage performs high-frequency local analysis guided by temporal cues. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low- and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the preservation of critical task-specific details. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs of comparable parameter scale in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing the context of complex robot-assisted surgeries. Our code and dataset will be publicly accessible soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuoye Xiong, Anqi Dong, Ning Wang, Cong Hua, Guangming Zhu, Lin Mei, Peiyi Shen, Liang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning, most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU). CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined (removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft, and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum increase in average accuracy across 1.03%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Rege Cambrin, Lorenzo Vaiani, Giuseppe Gallipoli, Luca Cagliero, Paolo Garza</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However, most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining), a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC@1000 by 54% over existing models. Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Miele, Niklas Linde</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhui Qiang, Zhaoyang Wei, Xumeng Han, Zipeng Wang, Siyao Li, Xiangyuan Lan, Jianbin Jiao, Zhenjun Han</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks, which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues, often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction, integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like analysis.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan-Hanh Pham, Chris Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning, and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Cao, Yanjie Li, Kaisheng Liang, Bin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises safety concerns, as adversaries may exploit model vulnerabilities to induce harmful outputs, with targeted black-box adversarial attacks posing a particularly severe threat. However, existing methods primarily maximize encoder-level global similarity, which lacks the granularity for stealthy and practical fine-grained attacks, where only specific target should be altered (e.g., modifying a car while preserving its background). Moreover, they largely neglect the projector, a key semantic bridge in VLMs for multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a novel black-box targeted attack framework that leverages the projector. Specifically, we utilize the widely adopted Querying Transformer (Q-Former) which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained query outputs, to enhance attack effectiveness and granularity. For standard global targeted attack scenarios, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), which aligns Q-Former fine-grained query outputs with the target to enhance attack strength and exploits the intermediate pretrained Q-Former that is not fine-tuned for any specific Large Language Model (LLM) to improve attack transferability. For fine-grained attack scenarios, we augment IPGA with the Residual Query Alignment (RQA) module, which preserves unrelated content by constraining non-target query outputs to enhance attack granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IPGA significantly outperforms baselines in global targeted attacks, and IPGA with RQA (IPGA-R) attains superior success rates and unrelated content preservation over baselines in fine-grained attacks. Our method also transfers effectively to commercial VLMs such as Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p>

The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piyush Bagad, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Kashyap Naveen, Bhuvanesh Singla, Raajan Wankhade, Shreesha M, Ramu S, Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations. Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU. The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

<p>Abstract: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan Pan, Kaiyu Guo, Dongli Xu, Zhaorui Tan, Chen Jiang, Deshu Chen, Xin Guo, Brian C. Lovell, Limei Han, Yuan Cheng, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh</p>
<p>Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios. Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Wang, Jiayi Zhang, Tianwei Guan, Yuhan Zhou, Xingyuan Li, Minjing Dong, Jinyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images. In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images, thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both inference speed and fusion quality.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16738">Mixture of Noise for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Jiang, Zhengyan Shi, Dell Zhang, Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning. Code is available at https://github.com/ASCIIJK/MiN-NeurIPS2025.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akwasi Asare, Ulas Bagci</p>
<p>Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of 1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96) on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable, trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer prevention.</p>

The final model classifies disease severity with an accuracy of 85.4%, enabling real-time screening in clinical and telemedicine settings. PerceptronCARE integrates cloud-based scalability, secure patient data management, and a multi-user framework, facilitating early diagnosis, improving doctor-patient interactions, and reducing healthcare costs.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490 CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further validated on public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Chi Kit Wong, Chenfei Liao, Lutao Jiang, Xu Zheng, Zexin Lu, Linfeng Zhang, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Liu, Xinyuan Shi, Xiaondan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilhan Skender, Kailin Tong, Selim Solmaz, Daniel Watzenig</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response. Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 71% and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Lavida-O, a unified Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) for multimodal understanding and generation. Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference. These advances establish Lavida-O as a new paradigm for scalable multimodal reasoning and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Xu, Lei Cheng, Ngai Wong, Yik-Chung Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor train (TT) representation has achieved tremendous success in visual data completion tasks, especially when it is combined with tensor folding. However, folding an image or video tensor breaks the original data structure, leading to local information loss as nearby pixels may be assigned into different dimensions and become far away from each other. In this paper, to fully preserve the local information of the original visual data, we explore not folding the data tensor, and at the same time adopt graph information to regularize local similarity between nearby entries. To overcome the high computational complexity introduced by the graph-based regularization in the TT completion problem, we propose to break the original problem into multiple sub-problems with respect to each TT core fiber, instead of each TT core as in traditional methods. Furthermore, to avoid heavy parameter tuning, a sparsity promoting probabilistic model is built based on the generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) prior, and an inference algorithm is derived under the mean-field approximation. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world visual data show the superiority of the proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vighnesh Birodkar, Gabriel Barcik, James Lyon, Sergey Ioffe, David Minnen, Joshua V. Dillon</p>
<p>Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss and showing that it can lead to higher compression and better generation. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxi Ye, Grace Chu, Yanfeng Liu, Yichi Zhang, Lukasz Lew, Li Zhang, Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beichen Wang, Juexiao Zhang, Shuwen Dong, Irving Fang, Chen Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently been adopted in robotics for their capability in common sense reasoning and generalizability. Existing work has applied VLMs to generate task and motion planning from natural language instructions and simulate training data for robot learning. In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saumya Saxena, Blake Buchanan, Chris Paxton, Peiqi Liu, Bingqing Chen, Narunas Vaskevicius, Luigi Palmieri, Jonathan Francis, Oliver Kroemer</p>
<p>Abstract: In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a semantic understanding of an unseen environment to answer a situated question with confidence. This problem remains challenging in robotics, due to the difficulties in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online, and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient planning and exploration. To address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantics-guided exploration. We evaluate GraphEQA in simulation on two benchmark datasets, HM-EQA and OpenEQA, and demonstrate that it outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps. We further demonstrate GraphEQA in multiple real-world home and office environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lantao Li, Kang Yang, Wenqi Zhang, Xiaoxue Wang, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception enhances autonomous driving by leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for multi-agent sensor fusion. However, most existing methods rely on single-modal data sharing, limiting fusion performance, particularly in heterogeneous sensor settings involving both LiDAR and cameras across vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To address this, we propose Radian Glue Attention (RG-Attn), a lightweight and generalizable cross-modal fusion module that unifies intra-agent and inter-agent fusion via transformation-based coordinate alignment and a unified sampling/inversion strategy. RG-Attn efficiently aligns features through a radian-based attention constraint, operating column-wise on geometrically consistent regions to reduce overhead and preserve spatial coherence, thereby enabling accurate and robust fusion. Building upon RG-Attn, we propose three cooperative architectures. The first, Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP), prioritizes communication efficiency but assumes all agents have LiDAR, optionally paired with cameras. The second, Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), offers maximal flexibility, supporting any sensor setup (e.g., LiDAR-only, camera-only, or both) and enabling strong cross-modal generalization for real-world deployment. The third, Pyramid-RG-Attn Fusion (PRGAF), aims for peak detection accuracy with the highest computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show our framework delivers state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high flexibility and efficiency.

<p>Abstract: While spatial reasoning has made progress in object localization relationships, it often overlooks object orientation-a key factor in 6-DoF fine-grained manipulation. Traditional pose representations rely on pre-defined frames or templates, limiting generalization and semantic grounding. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the "plug-in" direction of a USB or the "handle" direction of a cup). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D objects annotated with semantic orientations, and develop PointSO, a general model for zero-shot semantic orientation prediction. By integrating semantic orientation into VLM agents, our SoFar framework enables 6-DoF spatial reasoning and generates robotic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of our SoFar, e.g., zero-shot 48.7% successful rate on Open6DOR and zero-shot 74.9% successful rate on SIMPLER-Env.</p>

<p>Abstract: The burgeoning growth of open-sourced vision-language models (VLMs) has catalyzed a plethora of applications across diverse domains. Ensuring the transparency and interpretability of these models is critical for fostering trustworthy and responsible AI systems. In this study, our objective is to delve into the internals of VLMs to interpret the functions of individual neurons. We observe the activations of neurons with respects to the input visual tokens and text tokens, and reveal some interesting findings. Particularly, we found that there are neurons responsible for only visual or text information, or both, respectively, which we refer to them as visual neurons, text neurons, and multi-modal neurons, respectively. We build a framework that automates the explanation of neurons with the assistant of GPT-4o. Meanwhile, for visual neurons, we propose an activation simulator to assess the reliability of the explanations for visual neurons. System statistical analyses on top of one representative VLM of LLaVA, uncover the behaviors/characteristics of different categories of neurons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saimouli Katragadda, Cho-Ying Wu, Yuliang Guo, Xinyu Huang, Guoquan Huang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: To enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with both humans and 3D environments, they must not only perceive the 3D world accurately but also align human language with 3D spatial representations. While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality. Experimental results show that our online method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art offline methods in accuracy but also achieves more than 40x efficiency boost, demonstrating the potential for dynamic and interactive AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Zhang, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Milo\v{s} Ha\v{s}an, Ziwen Chen, Fujun Luan, Julie Dorsey, Yiwei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating 3D scenes is still a challenging task due to the lack of readily available scene data. Most existing methods only produce partial scenes and provide limited navigational freedom. We introduce a practical and scalable solution that uses 360{\deg} video as an intermediate scene representation, capturing the full-scene context and ensuring consistent visual content throughout the generation. We propose WorldPrompter, a generative pipeline that synthesizes traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360{\deg} panoramic video generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor, enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model, trained with a mix of image and video data, achieves convincing spatial and temporal consistency for static scenes. This is validated by an average COLMAP matching rate of 94.6\%, allowing for high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and improved navigation throughout the scene. Qualitative and quantitative results also show it outperforms the state-of-the-art 360{\deg} video generators and 3D scene generation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are the backbone of modern artificial intelligence, but designing, evaluating, and comparing them remains labor-intensive. While numerous datasets exist for training, there are few standardized collections of the models themselves. We introduce LEMUR, an open-source dataset and framework that provides a large collection of PyTorch-based neural networks across tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, and natural language processing. Each model follows a unified template, with configurations and results stored in a structured database to ensure consistency and reproducibility. LEMUR integrates automated hyperparameter optimization via Optuna, includes statistical analysis and visualization tools, and offers an API for seamless access to performance data. The framework is extensible, allowing researchers to add new models, datasets, or metrics without breaking compatibility. By standardizing implementations and unifying evaluation, LEMUR aims to accelerate AutoML research, enable fair benchmarking, and reduce barriers to large-scale neural network experimentation.

<p>Abstract: The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a region impacted extensively and non-uniformly in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Regional MTL morphometric measures extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are supportive features for the diagnosis of AD and related disorders (ADRD). Different MRI modalities have distinct advantages for MTL morphometry. Anisotropic T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is preferred for hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast between hippocampal layers. Isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) MRI is beneficial for thickness calculation of extra-hippocampal subregions due to its stable image quality and isotropic resolution. We propose a multi-modality MTL segmentation algorithm that bridges the T1w and T2w modalities by bringing both to a nearly isotropic voxel space. Guided by high-resolution ex vivo 9.4T MRI, an upsampling model was designed for the ground truth segmentations. Combined with non-local means upsampling, this model was used to construct a nearly iso-tropic T1w and T2w MTL subregion segmentation training set, which was used to train a nnUNet model. Morphometric biomarkers extracted by this model were compared to those extracted using conventional models operating in anisotropic spaces on downstream tasks. Biomarkers extracted using the proposed model had greater ability to discriminate between individuals with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired; and had great-er longitudinal stability. These findings suggest that the biomarkers derived from T1w and T2w MRI unsampled to nearly isotropic resolution have sig-nificant potential for improving disease diagnosis and monitoring disease progression in ADRD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxin Xiang, Ke Li, Mingquan Liu, Zhixiang Cheng, Bin Yao, Wenjie Du, Jun Xia, Li Zeng, Xin Jin, Xiangxiang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</p>

<p>Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Lu, Ethan Weinberger, Chanwoo Kim, Su-In Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells' morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Ray,  Ashesh, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the point cloud registration problem, where well-known methods like ICP fail under uncertainty arising from sensor noise, pose-estimation errors, and partial overlap due to occlusion. We develop a novel approach, Gaussian Process Concept Attribution (GP-CA), which not only quantifies registration uncertainty but also explains it by attributing uncertainty to well-known sources of errors in registration problems. Our approach leverages active learning to discover new uncertainty sources in the wild by querying informative instances. We validate GP-CA on three publicly available datasets and in our real-world robot experiment. Extensive ablations substantiate our design choices. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime, high sample-efficiency with active learning, and high accuracy. Our real-world experiment clearly demonstrates its applicability. Our video also demonstrates that GP-CA enables effective failure-recovery behaviors, yielding more robust robotic perception.</p>

Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.</p>
