<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanat Sharma, Mayank Poddar, Jayant Kumar, Kosta Blank, Tracy King</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs are useful tools to organize, recommend and sort data. Hierarchies in knowledge graphs provide significant benefit in improving understanding and compartmentalization of the data within a knowledge graph. This work leverages large language models to generate and augment hierarchies in an existing knowledge graph. For small (<100,000 node) domain-specific KGs, we find that a combination of few-shot prompting with one-shot generation works well, while larger KG may require cyclical generation. We present techniques for augmenting hierarchies, which led to coverage increase by 98% for intents and 99% for colors in our knowledge graph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Tsurumaki, Chie Hieida, Kazuki Miyazawa</p>
<p>Abstract: How are emotions formed? Through extensive debate and the promulgation of diverse theories , the theory of constructed emotion has become prevalent in recent research on emotions. According to this theory, an emotion concept refers to a category formed by interoceptive and exteroceptive information associated with a specific emotion. An emotion concept stores past experiences as knowledge and can predict unobserved information from acquired information. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to model the formation of emotion concepts using a constructionist approach from the perspective of the constructed emotion theory. Particularly, we constructed a model using multilayered multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation , which is a probabilistic generative model. We then trained the model for each subject using vision, physiology, and word information obtained from multiple people who experienced different visual emotion-evoking stimuli. To evaluate the model, we verified whether the formed categories matched human subjectivity and determined whether unobserved information could be predicted via categories. The verification results exceeded chance level, suggesting that emotion concept formation can be explained by the proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Ledaguenel, C\'eline Hudelot, Mostepha Khouadjia</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is a growing field of research aiming to combine neural network learning capabilities with the reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. Informed multi-label classification is a sub-field of neurosymbolic AI which studies how to leverage prior knowledge to improve neural classification systems. A well known family of neurosymbolic techniques for informed classification use probabilistic reasoning to integrate this knowledge during learning, inference or both. Therefore, the asymptotic complexity of probabilistic reasoning is of cardinal importance to assess the scalability of such techniques. However, this topic is rarely tackled in the neurosymbolic literature, which can lead to a poor understanding of the limits of probabilistic neurosymbolic techniques. In this paper, we introduce a formalism for informed supervised classification tasks and techniques. We then build upon this formalism to define three abstract neurosymbolic techniques based on probabilistic reasoning. Finally, we show computational complexity results on several representation languages for prior knowledge commonly found in the neurosymbolic literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiva Aryal, Tuyen Do, Bisesh Heyojoo, Sandeep Chataut, Bichar Dip Shrestha Gurung, Venkataramana Gadhamshetty, Etienne Gnimpieba</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the ability to harness and integrate knowledge across various domains stands as a paramount challenge and opportunity. This study introduces a novel approach to cross-domain knowledge discovery through the deployment of multi-AI agents, each specialized in distinct knowledge domains. These AI agents, designed to function as domain-specific experts, collaborate in a unified framework to synthesize and provide comprehensive insights that transcend the limitations of single-domain expertise. By facilitating seamless interaction among these agents, our platform aims to leverage the unique strengths and perspectives of each, thereby enhancing the process of knowledge discovery and decision-making. We present a comparative analysis of the different multi-agent workflow scenarios evaluating their performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and the breadth of knowledge integration. Through a series of experiments involving complex, interdisciplinary queries, our findings demonstrate the superior capability of domain specific multi-AI agent system in identifying and bridging knowledge gaps. This research not only underscores the significance of collaborative AI in driving innovation but also sets the stage for future advancements in AI-driven, cross-disciplinary research and application. Our methods were evaluated on a small pilot data and it showed a trend we expected, if we increase the amount of data we custom train the agents, the trend is expected to be more smooth.</p>

<p>Abstract: Memory traces--changes in the memory system that result from the perception and encoding of an event--were measured in pioneering studies by Endel Tulving and Michael J. Watkins in 1975. These and further experiments informed the maturation of Tulving's memory model, from the GAPS (General Abstract Processing System} to the SPI (Serial-Parallel Independent) model. Having current top of the line LLMs revisit the original Tulving-Watkins tests may help in assessing whether foundation models completely instantiate or not this class of psychological models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xincan Feng, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Subsampling is effective in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) for reducing overfitting caused by the sparsity in Knowledge Graph (KG) datasets. However, current subsampling approaches consider only frequencies of queries that consist of entities and their relations. Thus, the existing subsampling potentially underestimates the appearance probabilities of infrequent queries even if the frequencies of their entities or relations are high. To address this problem, we propose Model-based Subsampling (MBS) and Mixed Subsampling (MIX) to estimate their appearance probabilities through predictions of KGE models. Evaluation results on datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 showed that our proposed subsampling methods actually improved the KG completion performances for popular KGE models, RotatE, TransE, HAKE, ComplEx, and DistMult.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengde Zhang, Yiyu Zhang, Haodong Yao, Jianwen Luo, Rui Zhao, Bo Huang, Jiameng Zhao, Yipu Liao, Ke Li, Lina Zhao, Jun Cao, Fazhi Qi, Changzheng Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are undergoing a period of rapid updates and changes, with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model frequently being replaced. When applying LLMs to a specific scientific field, it's challenging to acquire unique domain knowledge while keeping the model itself advanced. To address this challenge, a sophisticated large language model system named as Xiwu has been developed, allowing you switch between the most advanced foundation models and quickly teach the model domain knowledge. In this work, we will report on the best practices for applying LLMs in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), including: a seed fission technology is proposed and some data collection and cleaning tools are developed to quickly obtain domain AI-Ready dataset; a just-in-time learning system is implemented based on the vector store technology; an on-the-fly fine-tuning system has been developed to facilitate rapid training under a specified foundation model. The results show that Xiwu can smoothly switch between foundation models such as LLaMA, Vicuna, ChatGLM and Grok-1. The trained Xiwu model is significantly outperformed the benchmark model on the HEP knowledge question-and-answering and code generation. This strategy significantly enhances the potential for growth of our model's performance, with the hope of surpassing GPT-4 as it evolves with the development of open-source models. This work provides a customized LLM for the field of HEP, while also offering references for applying LLM to other fields, the corresponding codes are available on Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor G. Smit, Zaharah Bukhsh, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Kostas Alogariastos, Kasper Hendriks, Yingqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In collaborative human-robot order picking systems, human pickers and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) travel independently through a warehouse and meet at pick locations where pickers load items onto the AMRs. In this paper, we consider an optimization problem in such systems where we allocate pickers to AMRs in a stochastic environment. We propose a novel multi-objective Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to learn effective allocation policies to maximize pick efficiency while also aiming to improve workload fairness amongst human pickers. In our approach, we model the warehouse states using a graph, and define a neural network architecture that captures regional information and effectively extracts representations related to efficiency and workload. We develop a discrete-event simulation model, which we use to train and evaluate the proposed DRL approach. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our approach can find non-dominated policy sets that outline good trade-offs between fairness and efficiency objectives. The trained policies outperform the benchmarks in terms of both efficiency and fairness. Moreover, they show good transferability properties when tested on scenarios with different warehouse sizes. The implementation of the simulation model, proposed approach, and experiments are published.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Sarlak, Hazim Alzorgan, Sayed Pedram Haeri Boroujeni, Abolfazl Razi, Rahul Amin</p>
<p>Abstract: Sharing and joint processing of camera feeds and sensor measurements, known as Cooperative Perception (CP), has emerged as a new technique to achieve higher perception qualities. CP can enhance the safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) where their individual visual perception quality is compromised by adverse weather conditions (haze as foggy weather), low illumination, winding roads, and crowded traffic. To cover the limitations of former methods, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to realize an optimized CP under constrained communications. At the core of our approach is recruiting the best helper from the available list of front vehicles to augment the visual range and enhance the Object Detection (OD) accuracy of the ego vehicle. In this two-step process, we first select the helper vehicles that contribute the most to CP based on their visual range and lowest motion blur. Next, we implement a radio block optimization among the candidate vehicles to further improve communication efficiency. We specifically focus on pedestrian detection as an exemplary scenario. To validate our approach, we used the CARLA simulator to create a dataset of annotated videos for different driving scenarios where pedestrian detection is challenging for an AV with compromised vision. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-step optimization process in improving the overall performance of cooperative perception in challenging scenarios, substantially improving driving safety under adverse conditions. Finally, we note that the networking assumptions are adopted from LTE Release 14 Mode 4 side-link communication, commonly used for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. Nonetheless, our method is flexible and applicable to arbitrary V2V communications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Reddy Mekala, Elias Garratt, Matthias Muehle, Arjun Srinivasan, Adam Porter, Mikael Lindvall</p>
<p>Abstract: Process refinement to consistently produce high-quality material over a large area of the grown crystal, enabling various applications from optics crystals to quantum detectors, has long been a goal for diamond growth. Machine learning offers a promising path toward this goal, but faces challenges such as the complexity of features within datasets, their time-dependency, and the volume of data produced per growth run. Accurate spatial feature extraction from image to image for real-time monitoring of diamond growth is crucial yet complicated due to the low-volume and high feature complexity nature of the datasets. This paper compares various traditional and machine learning-driven approaches for feature extraction in the diamond growth domain, proposing a novel deep learning-driven semantic segmentation approach to isolate and classify accurate pixel masks of geometric features like diamond, pocket holder, and background, along with their derivative features based on shape and size. Using an annotation-focused human-in-the-loop software architecture for training datasets, with modules for selective data labeling using active learning, data augmentations, and model-assisted labeling, our approach achieves effective annotation accuracy and drastically reduces labeling time and cost. Deep learning algorithms prove highly efficient in accurately learning complex representations from datasets with many features. Our top-performing model, based on the DeeplabV3plus architecture, achieves outstanding accuracy in classifying features of interest, with accuracies of 96.31% for pocket holder, 98.60% for diamond top, and 91.64% for diamond side features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajarshi Haldar, Julia Hockenmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as Llama 2 perform very well on tasks that involve both natural language and source code, particularly code summarization and code generation. We show that for the task of code summarization, the performance of these models on individual examples often depends on the amount of (subword) token overlap between the code and the corresponding reference natural language descriptions in the dataset. This token overlap arises because the reference descriptions in standard datasets (corresponding to docstrings in large code bases) are often highly similar to the names of the functions they describe. We also show that this token overlap occurs largely in the function names of the code and compare the relative performance of these models after removing function names versus removing code structure. We also show that using multiple evaluation metrics like BLEU and BERTScore gives us very little additional insight since these metrics are highly correlated with each other.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Cheng, Bowen Zhang, Ziyu Wang, Ziyi Zhou, Weiqi Feng, Yi Lyu, Xingjian Diao</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Chen, Jiajing Xie, Yuxiang Lin, Yuhang Song, Wenxian Yang, Rongshan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning that combines pathological images with genomic data has significantly enhanced the accuracy of survival prediction. Nevertheless, existing methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure within both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which better intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be derived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal representations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high complexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data. Recently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising approach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low complexity. In this study, we propose Mamba with multi-grained multi-modal interaction (SurvMamba) for survival prediction. SurvMamba is implemented with a Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient intra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more detailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an Interaction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal interactive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival prediction. Comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that SurvMamba outperforms other existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost.</p>

However, the existing approaches are limited in terms of the quality of the generated Verilog code. To address such limitations, this paper introduces an innovative multi-expert LLM architecture for Verilog code generation (MEV-LLM). Our architecture uniquely integrates multiple LLMs, each specifically fine-tuned with a dataset that is categorized with respect to a distinct level of design complexity. It allows more targeted learning, directly addressing the nuances of generating Verilog code for each category. Empirical evidence from experiments highlights notable improvements in terms of the percentage of generated Verilog outputs that are syntactically and functionally correct. These findings underscore the efficacy of our approach, promising a forward leap in the field of automated hardware design through machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mazda Moayeri, Samyadeep Basu, Sriram Balasubramanian, Priyatham Kattakinda, Atoosa Chengini, Robert Brauneis, Soheil Feizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image generative models such as Stable Diffusion are extremely adept at mimicking and generating copyrighted content, raising concerns amongst artists that their unique styles may be improperly copied. Understanding how generative models copy "artistic style" is more complex than duplicating a single image, as style is comprised by a set of elements (or signature) that frequently co-occurs across a body of work, where each individual work may vary significantly. In our paper, we first reformulate the problem of "artistic copyright infringement" to a classification problem over image sets, instead of probing image-wise similarities. We then introduce ArtSavant, a practical (i.e., efficient and easy to understand) tool to (i) determine the unique style of an artist by comparing it to a reference dataset of works from 372 artists curated from WikiArt, and (ii) recognize if the identified style reappears in generated images. We leverage two complementary methods to perform artistic style classification over image sets, includingTagMatch, which is a novel inherently interpretable and attributable method, making it more suitable for broader use by non-technical stake holders (artists, lawyers, judges, etc). Leveraging ArtSavant, we then perform a large-scale empirical study to provide quantitative insight on the prevalence of artistic style copying across 3 popular text-to-image generative models. Namely, amongst a dataset of prolific artists (including many famous ones), only 20% of them appear to have their styles be at a risk of copying via simple prompting of today's popular text-to-image generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runtao Liu, Ashkan Khakzar, Jindong Gu, Qifeng Chen, Philip Torr, Fabio Pizzati</p>
<p>Abstract: With the ability to generate high-quality images, text-to-image (T2I) models can be exploited for creating inappropriate content. To prevent misuse, existing safety measures are either based on text blacklists, which can be easily circumvented, or harmful content classification, requiring large datasets for training and offering low flexibility. Hence, we propose Latent Guard, a framework designed to improve safety measures in text-to-image generation. Inspired by blacklist-based approaches, Latent Guard learns a latent space on top of the T2I model's text encoder, where it is possible to check the presence of harmful concepts in the input text embeddings. Our proposed framework is composed of a data generation pipeline specific to the task using large language models, ad-hoc architectural components, and a contrastive learning strategy to benefit from the generated data. The effectiveness of our method is verified on three datasets and against four baselines. Code and data will be shared at https://github.com/rt219/LatentGuard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keivan Faghih Niresi, Hugo Bissig, Henri Baumann, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is reshaping manufacturing, industrial processes, and infrastructure management. By fostering new levels of automation, efficiency, and predictive maintenance, IIoT is transforming traditional industries into intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems. However, achieving highly reliable IIoT can be hindered by factors such as the cost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting existing systems with sensors, or harsh environmental conditions that may make sensor installation impractical. Soft (virtual) sensing leverages mathematical models to estimate variables from physical sensor data, offering a solution to these challenges. Data-driven and physics-based modeling are the two main methodologies widely used for soft sensing. The choice between these strategies depends on the complexity of the underlying system, with the data-driven approach often being preferred when the physics-based inference models are intricate and present challenges for state estimation. However, conventional deep learning models are typically hindered by their inability to explicitly represent the complex interactions among various sensors. To address this limitation, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), renowned for their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between sensor measurements. In this research, we propose physics-enhanced GNNs, which integrate principles of physics into graph-based methodologies. This is achieved by augmenting additional nodes in the input graph derived from the underlying characteristics of the physical processes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Tomas Arias-Vergara, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Tobias Weise, Kai Packhaeuser, Maria Schuster, Elmar Noeth, Andreas Maier, Seung Hee Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Integration of speech into healthcare has intensified privacy concerns due to its potential as a non-invasive biomarker containing individual biometric information. In response, speaker anonymization aims to conceal personally identifiable information while retaining crucial linguistic content. However, the application of anonymization techniques to pathological speech, a critical area where privacy is especially vital, has not been extensively examined. This study investigates anonymization's impact on pathological speech across over 2,700 speakers from multiple German institutions, focusing on privacy, pathological utility, and demographic fairness. We explore both training-based and signal processing-based anonymization methods, and document substantial privacy improvements across disorders-evidenced by equal error rate increases up to 1933%, with minimal overall impact on utility. Specific disorders such as Dysarthria, Dysphonia, and Cleft Lip and Palate experienced minimal utility changes, while Dysglossia showed slight improvements. Our findings underscore that the impact of anonymization varies substantially across different disorders. This necessitates disorder-specific anonymization strategies to optimally balance privacy with diagnostic utility. Additionally, our fairness analysis revealed consistent anonymization effects across most of the demographics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of anonymization in pathological speech for enhancing privacy, while also highlighting the importance of customized approaches to account for inversion attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Al-Lawati, Elsayed Eshra, Prasenjit Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory generation is an important task in movement studies; it circumvents the privacy, ethical, and technical challenges of collecting real trajectories from the target population. In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Maike Behrendt, Marc Ziegele, Stefan Harmeling</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection is an important task for many applications that analyse or support online political discussions. Common approaches include fine-tuning transformer based models. However, these models require a large amount of labelled data, which might not be available. In this work, we present two different ways to leverage LLM-generated synthetic data to train and improve stance detection agents for online political discussions: first, we show that augmenting a small fine-tuning dataset with synthetic data can improve the performance of the stance detection model. Second, we propose a new active learning method called SQBC based on the "Query-by-Comittee" approach. The key idea is to use LLM-generated synthetic data as an oracle to identify the most informative unlabelled samples, that are selected for manual labelling. Comprehensive experiments show that both ideas can improve the stance detection performance. Curiously, we observed that fine-tuning on actively selected samples can exceed the performance of using the full dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Gautam, Youngsuk Park, Hao Zhou, Parameswaran Raman, Wooseok Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has demonstrated success in a wide array of downstream tasks. However, as LMs are scaled up, the memory requirements for backpropagation become prohibitively high. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods can leverage memory-efficient forward passes to estimate gradients. More recently, MeZO, an adaptation of ZO-SGD, has been shown to consistently outperform zero-shot and in-context learning when combined with suitable task prompts. In this work, we couple ZO methods with variance reduction techniques to enhance stability and convergence for inference-based LM fine-tuning. We introduce Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance-Reduced Gradient (MeZO-SVRG) and demonstrate its efficacy across multiple LM fine-tuning tasks, eliminating the reliance on task-specific prompts. Evaluated across a range of both masked and autoregressive LMs on benchmark GLUE tasks, MeZO-SVRG outperforms MeZO with up to 20% increase in test accuracies in both full- and partial-parameter fine-tuning settings. MeZO-SVRG benefits from reduced computation time as it often surpasses MeZO's peak test accuracy with a $2\times$ reduction in GPU-hours. MeZO-SVRG significantly reduces the required memory footprint compared to first-order SGD, i.e. by $2\times$ for autoregressive models. Our experiments highlight that MeZO-SVRG's memory savings progressively improve compared to SGD with larger batch sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report presents GMUNLP's participation to the Dialect-Copa shared task at VarDial 2024, which focuses on evaluating the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on South Slavic micro-dialects. The task aims to assess how well LLMs can handle non-standard dialectal varieties, as their performance on standard languages is already well-established. We propose an approach that combines the strengths of different types of language models and leverages data augmentation techniques to improve task performance on three South Slavic dialects: Chakavian, Cherkano, and Torlak. We conduct experiments using a language-family-focused encoder-based model (BERTi\'c) and a domain-agnostic multilingual model (AYA-101). Our results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation techniques lead to substantial performance gains across all three test datasets in the open-source model category. This work highlights the practical utility of data augmentation and the potential of LLMs in handling non-standard dialectal varieties, contributing to the broader goal of advancing natural language understanding in low-resource and dialectal settings.

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great strides in many areas lately, yet it has had comparatively little success in general-use robotics. We believe one of the reasons for this is the disconnect between traditional robotic design and the properties needed for open-ended, creativity-based AI systems. To that end, we, taking selective inspiration from nature, build a robust, partially soft robotic limb with a large action space, rich sensory data stream from multiple cameras, and the ability to connect with others to enhance the action space and data stream. As a proof of concept, we train two contemporary machine learning algorithms to perform a simple target-finding task. Altogether, we believe that this design serves as a first step to building a robot tailor-made for achieving artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Face attribute editing plays a pivotal role in various applications. However, existing methods encounter challenges in achieving high-quality results while preserving identity, editing faithfulness, and temporal consistency. These challenges are rooted in issues related to the training pipeline, including limited supervision, architecture design, and optimization strategy. In this work, we introduce S3Editor, a Sparse Semantic-disentangled Self-training framework for face video editing. S3Editor is a generic solution that comprehensively addresses these challenges with three key contributions. Firstly, S3Editor adopts a self-training paradigm to enhance the training process through semi-supervision. Secondly, we propose a semantic disentangled architecture with a dynamic routing mechanism that accommodates diverse editing requirements. Thirdly, we present a structured sparse optimization schema that identifies and deactivates malicious neurons to further disentangle impacts from untarget attributes. S3Editor is model-agnostic and compatible with various editing approaches. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative results affirm that our approach significantly enhances identity preservation, editing fidelity, as well as temporal consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Panitsas, Akrit Mudvari, Ali Maatouk, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Next-generation cellular networks will evolve into more complex and virtualized systems, employing machine learning for enhanced optimization and leveraging higher frequency bands and denser deployments to meet varied service demands. This evolution, while bringing numerous advantages, will also pose challenges, especially in mobility management, as it will increase the overall number of handovers due to smaller coverage areas and the higher signal attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based algorithm for predicting the future serving cell utilizing sequential user equipment measurements to minimize the handover failures and interruption time. Our algorithm enables network operators to dynamically adjust handover triggering events or incorporate UAV base stations for enhanced coverage and capacity, optimizing network objectives like load balancing and energy efficiency through transfer learning techniques. Our framework complies with the O-RAN specifications and can be deployed in a Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller as an xApp leveraging the E2SM-KPM service model. The evaluation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a 92% accuracy in predicting future serving cells with high probability. Finally, by utilizing transfer learning, our algorithm significantly reduces the retraining time by 91% and 77% when new handover trigger decisions or UAV base stations are introduced to the network dynamically.</p>

We propose a novel factorized framework in which an auction module and an LLM module work together via a prediction model to provide welfare maximizing summary outputs in an incentive compatible manner.

<p>Abstract: Color constancy (CC) describes the ability of the visual system to perceive an object as having a relatively constant color despite changes in lighting conditions. While CC and its limitations have been carefully characterized in humans, it is still unclear how the visual system acquires this ability during development. Here, we present a first study showing that CC develops in a neural network trained in a self-supervised manner through an invariance learning objective. During learning, objects are presented under changing illuminations, while the network aims to map subsequent views of the same object onto close-by latent representations. This gives rise to representations that are largely invariant to the illumination conditions, offering a plausible example of how CC could emerge during human cognitive development via a form of self-supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Fang, Rohan Bindu, Akul Gupta, Daniel Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have becoming increasingly powerful, both in their benign and malicious uses. With the increase in capabilities, researchers have been increasingly interested in their ability to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In particular, recent work has conducted preliminary studies on the ability of LLM agents to autonomously hack websites. However, these studies are limited to simple vulnerabilities.
  In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously exploit one-day vulnerabilities in real-world systems. To show this, we collected a dataset of 15 one-day vulnerabilities that include ones categorized as critical severity in the CVE description. When given the CVE description, GPT-4 is capable of exploiting 87% of these vulnerabilities compared to 0% for every other model we test (GPT-3.5, open-source LLMs) and open-source vulnerability scanners (ZAP and Metasploit). Fortunately, our GPT-4 agent requires the CVE description for high performance: without the description, GPT-4 can exploit only 7% of the vulnerabilities. Our findings raise questions around the widespread deployment of highly capable LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farajollah Tahernezhad-Javazm, Farajollah Tahernezhad-Javazm, Naomi Du Bois, Alice E. Smith, Damien Coyle</p>
<p>Abstract: Choosing an appropriate optimization algorithm is essential to achieving success in optimization challenges. Here we present a new evolutionary algorithm structure that utilizes a reinforcement learning-based agent aimed at addressing these issues. The agent employs a double deep q-network to choose a specific evolutionary operator based on feedback it receives from the environment during optimization. The algorithm's structure contains five single-objective evolutionary algorithm operators. This single-objective structure is transformed into a multi-objective one using the R2 indicator. This indicator serves two purposes within our structure: first, it renders the algorithm multi-objective, and second, provides a means to evaluate each algorithm's performance in each generation to facilitate constructing the reinforcement learning-based reward function. The proposed R2-reinforcement learning multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (R2-RLMOEA) is compared with six other multi-objective algorithms that are based on R2 indicators. These six algorithms include the operators used in R2-RLMOEA as well as an R2 indicator-based algorithm that randomly selects operators during optimization. We benchmark performance using the CEC09 functions, with performance measured by inverted generational distance and spacing. The R2-RLMOEA algorithm outperforms all other algorithms with strong statistical significance (p<0.001) when compared with the average spacing metric across all ten benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advancement in generative language models, the selection of prompts has gained significant attention in recent years. A prompt is an instruction or description provided by the user, serving as a guide for the generative language model in content generation. Despite existing methods for prompt selection that are based on human labor, we consider facilitating this selection through simulation optimization, aiming to maximize a pre-defined score for the selected prompt. Specifically, we propose a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we determine a feasible set of prompts in sufficient numbers, where each prompt is represented by a moderate-dimensional vector. In the subsequent stage for evaluation and selection, we construct a surrogate model of the score regarding the moderate-dimensional vectors that represent the prompts. We propose sequentially selecting the prompt for evaluation based on this constructed surrogate model. We prove the consistency of the sequential evaluation procedure in our framework. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, providing practical instructions for implementation.</p>

While large language models (LLM) have taken the world by storm, without eliminating or at least reducing hallucinations, real-world GenAI systems may face challenges in user adoption. In the process of deploying an enterprise application that produces workflows based on natural language requirements, we devised a system leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to greatly improve the quality of the structured output that represents such workflows. Thanks to our implementation of RAG, our proposed system significantly reduces hallucinations in the output and improves the generalization of our LLM in out-of-domain settings. In addition, we show that using a small, well-trained retriever encoder can reduce the size of the accompanying LLM, thereby making deployments of LLM-based systems less resource-intensive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haili Sun, Yan Huang, Lansheng Han, Cai Fu, Chunjie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Bai, Ran Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization plays a key role in the machine learning domain. Its significance is especially pronounced in reinforcement learning (RL), where agents continuously interact with and adapt to their environments, requiring dynamic adjustments in their learning trajectories. To cater to this dynamicity, the Population-Based Training (PBT) was introduced, leveraging the collective intelligence of a population of agents learning simultaneously. However, PBT tends to favor high-performing agents, potentially neglecting the explorative potential of agents on the brink of significant advancements. To mitigate the limitations of PBT, we present the Generalized Population-Based Training (GPBT), a refined framework designed for enhanced granularity and flexibility in hyperparameter adaptation. Complementing GPBT, we further introduce Pairwise Learning (PL). Instead of merely focusing on elite agents, PL employs a comprehensive pairwise strategy to identify performance differentials and provide holistic guidance to underperforming agents. By integrating the capabilities of GPBT and PL, our approach significantly improves upon traditional PBT in terms of adaptability and computational efficiency. Rigorous empirical evaluations across a range of RL benchmarks confirm that our approach consistently outperforms not only the conventional PBT but also its Bayesian-optimized variant.</p>

<p>Abstract: Determining dense feature points on fingerprints used in constructing deep fixed-length representations for accurate matching, particularly at the pixel level, is of significant interest. To explore the interpretability of fingerprint matching, we propose a multi-stage interpretable fingerprint matching network, namely Interpretable Fixed-length Representation for Fingerprint Matching via Vision Transformer (IFViT), which consists of two primary modules. The first module, an interpretable dense registration module, establishes a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Siamese Network to capture long-range dependencies and the global context in fingerprint pairs. It provides interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points for fingerprint alignment and enhances the interpretability in the subsequent matching stage. The second module takes into account both local and global representations of the aligned fingerprint pair to achieve an interpretable fixed-length representation extraction and matching. It employs the ViTs trained in the first module with the additional fully connected layer and retrains them to simultaneously produce the discriminative fixed-length representation and interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points. Extensive experimental results on diverse publicly available fingerprint databases demonstrate that the proposed framework not only exhibits superior performance on dense registration and matching but also significantly promotes the interpretability in deep fixed-length representations-based fingerprint matching.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms, renowned as powerful black-box optimizers, leverage a group of individuals to cooperatively search for the optimum. The exploration-exploitation tradeoff (EET) plays a crucial role in EC, which, however, has traditionally been governed by manually designed rules. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework that autonomously configures and adapts the EET throughout the EC search process. The framework allows different individuals of the population to selectively attend to the global and local exemplars based on the current search state, maximizing the cooperative search outcome. Our proposed framework is characterized by its simplicity, effectiveness, and generalizability, with the potential to enhance numerous existing EC algorithms. To validate its capabilities, we apply our framework to several representative EC algorithms and conduct extensive experiments on the augmented CEC2021 benchmark. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of the backbone algorithms, as well as favorable generalization across diverse problem classes, dimensions, and population sizes. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the EET issue by interpreting the learned behaviors of EC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving multimodal optimization problems (MMOP) requires finding all optimal solutions, which is challenging in limited function evaluations. Although existing works strike the balance of exploration and exploitation through hand-crafted adaptive strategies, they require certain expert knowledge, hence inflexible to deal with MMOP with different properties. In this paper, we propose RLEMMO, a Meta-Black-Box Optimization framework, which maintains a population of solutions and incorporates a reinforcement learning agent for flexibly adjusting individual-level searching strategies to match the up-to-date optimization status, hence boosting the search performance on MMOP. Concretely, we encode landscape properties and evolution path information into each individual and then leverage attention networks to advance population information sharing. With a novel reward mechanism that encourages both quality and diversity, RLEMMO can be effectively trained using a policy gradient algorithm. The experimental results on the CEC2013 MMOP benchmark underscore the competitive optimization performance of RLEMMO against several strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kosuke Takahashi, Takahiro Omi, Kosuke Arima, Tatsuya Ishigaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Several previous studies have considered language- and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) as separate topics. This study explores the combination of a non-English language and a high-demand industry domain, focusing on a Japanese business-specific LLM. This type of a model requires expertise in the business domain, strong language skills, and regular updates of its knowledge. We trained a 13-billion-parameter LLM from scratch using a new dataset of business texts and patents, and continually pretrained it with the latest business documents. Further we propose a new benchmark for Japanese business domain question answering (QA) and evaluate our models on it. The results show that our pretrained model improves QA accuracy without losing general knowledge, and that continual pretraining enhances adaptation to new information. Our pretrained model and business domain benchmark are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pu Li, Xiaoyan Yu, Hao Peng, Yantuan Xian, Linqin Wang, Li Sun, Jingyun Zhang, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social Event Detection (SED) aims to identify significant events from social streams, and has a wide application ranging from public opinion analysis to risk management. In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, GNN-based methods often struggle with noisy and missing edges between messages, affecting the quality of learned message embedding. Moreover, these methods statically initialize node embedding before training, which, in turn, limits the ability to learn from message texts and relations simultaneously. In this paper, we approach social event detection from a new perspective based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and present RPLM_SED (Relational prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection). We first propose a new pairwise message modeling strategy to construct social messages into message pairs with multi-relational sequences. Secondly, a new multi-relational prompt-based pairwise message learning mechanism is proposed to learn more comprehensive message representation from message pairs with multi-relational prompts using PLMs. Thirdly, we design a new clustering constraint to optimize the encoding process by enhancing intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster dispersion, making the message representation more distinguishable. We evaluate the RPLM_SED on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the RPLM_SED model achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline, online, low-resource, and long-tail distribution scenarios for social event detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Wang, Jun Ai, Minyan Lu, Haoran Su, Dan Yu, Yutao Zhang, Junda Zhu, Jingyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant attention given to the robustness assessment of neural networks. Robustness plays a critical role in ensuring reliable operation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in complex and uncertain environments. Deep learning's robustness problem is particularly significant, highlighted by the discovery of adversarial attacks on image classification models. Researchers have dedicated efforts to evaluate robustness in diverse perturbation conditions for image recognition tasks. Robustness assessment encompasses two main techniques: robustness verification/ certification for deliberate adversarial attacks and robustness testing for random data corruptions. In this survey, we present a detailed examination of both adversarial robustness (AR) and corruption robustness (CR) in neural network assessment. Analyzing current research papers and standards, we provide an extensive overview of robustness assessment in image recognition. Three essential aspects are analyzed: concepts, metrics, and assessment methods. We investigate the perturbation metrics and range representations used to measure the degree of perturbations on images, as well as the robustness metrics specifically for the robustness conditions of classification models. The strengths and limitations of the existing methods are also discussed, and some potential directions for future research are provided.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) of Prompt Jailbreaking are getting more and more attention, it is of great significance to raise a generalized research paradigm to evaluate attack strengths and a basic model to conduct subtler experiments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by focusing on a set of target questions that are inherently more sensitive to jailbreak prompts, aiming to circumvent the limitations posed by enhanced LLM security. Through designing and analyzing these sensitive questions, this paper reveals a more effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs, thereby contributing to the advancement of LLM security. This research not only challenges existing jailbreaking methodologies but also fortifies LLMs against potential exploits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muzhi Li, Minda Hu, Irwin King, Ho-fung Leung</p>
<p>Abstract: The Knowledge Graph Entity Typing (KGET) task aims to predict missing type annotations for entities in knowledge graphs. Recent works only utilize the \textit{\textbf{structural knowledge}} in the local neighborhood of entities, disregarding \textit{\textbf{semantic knowledge}} in the textual representations of entities, relations, and types that are also crucial for type inference. Additionally, we observe that the interaction between semantic and structural knowledge can be utilized to address the false-negative problem. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{\underline{S}}emantic and \textbf{\underline{S}}tructure-aware KG \textbf{\underline{E}}ntity \textbf{\underline{T}}yping~{(SSET)} framework, which is composed of three modules. First, the \textit{Semantic Knowledge Encoding} module encodes factual knowledge in the KG with a Masked Entity Typing task. Then, the \textit{Structural Knowledge Aggregation} module aggregates knowledge from the multi-hop neighborhood of entities to infer missing types. Finally, the \textit{Unsupervised Type Re-ranking} module utilizes the inference results from the two models above to generate type predictions that are robust to false-negative samples. Extensive experiments show that SSET significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Cheng, Bo Chen, Fanjin Zhang, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: From-scratch name disambiguation is an essential task for establishing a reliable foundation for academic platforms. It involves partitioning documents authored by identically named individuals into groups representing distinct real-life experts. Canonically, the process is divided into two decoupled tasks: locally estimating the pairwise similarities between documents followed by globally grouping these documents into appropriate clusters. However, such a decoupled approach often inhibits optimal information exchange between these intertwined tasks. Therefore, we present BOND, which bootstraps the local and global informative signals to promote each other in an end-to-end regime. Specifically, BOND harnesses local pairwise similarities to drive global clustering, subsequently generating pseudo-clustering labels. These global signals further refine local pairwise characterizations. The experimental results establish BOND's superiority, outperforming other advanced baselines by a substantial margin. Moreover, an enhanced version, BOND+, incorporating ensemble and post-match techniques, rivals the top methods in the WhoIsWho competition.</p>

<p>Abstract: In today's digital world, seeking answers to health questions on the Internet is a common practice. However, existing question answering (QA) systems often rely on using pre-selected and annotated evidence documents, thus making them inadequate for addressing novel questions. Our study focuses on the open-domain QA setting, where the key challenge is to first uncover relevant evidence in large knowledge bases. By utilizing the common retrieve-then-read QA pipeline and PubMed as a trustworthy collection of medical research documents, we answer health questions from three diverse datasets. We modify different retrieval settings to observe their influence on the QA pipeline's performance, including the number of retrieved documents, sentence selection process, the publication year of articles, and their number of citations. Our results reveal that cutting down on the amount of retrieved documents and favoring more recent and highly cited documents can improve the final macro F1 score up to 10%. We discuss the results, highlight interesting examples, and outline challenges for future research, like managing evidence disagreement and crafting user-friendly explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongbo Xi, Zhen Chen, Yuexian Wang, He Cui, Chong Peng, Fuzhen Zhuang, Peng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Feed recommendation is currently the mainstream mode for many real-world applications (e.g., TikTok, Dianping), it is usually necessary to model and predict user interests in multiple scenarios (domains) within and even outside the application. Multi-domain learning is a typical solution in this regard. While considerable efforts have been made in this regard, there are still two long-standing challenges: (1) Accurately depicting the differences among domains using domain features is crucial for enhancing the performance of each domain. However, manually designing domain features and models for numerous domains can be a laborious task. (2) Users typically have limited impressions in only a few domains. Extracting features automatically from other domains and leveraging them to improve the predictive capabilities of each domain has consistently posed a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Automatic Domain Feature Extraction and Personalized Integration (DFEI) framework for the large-scale multi-domain recommendation. The framework automatically transforms the behavior of each individual user into an aggregation of all user behaviors within the domain, which serves as the domain features. Unlike offline feature engineering methods, the extracted domain features are higher-order representations and directly related to the target label. Besides, by personalized integration of domain features from other domains for each user and the innovation in the training mode, the DFEI framework can yield more accurate conversion identification. Experimental results on both public and industrial datasets, consisting of over 20 domains, clearly demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with SOTA baselines. Furthermore, we have released the source code of the proposed framework at https://github.com/xidongbo/DFEI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Ponti</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous in various fields, and deep learning methods have been successful applied in graph classification tasks. However, building large and diverse graph datasets for training can be expensive. While augmentation techniques exist for structured data like images or numerical data, the augmentation of graph data remains challenging. This is primarily due to the complex and non-Euclidean nature of graph data. In this paper, it has been proposed a novel augmentation strategy for graphs that operates in a non-Euclidean space. This approach leverages graphon estimation, which models the generative mechanism of networks sequences. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation framework in improving the performance of graph classification models. Additionally, using a non-Euclidean distance, specifically the Gromow-Wasserstein distance, results in better approximations of the graphon. This framework also provides a means to validate different graphon estimation approaches, particularly in real-world scenarios where the true graphon is unknown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Wang, Chengzhi Hu, Bolei Ma, Paul R\"ottger, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). One common way to evaluate the model response is to rank the candidate answers based on the log probability of the first token prediction. An alternative way is to examine the text output. Prior work has shown that first token probabilities lack robustness to changes in MCQ phrasing, and that first token probabilities do not match text answers for instruction-tuned models. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the robustness of text answers. We show that the text answers are more robust to question perturbations than the first token probabilities, when the first token answers mismatch the text answers. The difference in robustness increases as the mismatch rate becomes greater. As the mismatch reaches over 50\%, the text answer is more robust to option order changes than the debiased first token probabilities using state-of-the-art debiasing methods such as PriDe. Our findings provide further evidence for the benefits of text answer evaluation over first token probability evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Broadcast sports field registration is traditionally addressed as a homography estimation task, mapping the visible image area to a planar field model, predominantly focusing on the main camera shot. Addressing the shortcomings of previous approaches, we propose a novel calibration pipeline enabling camera calibration using a 3D soccer field model and extending the process to assess the multiple-view nature of broadcast videos. Our approach begins with a keypoint generation pipeline derived from SoccerNet dataset annotations, leveraging the geometric properties of the court. Subsequently, we execute classical camera calibration through DLT algorithm in a minimalist fashion, without further refinement. Through extensive experimentation on real-world soccer broadcast datasets such as SoccerNet-Calibration, WorldCup 2014 and TS- WorldCup, our method demonstrates superior performance in both multiple- and single-view 3D camera calibration while maintaining competitive results in homography estimation compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongtao Wang, Li Long, Jiangshe Zhang, Xiaoli Wei, Chunxia Zhang, Zhenbo Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary automatic first break (FB) picking methods typically analyze 1D signals, 2D source gathers, or 3D source-receiver gathers. Utilizing higher-dimensional data, such as 2D or 3D, incorporates global features, improving the stability of local picking. Despite the benefits, high-dimensional data requires structured input and increases computational demands. Addressing this, we propose a novel approach using deep graph learning called DGL-FB, constructing a large graph to efficiently extract information. In this graph, each seismic trace is represented as a node, connected by edges that reflect similarities. To manage the size of the graph, we develop a subgraph sampling technique to streamline model training and inference. Our proposed framework, DGL-FB, leverages deep graph learning for FB picking. It encodes subgraphs into global features using a deep graph encoder. Subsequently, the encoded global features are combined with local node signals and fed into a ResUNet-based 1D segmentation network for FB detection. Field survey evaluations of DGL-FB show superior accuracy and stability compared to a 2D U-Net-based benchmark method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siming Shan, Pengkai Wang, Song Chen, Jiaxu Liu, Chao Xu, Shengze Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of machine learning in fluid dynamics is becoming more common to expedite the computation when solving forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations. Yet, a notable challenge with existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for data fidelity enhancement is their reliance on specific low-fidelity data patterns and distributions during the training phase. In addition, the CNN-based method essentially treats the flow reconstruction task as a computer vision task that prioritizes the element-wise precision which lacks a physical and mathematical explanation. This dependence can dramatically affect the models' effectiveness in real-world scenarios, especially when the low-fidelity input deviates from the training data or contains noise not accounted for during training. The introduction of diffusion models in this context shows promise for improving performance and generalizability. Unlike direct mapping from a specific low-fidelity to a high-fidelity distribution, diffusion models learn to transition from any low-fidelity distribution towards a high-fidelity one. Our proposed model - Physics-informed Residual Diffusion, demonstrates the capability to elevate the quality of data from both standard low-fidelity inputs, to low-fidelity inputs with injected Gaussian noise, and randomly collected samples. By integrating physics-based insights into the objective function, it further refines the accuracy and the fidelity of the inferred high-quality data. Experimental results have shown that our approach can effectively reconstruct high-quality outcomes for two-dimensional turbulent flows from a range of low-fidelity input conditions without requiring retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongguang Ye, Longcan Chen, Jinyuan Zhang, Hisao Ishibuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Pareto Set Learning (PSL) has been proposed for learning the entire Pareto set using a neural network. PSL employs preference vectors to scalarize multiple objectives, facilitating the learning of mappings from preference vectors to specific Pareto optimal solutions. Previous PSL methods have shown their effectiveness in solving artificial multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) with uniform preference vector sampling. The quality of the learned Pareto set is influenced by the sampling strategy of the preference vector, and the sampling of the preference vector needs to be decided based on the Pareto front shape. However, a fixed preference sampling strategy cannot simultaneously adapt the Pareto front of multiple MOPs. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an Evolutionary Preference Sampling (EPS) strategy to efficiently sample preference vectors. Inspired by evolutionary algorithms, we consider preference sampling as an evolutionary process to generate preference vectors for neural network training. We integrate the EPS strategy into five advanced PSL methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method has a faster convergence speed than baseline algorithms on 7 testing problems. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rG223/EPS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of completing knowledge intensive tasks by recalling information from a static pretraining corpus. Here we are concerned with LLMs in the context of evolving data requirements. For instance: batches of new data that are introduced periodically; subsets of data with user-based access controls; or requirements on dynamic removal of documents with guarantees that associated knowledge cannot be recalled. We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion.</p>

Therefore, intention prediction is pivotal in creating a natural interactive collaboration between humans and robots. In this paper, we examine the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for inferring human intention during a collaborative object categorization task with a physical robot. We introduce a hierarchical approach for interpreting user non-verbal cues, like hand gestures, body poses, and facial expressions and combining them with environment states and user verbal cues captured using an existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. Our evaluation demonstrates the potential of LLMs to interpret non-verbal cues and to combine them with their context-understanding capabilities and real-world knowledge to support intention prediction during human-robot interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rising use of machine learning in various fields requires robust methods to create synthetic tabular data. Data should preserve key characteristics while addressing data scarcity challenges. Current approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks, such as the state-of-the-art CTGAN model, struggle with the complex structures inherent in tabular data. These data often contain both continuous and discrete features with non-Gaussian distributions. Therefore, we propose a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based model that addresses these limitations. Inspired by the TVAE model, our approach incorporates a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model (BGM) within the VAE architecture. This avoids the limitations imposed by assuming a strictly Gaussian latent space, allowing for a more accurate representation of the underlying data distribution during data generation. Furthermore, our model offers enhanced flexibility by allowing the use of various differentiable distributions for individual features, making it possible to handle both continuous and discrete data types. We thoroughly validate our model on three real-world datasets with mixed data types, including two medically relevant ones, based on their resemblance and utility. This evaluation demonstrates significant outperformance against CTGAN and TVAE, establishing its potential as a valuable tool for generating synthetic tabular data in various domains, particularly in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art neurosymbolic learning systems use probabilistic reasoning to guide neural networks towards predictions that conform to logical constraints over symbols. Many such systems assume that the probabilities of the considered symbols are conditionally independent given the input to simplify learning and reasoning. We study and criticise this assumption, highlighting how it can hinder optimisation and prevent uncertainty quantification. We prove that loss functions bias conditionally independent neural networks to become overconfident in their predictions. As a result, they are unable to represent uncertainty over multiple valid options. Furthermore, we prove that these loss functions are difficult to optimise: they are non-convex, and their minima are usually highly disconnected. Our theoretical analysis gives the foundation for replacing the conditional independence assumption and designing more expressive neurosymbolic probabilistic models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changho Shin, Jitian Zhao, Sonia Cromp, Harit Vishwakarma, Frederic Sala</p>
<p>Abstract: Popular zero-shot models suffer due to artifacts inherited from pretraining. A particularly detrimental artifact, caused by unbalanced web-scale pretraining data, is mismatched label distribution. Existing approaches that seek to repair the label distribution are not suitable in zero-shot settings, as they have incompatible requirements such as access to labeled downstream task data or knowledge of the true label balance in the pretraining distribution. We sidestep these challenges and introduce a simple and lightweight approach to adjust pretrained model predictions via optimal transport. Our technique requires only an estimate of the label distribution of a downstream task. Theoretically, we characterize the improvement produced by our procedure under certain mild conditions and provide bounds on the error caused by misspecification. Empirically, we validate our method in a wide array of zero-shot image and text classification tasks, improving accuracy by 4.8% and 15.9% on average, and beating baselines like Prior Matching -- often by significant margins -- in 17 out of 21 datasets.</p>

Our results show that learning by predicting video features leads to versatile visual representations that perform well on both motion and appearance-based tasks, without adaption of the model's parameters; e.g., using a frozen backbone. Our largest model, a ViT-H/16 trained only on videos, obtains 81.9% on Kinetics-400, 72.2% on Something-Something-v2, and 77.9% on ImageNet1K.</p>

<p>Abstract: We measure the Out-of-domain uncertainty in the prediction of Neural Networks using a statistical notion called ``Lens Depth'' (LD) combined with Fermat Distance, which is able to capture precisely the ``depth'' of a point with respect to a distribution in feature space, without any assumption about the form of distribution. Our method has no trainable parameter. The method is applicable to any classification model as it is applied directly in feature space at test time and does not intervene in training process. As such, it does not impact the performance of the original model. The proposed method gives excellent qualitative result on toy datasets and can give competitive or better uncertainty estimation on standard deep learning datasets compared to strong baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Zhao, Zefan Cai, Shuzheng Si, Liang Chen, Yufeng He, Kaikai An, Baobao Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale multilingual Pretrained Language Models (mPLMs) yield impressive performance on cross-language tasks, yet significant performance disparities exist across different languages within the same mPLM. Previous studies endeavored to narrow these disparities by supervise fine-tuning the mPLMs with multilingual data. However, obtaining labeled multilingual data is time-consuming, and fine-tuning mPLM with limited labeled multilingual data merely encapsulates the knowledge specific to the labeled data. Therefore, we introduce ALSACE to leverage the learned knowledge from the well-performing languages to guide under-performing ones within the same mPLM, eliminating the need for additional labeled multilingual data. Experiments show that ALSACE effectively mitigates language-level performance disparity across various mPLMs while showing the competitive performance on different multilingual NLU tasks, ranging from full resource to limited resource settings. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/pkunlp-icler/ALSACE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan D. Chang, Wenhao Shan, Owen Oertell, Kiant\'e Brantley, Dipendra Misra, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from Human Preference-based feedback is a popular paradigm for fine-tuning generative models, which has produced impressive models such as GPT-4 and Claude3 Opus. This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Dong, Haoxin Wang, Hengxi Zhang, Wenbo Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: When addressing the challenge of complex multi-objective optimization problems, particularly those with non-convex and non-uniform Pareto fronts, Decomposition-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEADs) often converge to local optima, thereby limiting solution diversity. Despite its significance, this issue has received limited theoretical exploration. Through a comprehensive geometric analysis, we identify that the traditional method of Reference Point (RP) selection fundamentally contributes to this challenge. In response, we introduce an innovative RP selection strategy, the Weight Vector-Guided and Gaussian-Hybrid method, designed to overcome the local optima issue. This approach employs a novel RP type that aligns with weight vector directions and integrates a Gaussian distribution to combine three distinct RP categories. Our research comprises two main experimental components: an ablation study involving 14 algorithms within the MOEADs framework, spanning from 2014 to 2022, to validate our theoretical framework, and a series of empirical tests to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method against both traditional and cutting-edge alternatives. Results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements in both population diversity and convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan D. Chang, Dhruv Sreenivas, Yingbing Huang, Kiant\'e Brantley, Wen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial imitation learning (AIL) has stood out as a dominant framework across various imitation learning (IL) applications, with Discriminator Actor Critic (DAC) (Kostrikov et al.,, 2019) demonstrating the effectiveness of off-policy learning algorithms in improving sample efficiency and scalability to higher-dimensional observations. Despite DAC's empirical success, the original AIL objective is on-policy and DAC's ad-hoc application of off-policy training does not guarantee successful imitation (Kostrikov et al., 2019; 2020). Follow-up work such as ValueDICE (Kostrikov et al., 2020) tackles this issue by deriving a fully off-policy AIL objective. Instead in this work, we develop a novel and principled AIL algorithm via the framework of boosting. Like boosting, our new algorithm, AILBoost, maintains an ensemble of properly weighted weak learners (i.e., policies) and trains a discriminator that witnesses the maximum discrepancy between the distributions of the ensemble and the expert policy. We maintain a weighted replay buffer to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble, allowing us to train discriminators using the entire data collected so far. In the weighted replay buffer, the contribution of the data from older policies are properly discounted with the weight computed based on the boosting framework. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on both controller state-based and pixel-based environments from the DeepMind Control Suite. AILBoost outperforms DAC on both types of environments, demonstrating the benefit of properly weighting replay buffer data for off-policy training. On state-based environments, DAC outperforms ValueDICE and IQ-Learn (Gary et al., 2021), achieving competitive performance with as little as one expert trajectory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Xie, Jiayang Song, Zhehua Zhou, Yuheng Huang, Da Song, Lei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across numerous fields, their limited interpretability poses concerns regarding their safe operations from multiple aspects, e.g., truthfulness, robustness, and fairness. Recent research has started developing quality assurance methods for LLMs, introducing techniques such as offline detector-based or uncertainty estimation methods. However, these approaches predominantly concentrate on post-generation analysis, leaving the online safety analysis for LLMs during the generation phase an unexplored area. To bridge this gap, we conduct in this work a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of existing online safety analysis methods on LLMs. We begin with a pilot study that validates the feasibility of detecting unsafe outputs in the early generation process. Following this, we establish the first publicly available benchmark of online safety analysis for LLMs, including a broad spectrum of methods, models, tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing this benchmark, we extensively analyze the performance of state-of-the-art online safety analysis methods on both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods and offers valuable insights into selecting the most appropriate method based on specific application scenarios and task requirements. Furthermore, we also explore the potential of using hybridization methods, i.e., combining multiple methods to derive a collective safety conclusion, to enhance the efficacy of online safety analysis for LLMs. Our findings indicate a promising direction for the development of innovative and trustworthy quality assurance methodologies for LLMs, facilitating their reliable deployments across diverse domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Murray, Tatiana Castillo, Jaime Carrasco, Andr\'es Weintraub, Richard Weber, Isaac Mart\'in de Diego, Jos\'e Ram\'on Gonz\'alez, Jordi Garc\'ia-Gonzalo</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decades, the increase in both frequency and intensity of large-scale wildfires due to climate change has emerged as a significant natural threat. The pressing need to design resilient landscapes capable of withstanding such disasters has become paramount, requiring the development of advanced decision-support tools. Existing methodologies, including Mixed Integer Programming, Stochastic Optimization, and Network Theory, have proven effective but are hindered by computational demands, limiting their applicability.
  In response to this challenge, we propose using artificial intelligence techniques, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning, to address the complex problem of firebreak placement in the landscape. We employ value-function based approaches like Deep Q-Learning, Double Deep Q-Learning, and Dueling Double Deep Q-Learning. Utilizing the Cell2Fire fire spread simulator combined with Convolutional Neural Networks, we have successfully implemented a computational agent capable of learning firebreak locations within a forest environment, achieving good results.
  Furthermore, we incorporate a pre-training loop, initially teaching our agent to mimic a heuristic-based algorithm and observe that it consistently exceeds the performance of these solutions. Our findings underscore the immense potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning for operational research challenges, especially in fire prevention. Our approach demonstrates convergence with highly favorable results in problem instances as large as 40 x 40 cells, marking a significant milestone in applying Reinforcement Learning to this critical issue.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents a pioneering effort in using Reinforcement Learning to address the aforementioned problem, offering promising perspectives in fire prevention and landscape management</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores object detection in historical aerial photographs of Namibia to identify long-term environmental changes. Specifically, we aim to identify key objects -- \textit{Waterholes}, \textit{Omuti homesteads}, and \textit{Big trees} -- around Oshikango in Namibia using sub-meter gray-scale aerial imagery from 1943 and 1972. In this work, we propose a workflow for analyzing historical aerial imagery using a deep semantic segmentation model on sparse hand-labels. To this end, we employ a number of strategies including class-weighting, pseudo-labeling and empirical p-value-based filtering to balance skewed and sparse representations of objects in the ground truth data. Results demonstrate the benefits of these different training strategies resulting in an average $F_1=0.661$ and $F_1=0.755$ over the three objects of interest for the 1943 and 1972 imagery, respectively. We also identified that the average size of Waterhole and Big trees increased while the average size of Omutis decreased between 1943 and 1972 reflecting some of the local effects of the massive post-Second World War economic, agricultural, demographic, and environmental changes. This work also highlights the untapped potential of historical aerial photographs in understanding long-term environmental changes beyond Namibia (and Africa). With the lack of adequate satellite technology in the past, archival aerial photography offers a great alternative to uncover decades-long environmental changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Chaudhari, Pranjal Aggarwal, Vishvak Murahari, Tanmay Rajpurohit, Ashwin Kalyan, Karthik Narasimhan, Ameet Deshpande, Bruno Castro da Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks. However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chirag Parikh, Rohit Saluja, C. V. Jawahar, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent vehicle systems require a deep understanding of the interplay between road conditions, surrounding entities, and the ego vehicle's driving behavior for safe and efficient navigation. This is particularly critical in developing countries where traffic situations are often dense and unstructured with heterogeneous road occupants. Existing datasets, predominantly geared towards structured and sparse traffic scenarios, fall short of capturing the complexity of driving in such environments. To fill this gap, we present IDD-X, a large-scale dual-view driving video dataset. With 697K bounding boxes, 9K important object tracks, and 1-12 objects per video, IDD-X offers comprehensive ego-relative annotations for multiple important road objects covering 10 categories and 19 explanation label categories. The dataset also incorporates rearview information to provide a more complete representation of the driving environment. We also introduce custom-designed deep networks aimed at multiple important object localization and per-object explanation prediction. Overall, our dataset and introduced prediction models form the foundation for studying how road conditions and surrounding entities affect driving behavior in complex traffic situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Litao Li, Steven H. H. Ding, Andrew Walenstein, Philippe Charland, Benjamin C. M. Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are a challenge in cybersecurity. Manual security patches are often difficult and slow to be deployed, while new vulnerabilities are created. Binary code vulnerability detection is less studied and more complex compared to source code, and this has important practical implications. Deep learning has become an efficient and powerful tool in the security domain, where it provides end-to-end and accurate prediction. Modern deep learning approaches learn the program semantics through sequence and graph neural networks, using various intermediate representation of programs, such as abstract syntax trees (AST) or control flow graphs (CFG). Due to the complex nature of program execution, the output of an execution depends on the many program states and inputs. Also, a CFG generated from static analysis can be an overestimation of the true program flow. Moreover, the size of programs often does not allow a graph neural network with fixed layers to aggregate global information. To address these issues, we propose DeepEXE, an agent-based implicit neural network that mimics the execution path of a program. We use reinforcement learning to enhance the branching decision at every program state transition and create a dynamic environment to learn the dependency between a vulnerability and certain program states. An implicitly defined neural network enables nearly infinite state transitions until convergence, which captures the structural information at a higher level. The experiments are conducted on two semi-synthetic and two real-world datasets. We show that DeepEXE is an accurate and efficient method and outperforms the state-of-the-art vulnerability detection methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CRITICAL, a novel closed-loop framework for autonomous vehicle (AV) training and testing. CRITICAL stands out for its ability to generate diverse scenarios, focusing on critical driving situations that target specific learning and performance gaps identified in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The framework achieves this by integrating real-world traffic dynamics, driving behavior analysis, surrogate safety measures, and an optional Large Language Model (LLM) component. It is proven that the establishment of a closed feedback loop between the data generation pipeline and the training process can enhance the learning rate during training, elevate overall system performance, and augment safety resilience. Our evaluations, conducted using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the HighwayEnv simulation environment, demonstrate noticeable performance improvements with the integration of critical case generation and LLM analysis, indicating CRITICAL's potential to improve the robustness of AV systems and streamline the generation of critical scenarios. This ultimately serves to hasten the development of AV agents, expand the general scope of RL training, and ameliorate validation efforts for AV safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) is known as an AI-complete task as it requires understanding, reasoning, and inferring about the vision and the language content. Over the past few years, numerous neural architectures have been suggested for the VQA problem. However, achieving success in zero-shot VQA remains a challenge due to its requirement for advanced generalization and reasoning skills. This study explores the impact of incorporating image captioning as an intermediary process within the VQA pipeline. Specifically, we explore the efficacy of utilizing image captions instead of images and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to establish a zero-shot setting. Since image captioning is the most crucial step in this process, we compare the impact of state-of-the-art image captioning models on VQA performance across various question types in terms of structure and semantics. We propose a straightforward and efficient question-driven image captioning approach within this pipeline to transfer contextual information into the question-answering (QA) model. This method involves extracting keywords from the question, generating a caption for each image-question pair using the keywords, and incorporating the question-driven caption into the LLM prompt. We evaluate the efficacy of using general-purpose and question-driven image captions in the VQA pipeline. Our study highlights the potential of employing image captions and harnessing the capabilities of LLMs to achieve competitive performance on GQA under the zero-shot setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Nguyen-Truong, E-Ro Nguyen, Tuan-Anh Vu, Minh-Triet Tran, Binh-Son Hua, Sai-Kit Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring image segmentation is a challenging task that involves generating pixel-wise segmentation masks based on natural language descriptions. Existing methods have relied mostly on visual features to generate the segmentation masks while treating text features as supporting components. This over-reliance on visual features can lead to suboptimal results, especially in complex scenarios where text prompts are ambiguous or context-dependent. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel framework VATEX to improve referring image segmentation by enhancing object and context understanding with Vision-Aware Text Feature. Our method involves using CLIP to derive a CLIP Prior that integrates an object-centric visual heatmap with text description, which can be used as the initial query in DETR-based architecture for the segmentation task. Furthermore, by observing that there are multiple ways to describe an instance in an image, we enforce feature similarity between text variations referring to the same visual input by two components: a novel Contextual Multimodal Decoder that turns text embeddings into vision-aware text features, and a Meaning Consistency Constraint to ensure further the coherent and consistent interpretation of language expressions with the context understanding obtained from the image. Our method achieves a significant performance improvement on three benchmark datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and G-Ref. Code is available at: https://nero1342.github.io/VATEX\_RIS.</p>

<p>Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose}$: Automatic quantification of longitudinal changes in PET scans for lymphoma patients has proven challenging, as residual disease in interim-therapy scans is often subtle and difficult to detect. Our goal was to develop a longitudinally-aware segmentation network (LAS-Net) that can quantify serial PET/CT images for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients. $\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: This retrospective study included baseline (PET1) and interim (PET2) PET/CT images from 297 patients enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group clinical trials (AHOD1331 and AHOD0831). LAS-Net incorporates longitudinal cross-attention, allowing relevant features from PET1 to inform the analysis of PET2. Model performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients for PET1 and detection F1 scores for PET2. Additionally, we extracted and compared quantitative PET metrics, including metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in PET1, as well as qPET and $\Delta$SUVmax in PET2, against physician measurements. We quantified their agreement using Spearman's $\rho$ correlations and employed bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis. $\textbf{Results}$: LAS-Net detected residual lymphoma in PET2 with an F1 score of 0.606 (precision/recall: 0.615/0.600), outperforming all comparator methods (P<0.01). For baseline segmentation, LAS-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.772. In PET quantification, LAS-Net's measurements of qPET, $\Delta$SUVmax, MTV and TLG were strongly correlated with physician measurements, with Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.78, 0.80, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. The performance remained high, with a slight decrease, in an external testing cohort. $\textbf{Conclusion}$: LAS-Net achieved high performance in quantifying PET metrics across serial scans, highlighting the value of longitudinal awareness in evaluating multi-time-point imaging datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingmeng Geng, Roberto Trotta</p>
<p>Abstract: Based on one million arXiv papers submitted from May 2018 to January 2024, we assess the textual density of ChatGPT's writing style in their abstracts by means of a statistical analysis of word frequency changes. Our model is calibrated and validated on a mixture of real abstracts and ChatGPT-modified abstracts (simulated data) after a careful noise analysis. We find that ChatGPT is having an increasing impact on arXiv abstracts, especially in the field of computer science, where the fraction of ChatGPT-revised abstracts is estimated to be approximately 35%, if we take the output of one of the simplest prompts, "revise the following sentences", as a baseline. We conclude with an analysis of both positive and negative aspects of the penetration of ChatGPT into academics' writing style.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leif Azzopardi, Mateusz Dubiel, Martin Halvey, Jeffery Dalton</p>
<p>Abstract: The conversational search task aims to enable a user to resolve information needs via natural language dialogue with an agent. In this paper, we aim to develop a conceptual framework of the actions and intents of users and agents explaining how these actions enable the user to explore the search space and resolve their information need. We outline the different actions and intents, before discussing key decision points in the conversation where the agent needs to decide how to steer the conversational search process to a successful and/or satisfactory conclusion. Essentially, this paper provides a conceptualization of the conversational search process between an agent and user, which provides a framework and a starting point for research, development and evaluation of conversational search agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunny Sanyal, Sujay Sanghavi, Alexandros G. Dimakis</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the effectiveness of a simple approach to develop a small base language model (LM) starting from an existing large base LM: first inherit a few transformer blocks from the larger LM, and then train this smaller model on a very small subset (0.1\%) of the raw pretraining data of the larger model. We call our simple recipe Inheritune and first demonstrate it for building a small base LM with 1.5B parameters using 1B tokens (and a starting few layers of larger LM of 3B parameters); we do this using a single A6000 GPU for less than half a day. Across 9 diverse evaluation datasets as well as the MMLU benchmark, the resulting model compares favorably to publicly available base models of 1B-2B size, some of which have been trained using 50-1000 times more tokens.
  We investigate Inheritune in a slightly different setting where we train small LMs utilizing larger LMs and their full pre-training dataset. Here we show that smaller LMs trained utilizing some of the layers of GPT2-medium (355M) and GPT-2-large (770M) can effectively match the val loss of their bigger counterparts when trained from scratch for the same number of training steps on OpenWebText dataset with 9B tokens. We analyze our recipe with extensive experiments and demonstrate it efficacy on diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songyang Han, Sanbao Su, Sihong He, Shuo Han, Haizhao Yang, Shaofeng Zou, Fei Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Various methods for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have been developed with the assumption that agents' policies are based on accurate state information. However, policies learned through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are susceptible to adversarial state perturbation attacks. In this work, we propose a State-Adversarial Markov Game (SAMG) and make the first attempt to investigate different solution concepts of MARL under state uncertainties. Our analysis shows that the commonly used solution concepts of optimal agent policy and robust Nash equilibrium do not always exist in SAMGs. To circumvent this difficulty, we consider a new solution concept called robust agent policy, where agents aim to maximize the worst-case expected state value. We prove the existence of robust agent policy for finite state and finite action SAMGs. Additionally, we propose a Robust Multi-Agent Adversarial Actor-Critic (RMA3C) algorithm to learn robust policies for MARL agents under state uncertainties. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods when faced with state perturbations and greatly improves the robustness of MARL policies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Lu, Wei Li, Yifei Sun, Cheng Song, Yufei Ren, Albert Y. Zomaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has immense potential in time series prediction, but most explainable tools have limited capabilities in providing a systematic understanding of important features over time. These tools typically rely on evaluating a single time point, overlook the time ordering of inputs, and neglect the time-sensitive nature of time series applications. These factors make it difficult for users, particularly those without domain knowledge, to comprehend AI model decisions and obtain meaningful explanations. We propose CGS-Mask, a post-hoc and model-agnostic cellular genetic strip mask-based saliency approach to address these challenges. CGS-Mask uses consecutive time steps as a cohesive entity to evaluate the impact of features on the final prediction, providing binary and sustained feature importance scores over time. Our algorithm optimizes the mask population iteratively to obtain the optimal mask in a reasonable time. We evaluated CGS-Mask on synthetic and real-world datasets, and it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in elucidating the importance of features over time. According to our pilot user study via a questionnaire survey, CGS-Mask is the most effective approach in presenting easily understandable time series prediction results, enabling users to comprehend the decision-making process of AI models with ease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbei Liu, Yu Zhao, Xiao Wang, Lei Geng, Zhitao Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-level contrastive learning, aiming to learn the representations for each graph by contrasting two augmented graphs, has attracted considerable attention. Previous studies usually simply assume that a graph and its augmented graph as a positive pair, otherwise as a negative pair. However, it is well known that graph structure is always complex and multi-scale, which gives rise to a fundamental question: after graph augmentation, will the previous assumption still hold in reality? By an experimental analysis, we discover the semantic information of an augmented graph structure may be not consistent as original graph structure, and whether two augmented graphs are positive or negative pairs is highly related with the multi-scale structures. Based on this finding, we propose a multi-scale subgraph contrastive learning architecture which is able to characterize the fine-grained semantic information. Specifically, we generate global and local views at different scales based on subgraph sampling, and construct multiple contrastive relationships according to their semantic associations to provide richer self-supervised signals. Extensive experiments and parametric analyzes on eight graph classification real-world datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Timothy Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: Simplicity is held by many to be the key to general intelligence. Simpler models tend to "generalise", identifying the cause or generator of data with greater sample efficiency. The implications of the correlation between simplicity and generalisation extend far beyond computer science, addressing questions of physics and even biology. Yet simplicity is a property of form, while generalisation is of function. In interactive settings, any correlation between the two depends on interpretation. In theory there could be no correlation and yet in practice, there is. Previous theoretical work showed generalisation to be a consequence of "weak" constraints implied by function, not form. Experiments demonstrated choosing weak constraints over simple forms yielded a 110-500% improvement in generalisation rate. Here we measure the complexity of weak constraints, and show that if one does not presuppose an abstraction layer, then all have equal complexity. However, in the context of a spatially and temporally extended abstraction layer, efficiency demands weak constraints take simple forms, and simplicity becomes correlated with generalisation. Simplicity has no causal influence on generalisation, but appears to due to confounding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gangshan Jing, He Bai, Jemin George, Aranya Chakrabortty, Piyush K. Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving distributed reinforcement learning (RL) for large-scale cooperative multi-agent systems (MASs) is challenging because: (i) each agent has access to only limited information; (ii) issues on convergence or computational complexity emerge due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a general computationally efficient distributed framework for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by utilizing the structures of graphs involved in this problem. We introduce three coupling graphs describing three types of inter-agent couplings in MARL, namely, the state graph, the observation graph and the reward graph. By further considering a communication graph, we propose two distributed RL approaches based on local value-functions derived from the coupling graphs. The first approach is able to reduce sample complexity significantly under specific conditions on the aforementioned four graphs. The second approach provides an approximate solution and can be efficient even for problems with dense coupling graphs. Here there is a trade-off between minimizing the approximation error and reducing the computational complexity. Simulations show that our RL algorithms have a significantly improved scalability to large-scale MASs compared with centralized and consensus-based distributed RL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael O'Connell, Guanya Shi, Xichen Shi, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Anima Anandkumar, Yisong Yue, Soon-Jo Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Executing safe and precise flight maneuvers in dynamic high-speed winds is important for the ongoing commoditization of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, because the relationship between various wind conditions and its effect on aircraft maneuverability is not well understood, it is challenging to design effective robot controllers using traditional control design methods. We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows rapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through deep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in different wind conditions share a common representation and that the wind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly uses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12 minutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly then uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for mixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions generated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to 43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight control with substantially smaller tracking error than state-of-the-art nonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical performance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness guarantees. Last, our control design extrapolates to unseen wind conditions, is shown to be effective for outdoor flights with only onboard sensors, and can transfer across drones with minimal performance degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: While parameter efficient tuning (PET) methods have shown great potential with transformer architecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness with large-scale ConvNets is still under-studied on Computer Vision (CV) tasks. This paper proposes Conv-Adapter, a PET module designed for ConvNets. Conv-Adapter is light-weight, domain-transferable, and architecture-agnostic with generalized performance on different tasks. When transferring on downstream tasks, Conv-Adapter learns tasks-specific feature modulation to the intermediate representations of backbones while keeping the pre-trained parameters frozen. By introducing only a tiny amount of learnable parameters, e.g., only 3.5% full fine-tuning parameters of ResNet50. It can also be applied for transformer-based backbones. Conv-Adapter outperforms previous PET baseline methods and achieves comparable or surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning on 23 classification tasks of various domains. It also presents superior performance on the few-shot classification with an average margin of 3.39%. Beyond classification, Conv-Adapter can generalize to detection and segmentation tasks with more than 50% reduction of parameters but comparable performance to the traditional full fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyi Li, Rodolfo Corona, Karttikeya Mangalam, Catherine Chen, Daniel Flaherty, Serge Belongie, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Jitendra Malik, Trevor Darrell, Dan Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Are multimodal inputs necessary for grammar induction? Recent work has shown that multimodal training inputs can improve grammar induction. However, these improvements are based on comparisons to weak text-only baselines that were trained on relatively little textual data. To determine whether multimodal inputs are needed in regimes with large amounts of textual training data, we design a stronger text-only baseline, which we refer to as LC-PCFG. LC-PCFG is a C-PFCG that incorporates em-beddings from text-only large language models (LLMs). We use a fixed grammar family to directly compare LC-PCFG to various multi-modal grammar induction methods. We compare performance on four benchmark datasets. LC-PCFG provides an up to 17% relative improvement in Corpus-F1 compared to state-of-the-art multimodal grammar induction methods. LC-PCFG is also more computationally efficient, providing an up to 85% reduction in parameter count and 8.8x reduction in training time compared to multimodal approaches. These results suggest that multimodal inputs may not be necessary for grammar induction, and emphasize the importance of strong vision-free baselines for evaluating the benefit of multimodal approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manon Flageat, Bryan Lim, Antoine Cully</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of fast and massively parallel evaluations in many domains, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, that already proved promising in a large range of applications, have seen their potential multiplied. However, we have yet to understand how to best use a large number of evaluations as using them for random variations alone is not always effective. High-dimensional search spaces are a typical situation where random variations struggle to effectively search. Another situation is uncertain settings where solutions can appear better than they truly are and naively evaluating more solutions might mislead QD algorithms. In this work, we propose MAP-Elites-Multi-ES (MEMES), a novel QD algorithm based on Evolution Strategies (ES) designed to exploit fast parallel evaluations more effectively. MEMES maintains multiple (up to 100) simultaneous ES processes, each with its own independent objective and reset mechanism designed for QD optimisation, all on just a single GPU. We show that MEMES outperforms both gradient-based and mutation-based QD algorithms on black-box optimisation and QD-Reinforcement-Learning tasks, demonstrating its benefit across domains. Additionally, our approach outperforms sampling-based QD methods in uncertain domains when given the same evaluation budget. Overall, MEMES generates reproducible solutions that are high-performing and diverse through large-scale ES optimisation on easily accessible hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kentaro Takemoto, Moyuru Yamada, Tomotake Sasaki, Hisanao Akima</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a task to localize humans and objects in an image and predict the interactions in human-object pairs. In real-world scenarios, HOI detection models need systematic generalization, i.e., generalization to novel combinations of objects and interactions, because the train data are expected to cover a limited portion of all possible combinations. To evaluate the systematic generalization performance of HOI detection models, we created two new sets of HOI detection data splits named HICO-DET-SG and V-COCO-SG based on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, respectively. When evaluated on the new data splits, HOI detection models with various characteristics performed much more poorly than when evaluated on the original splits. This shows that systematic generalization is a challenging goal in HOI detection. By analyzing the evaluation results, we also gain insights for improving the systematic generalization performance and identify four possible future research directions. We hope that our new data splits and presented analysis will encourage further research on systematic generalization in HOI detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Access to pre-trained models has recently emerged as a standard across numerous machine learning domains. Unfortunately, access to the original data the models were trained on may not equally be granted. This makes it tremendously challenging to fine-tune, compress models, adapt continually, or to do any other type of data-driven update. We posit that original data access may however not be required. Specifically, we propose Contrastive Abductive Knowledge Extraction (CAKE), a model-agnostic knowledge distillation procedure that mimics deep classifiers without access to the original data. To this end, CAKE generates pairs of noisy synthetic samples and diffuses them contrastively toward a model's decision boundary. We empirically corroborate CAKE's effectiveness using several benchmark datasets and various architectural choices, paving the way for broad application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowen Wang, Zhengping Che, Yufan Yang, Mingyuan Wang, Zhiyuan Xu, Xiuquan Qiao, Mengshi Qi, Feifei Feng, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Raw depth images captured in indoor scenarios frequently exhibit extensive missing values due to the inherent limitations of the sensors and environments. For example, transparent materials frequently elude detection by depth sensors; surfaces may introduce measurement inaccuracies due to their polished textures, extended distances, and oblique incidence angles from the sensor. The presence of incomplete depth maps imposes significant challenges for subsequent vision applications, prompting the development of numerous depth completion techniques to mitigate this problem. Numerous methods excel at reconstructing dense depth maps from sparse samples, but they often falter when faced with extensive contiguous regions of missing depth values, a prevalent and critical challenge in indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network named RDFC-GAN, which takes a pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to predict a dense and completed depth map. The first branch employs an encoder-decoder structure, by adhering to the Manhattan world assumption and utilizing normal maps from RGB-D information as guidance, to regress the local dense depth values from the raw depth map. The other branch applies an RGB-depth fusion CycleGAN, adept at translating RGB imagery into detailed, textured depth maps while ensuring high fidelity through cycle consistency. We fuse the two branches via adaptive fusion modules named W-AdaIN and train the model with the help of pseudo depth maps. Comprehensive evaluations on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets show that our method significantly enhances depth completion performance particularly in realistic indoor settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may not equitably represent diverse global perspectives on societal issues. In this paper, we develop a quantitative framework to evaluate whose opinions model-generated responses are more similar to. We first build a dataset, GlobalOpinionQA, comprised of questions and answers from cross-national surveys designed to capture diverse opinions on global issues across different countries. Next, we define a metric that quantifies the similarity between LLM-generated survey responses and human responses, conditioned on country. With our framework, we run three experiments on an LLM trained to be helpful, honest, and harmless with Constitutional AI. By default, LLM responses tend to be more similar to the opinions of certain populations, such as those from the USA, and some European and South American countries, highlighting the potential for biases. When we prompt the model to consider a particular country's perspective, responses shift to be more similar to the opinions of the prompted populations, but can reflect harmful cultural stereotypes. When we translate GlobalOpinionQA questions to a target language, the model's responses do not necessarily become the most similar to the opinions of speakers of those languages. We release our dataset for others to use and build on. Our data is at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/llm_global_opinions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Freiberger, Peter Kun, Christian Igel, Anders Sundnes L{\o}vlie, Sebastian Risi</p>
<p>Abstract: Models leveraging both visual and textual data such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), are the backbone of many recent advances in artificial intelligence. In this work, we show that despite their versatility, such models are vulnerable to what we refer to as fooling master images. Fooling master images are capable of maximizing the confidence score of a CLIP model for a significant number of widely varying prompts, while being either unrecognizable or unrelated to the attacked prompts for humans. The existence of such images is problematic as it could be used by bad actors to maliciously interfere with CLIP-trained image retrieval models in production with comparably small effort as a single image can attack many different prompts. We demonstrate how fooling master images for CLIP (CLIPMasterPrints) can be mined using stochastic gradient descent, projected gradient descent, or blackbox optimization. Contrary to many common adversarial attacks, the blackbox optimization approach allows us to mine CLIPMasterPrints even when the weights of the model are not accessible. We investigate the properties of the mined images, and find that images trained on a small number of image captions generalize to a much larger number of semantically related captions. We evaluate possible mitigation strategies, where we increase the robustness of the model and introduce an approach to automatically detect CLIPMasterPrints to sanitize the input of vulnerable models. Finally, we find that vulnerability to CLIPMasterPrints is related to a modality gap in contrastive pre-trained multi-modal networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Cui, Wei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, the objective is almost always defined as a \emph{cumulative} function over the rewards along the process. However, there are many optimal control and reinforcement learning problems in various application fields, especially in communications and networking, where the objectives are not naturally expressed as summations of the rewards. In this paper, we recognize the prevalence of non-cumulative objectives in various problems, and propose a modification to existing algorithms for optimizing such objectives. Specifically, we dive into the fundamental building block for many optimal control and reinforcement learning algorithms: the Bellman optimality equation. To optimize a non-cumulative objective, we replace the original summation operation in the Bellman update rule with a generalized operation corresponding to the objective. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions on the form of the generalized operation as well as assumptions on the Markov decision process under which the globally optimal convergence of the generalized Bellman updates can be guaranteed. We demonstrate the idea experimentally with the bottleneck objective, i.e., the objectives determined by the minimum reward along the process, on classical optimal control and reinforcement learning tasks, as well as on two network routing problems on maximizing the flow rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a commonly used technique to measure neural activation. Its application has been particularly important in identifying underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Autism. Recent analysis of fMRI data models the brain as a graph and extracts features by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the unique characteristics of fMRI data require a special design of GNN. Tailoring GNN to generate effective and domain-explainable features remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive dual-attention block and a differentiable graph pooling method called ContrastPool to better utilize GNN for brain networks, meeting fMRI-specific requirements. We apply our method to 5 resting-state fMRI brain network datasets of 3 diseases and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Our case study confirms that the patterns extracted by our method match the domain knowledge in neuroscience literature, and disclose direct and interesting insights. Our contributions underscore the potential of ContrastPool for advancing the understanding of brain networks and neurodegenerative conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Christian Nauen, Sebastian Palacio, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers come with a high computational cost, yet their effectiveness in addressing problems in language and vision has sparked extensive research aimed at enhancing their efficiency. However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we design a comprehensive benchmark of more than 30 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. This benchmark provides a standardized baseline across the landscape of efficiency-oriented transformers and our framework of analysis, based on Pareto optimality, reveals surprising insights. Despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting transformers or measuring progress of the development of efficient transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hwan Kim, Junghoon Kim, Byung Suk Lee, Sungsu Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph anomaly detection has attracted considerable attention from various domain ranging from network security to finance in recent years. Due to the fact that labeling is very costly, existing methods are predominately developed in an unsupervised manner. However, the detected anomalies may be found out uninteresting instances due to the absence of prior knowledge regarding the anomalies looking for. This issue may be solved by using few labeled anomalies as prior knowledge. In real-world scenarios, we can easily obtain few labeled anomalies. Efficiently leveraging labelled anomalies as prior knowledge is crucial for graph anomaly detection; however, this process remains challenging due to the inherently limited number of anomalies available. To address the problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages metapath to embed actual connectivity patterns between anomalous and normal nodes. To further efficiently exploit context information from metapath-based anomaly subgraph, we present a new framework, Metapath-based Graph Anomaly Detection (MGAD), incorporating GCN layers in both the dual-encoders and decoders to efficiently propagate context information between abnormal and normal nodes. Specifically, MGAD employs GNN-based graph autoencoder as its backbone network. Moreover, dual encoders capture the complex interactions and metapath-based context information between labeled and unlabeled nodes both globally and locally. Through a comprehensive set of experiments conducted on seven real-world networks, this paper demonstrates the superiority of the MGAD method compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Leonhard Buchner, Lele Cao, Jan-Christoph Kalo, Vilhelm von Ehrenheim</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt Tuning is emerging as a scalable and cost-effective method to fine-tune Pretrained Language Models (PLMs), which are often referred to as Large Language Models (LLMs). This study benchmarks the performance and computational efficiency of Prompt Tuning and baselines for multi-label text classification. This is applied to the challenging task of classifying companies into an investment firm's proprietary industry taxonomy, supporting their thematic investment strategy. Text-to-text classification is frequently reported to outperform task-specific classification heads, but has several limitations when applied to a multi-label classification problem where each label consists of multiple tokens: (a) Generated labels may not match any label in the label taxonomy; (b) The fine-tuning process lacks permutation invariance and is sensitive to the order of the provided labels; (c) The model provides binary decisions rather than appropriate confidence scores. Limitation (a) is addressed by applying constrained decoding using Trie Search, which slightly improves classification performance. All limitations (a), (b), and (c) are addressed by replacing the PLM's language head with a classification head, which is referred to as Prompt Tuned Embedding Classification (PTEC). This improves performance significantly, while also reducing computational costs during inference. In our industrial application, the training data is skewed towards well-known companies. We confirm that the model's performance is consistent across both well-known and less-known companies. Our overall results indicate the continuing need to adapt state-of-the-art methods to domain-specific tasks, even in the era of PLMs with strong generalization abilities. We release our codebase and a benchmarking dataset at https://github.com/EQTPartners/PTEC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Shen, Bin Pan, Tianyang Shi, Tao Li, Zhenwei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have become one of the promising approaches for uncertainty estimation due to the solid theorical foundations. However, the performance of BNNs is affected by the ability of catching uncertainty. Instead of only seeking the distribution of neural network weights by in-distribution (ID) data, in this paper, we propose a new Bayesian Neural Network with an Attached structure (ABNN) to catch more uncertainty from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We first construct a mathematical description for the uncertainty of OOD data according to the prior distribution, and then develop an attached Bayesian structure to integrate the uncertainty of OOD data into the backbone network. ABNN is composed of an expectation module and several distribution modules. The expectation module is a backbone deep network which focuses on the original task, and the distribution modules are mini Bayesian structures which serve as attachments of the backbone. In particular, the distribution modules aim at extracting the uncertainty from both ID and OOD data. We further provide theoretical analysis for the convergence of ABNN, and experimentally validate its superiority by comparing with some state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods Code will be made available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our paper presents a robust framework for UWB-based static gesture recognition, leveraging proprietary UWB radar sensor technology. Extensive data collection efforts were undertaken to compile datasets containing five commonly used gestures. Our approach involves a comprehensive data pre-processing pipeline that encompasses outlier handling, aspect ratio-preserving resizing, and false-color image transformation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Heuer</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increase in industrial applications using Answer Set Programming, the need for formal verification tools, particularly for critical applications, has also increased. During the program optimisation process, it would be desirable to have a tool which can automatically verify whether an optimised subprogram can replace the original subprogram. Formally this corresponds to the problem of verifying the strong equivalence of two programs. In order to do so, the translation tool anthem was developed. It can be used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover for classical logic to verify that two programs are strongly equivalent. With the current version of anthem, only the strong equivalence of positive programs with a restricted input language can be verified. This is a result of the translation $\tau^*$ implemented in anthem that produces formulas in the logic of here-and-there, which coincides with classical logic only for positive programs. This thesis extends anthem in order to overcome these limitations. First, the transformation $\sigma^*$ is presented, which transforms formulas from the logic of here-and-there to classical logic. A theorem formalises how $\sigma^*$ can be used to express equivalence in the logic of here-and-there in classical logic. Second, the translation $\tau^*$ is extended to programs containing pools. Another theorem shows how $\sigma^*$ can be combined with $\tau^*$ to express the strong equivalence of two programs in classical logic. With $\sigma^*$ and the extended $\tau^*$, it is possible to express the strong equivalence of logic programs containing negation, simple choices, and pools. Both the extended $\tau^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are implemented in a new version of anthem. Several examples of logic programs containing pools, negation, and simple choice rules, which the new version of anthem can translate to classical logic, are presented. Some a...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ozan \"Ozdenizci, Robert Legenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient alternative to a variety of artificial neural network (ANN) based AI applications. As the progress in neuromorphic computing with SNNs expands their use in applications, the problem of adversarial robustness of SNNs becomes more pronounced. To the contrary of the widely explored end-to-end adversarial training based solutions, we address the limited progress in scalable robust SNN training methods by proposing an adversarially robust ANN-to-SNN conversion algorithm. Our method provides an efficient approach to embrace various computationally demanding robust learning objectives that have been proposed for ANNs. During a post-conversion robust finetuning phase, our method adversarially optimizes both layer-wise firing thresholds and synaptic connectivity weights of the SNN to maintain transferred robustness gains from the pre-trained ANN. We perform experimental evaluations in a novel setting proposed to rigorously assess the robustness of SNNs, where numerous adaptive adversarial attacks that account for the spike-based operation dynamics are considered. Results show that our approach yields a scalable state-of-the-art solution for adversarially robust deep SNNs with low-latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE is non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose a neural refutation framework which performs partial identification of CATE or, equivalently, aims at estimating lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our refutation framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Poppi, Tobia Poppi, Federico Cocchi, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale vision-and-language models, such as CLIP, are typically trained on web-scale data, which can introduce inappropriate content and lead to the development of unsafe and biased behavior. This, in turn, hampers their applicability in sensitive and trustworthy contexts and could raise significant concerns in their adoption. Our research introduces a novel approach to enhancing the safety of vision-and-language models by diminishing their sensitivity to NSFW (not safe for work) inputs. In particular, our methodology seeks to sever "toxic" linguistic and visual concepts, unlearning the linkage between unsafe linguistic or visual items and unsafe regions of the embedding space. We show how this can be done by fine-tuning a CLIP model on synthetic data obtained from a large language model trained to convert between safe and unsafe sentences, and a text-to-image generator. We conduct extensive experiments on the resulting embedding space for cross-modal retrieval, text-to-image, and image-to-text generation, where we show that our model can be remarkably employed with pre-trained generative models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wang, Yuchi Ma, Qunying Huang, Zhengwei Yang, Zhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing technology has become a promising tool in yield prediction. Most prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield prediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single value, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights offered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county at the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed information within a county. In addition, our method addresses the "mixed pixel" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and crop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder accurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to automatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the influence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years in the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83. This paper demonstrates the advantages of our approach from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, through an in-depth study of the relationship between mixed pixels and attention, it is verified that our approach can capture critical feature information while filtering out noise from mixed pixels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their success in language understanding and reasoning on general topics.

In this work, we explore the possibility of fine-tuning an open-sourced LLM into LLM4Causal, which can identify the causal task, execute a corresponding function, and interpret its numerical results based on users' queries and the provided dataset. Meanwhile, we propose a data generation process for more controllable GPT prompting and present two instruction-tuning datasets: (1) Causal-Retrieval-Bench for causal problem identification and input parameter extraction for causal function calling and (2) Causal-Interpret-Bench for in-context causal interpretation. By conducting end-to-end evaluations and two ablation studies, we showed that LLM4Causal can deliver end-to-end solutions for causal problems and provide easy-to-understand answers, which significantly outperforms the baselines.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel two-branch hierarchical model for short-form video humor detection (SVHD), named Comment-aided Video-Language Alignment (CVLA) via data-augmented multi-modal contrastive pre-training. Notably, our CVLA not only operates on raw signals across various modal channels but also yields an appropriate multi-modal representation by aligning the video and language components within a consistent semantic space. The experimental results on two humor detection datasets, including DY11k and UR-FUNNY, demonstrate that CVLA dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art and several competitive baseline approaches.

<p>Abstract: Public acceptance of conditionally automated vehicles is a crucial step in the realization of smart cities. Prior research in Europe has shown that the factors of hedonic motivation, social influence, and performance expectancy, in decreasing order of importance, influence acceptance. Moreover, a generally positive acceptance of the technology was reported. However, there is a lack of information regarding the public acceptance of conditionally automated vehicles in the United States. In this study, we carried out a web-based experiment where participants were provided information regarding the technology and then completed a questionnaire on their perceptions. The collected data was analyzed using PLS-SEM to examine the factors that may lead to public acceptance of the technology in the United States. Our findings showed that social influence, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions determine conditionally automated vehicle acceptance. Additionally, certain factors were found to influence the perception of how useful the technology is, the effort required to use it, and the facilitating conditions for its use. By integrating the insights gained from this study, stakeholders can better facilitate the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology, contributing to safer, more efficient, and user-friendly transportation systems in the future that help realize the vision of the smart city.</p>

<p>Abstract: The aim of SemEval-2024 Task 1, "Semantic Textual Relatedness for African and Asian Languages" is to develop models for identifying semantic textual relatedness (STR) between two sentences using multiple languages (14 African and Asian languages) and settings (supervised, unsupervised, and cross-lingual). Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on several natural language understanding tasks such as multilingual machine translation (MMT), semantic similarity (STS), and encoding sentence embeddings. Using a combination of LLMs that perform well on these tasks, we developed two STR models, $\textit{TranSem}$ and $\textit{FineSem}$, for the supervised and cross-lingual settings. We explore the effectiveness of several training methods and the usefulness of machine translation. We find that direct fine-tuning on the task is comparable to using sentence embeddings and translating to English leads to better performance for some languages. In the supervised setting, our model performance is better than the official baseline for 3 languages with the remaining 4 performing on par. In the cross-lingual setting, our model performance is better than the baseline for 3 languages (leading to $1^{st}$ place for Africaans and $2^{nd}$ place for Indonesian), is on par for 2 languages and performs poorly on the remaining 7 languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Liu, Xi Lin, Zhenkun Wang, Qingfu Zhang, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs), which can be found in numerous real-world applications, have been an important research topic for several decades. Recently, the neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) approach that leverages a learning-based model to solve VRPs without manual algorithm design has gained substantial attention. However, current NCO methods typically require building one model for each routing problem, which significantly hinders their practical application for real-world industry problems with diverse attributes. In this work, we make the first attempt to tackle the crucial challenge of cross-problem generalization. In particular, we formulate VRPs as different combinations of a set of shared underlying attributes and solve them simultaneously via a single model through attribute composition. In this way, our proposed model can successfully solve VRPs with unseen attribute combinations in a zero-shot generalization manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven VRP variants, benchmark datasets, and industry logistic scenarios. The results show that the unified model demonstrates superior performance in the eleven VRPs, reducing the average gap to around 5% from over 20% in the existing approach and achieving a significant performance boost on benchmark datasets as well as a real-world logistics application.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeon Kim, Jeongeun Lee, Yoonho Chang, Chanyeol Choi, Junseong Kim, Jy-yong Sohn</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating hallucination issues is a key challenge that must be overcome to reliably deploy large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. Recently, various methods have been proposed to detect and revise factual errors in LLM-generated texts, in order to reduce hallucination. In this paper, we propose Re-Ex, a method for post-editing LLM-generated responses. Re-Ex introduces a novel reasoning step dubbed as the factual error explanation step. Re-Ex revises the initial response of LLMs using 3-steps : first, external tools are used to retrieve the evidences of the factual errors in the initial LLM response; next, LLM is instructed to explain the problematic parts of the response based on the gathered evidence; finally, LLM revises the initial response using the explanations provided in the previous step. In addition to the explanation step, Re-Ex also incorporates new prompting techniques to reduce the token count and inference time required for the response revision process. Compared with existing methods including FacTool, CoVE, and RARR, Re-Ex provides better detection and revision performance with less inference time and fewer tokens in multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Mu Cai, Bingxin Xu, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant reasoning capabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically use a fixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which increase the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design of the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar to prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which largely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model performance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their similarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned tokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned tokens to supplement their information. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can compress the visual tokens by 18 times on average, and achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Sagnik Mukherjee, Pradhyumna Lavania, Siddhant Singh, Ashutosh Dwivedi, Alham Fikri Aji, Jacki O'Neill, Ashutosh Modi, Monojit Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a survey of 39 recent papers that aim to study cultural representation and inclusion in large language models. We observe that none of the studies define "culture," which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of "culture." We call these aspects the proxies of cultures, and organize them across three dimensions of demographic, semantic and linguistic-cultural interaction proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of "culture," such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness and situatedness of the current methods. Based on these observations, we provide several recommendations for a holistic and practically useful research agenda for furthering cultural inclusion in LLMs and LLM-based applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Wang, Mika V. M\"antyl\"a, Serge Demeyer, Mutlu Beyazit, Joanna Kisaakye, Jesse Nyyss\"ol\"a</p>
<p>Abstract: Microservice-based systems (MSS) may experience failures in various fault categories due to their complex and dynamic nature. To effectively handle failures, AIOps tools utilize trace-based anomaly detection and root cause analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for few-shot abnormal trace classification for MSS. Our framework comprises two main components: (1) Multi-Head Attention Autoencoder for constructing system-specific trace representations, which enables (2) Transformer Encoder-based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to perform effective and efficient few-shot learning for abnormal trace classification. The proposed framework is evaluated on two representative MSS, Trainticket and OnlineBoutique, with open datasets. The results show that our framework can adapt the learned knowledge to classify new, unseen abnormal traces of novel fault categories both within the same system it was initially trained on and even in the different MSS. Within the same MSS, our framework achieves an average accuracy of 93.26\% and 85.2\% across 50 meta-testing tasks for Trainticket and OnlineBoutique, respectively, when provided with 10 instances for each task. In a cross-system context, our framework gets an average accuracy of 92.19\% and 84.77\% for the same meta-testing tasks of the respective system, also with 10 instances provided for each task. Our work demonstrates the applicability of achieving few-shot abnormal trace classification for MSS and shows how it can enable cross-system adaptability. This opens an avenue for building more generalized AIOps tools that require less system-specific data labeling for anomaly detection and root cause analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Cui, Wei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In most applications of utilizing neural networks for mathematical optimization, a dedicated model is trained for each specific optimization objective. However, in many scenarios, several distinct yet correlated objectives or tasks often need to be optimized on the same set of problem inputs. Instead of independently training a different neural network for each problem separately, it would be more efficient to exploit the correlations between these objectives and to train multiple neural network models with shared model parameters and feature representations. To achieve this, this paper first establishes the concept of common information: the shared knowledge required for solving the correlated tasks, then proposes a novel approach for model training by adding into the model an additional reconstruction stage associated with a new reconstruction loss. This loss is for reconstructing the common information starting from a selected hidden layer in the model. The proposed approach encourages the learned features to be general and transferable, and therefore can be readily used for efficient transfer learning. For numerical simulations, three applications are studied: transfer learning on classifying MNIST handwritten digits, the device-to-device wireless network power allocation, and the multiple-input-single-output network downlink beamforming and localization. Simulation results suggest that the proposed approach is highly efficient in data and model complexity, is resilient to over-fitting, and has competitive performances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heitor Rapela Medeiros, Masih Aminbeidokhti, Fidel Guerrero Pena, David Latortue, Eric Granger, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: A common practice in deep learning consists of training large neural networks on massive datasets to perform accurately for different domains and tasks. While this methodology may work well in numerous application areas, it only applies across modalities due to a larger distribution shift in data captured using different sensors. This paper focuses on the problem of adapting a large object detection model to one or multiple modalities while being efficient. To do so, we propose ModTr as an alternative to the common approach of fine-tuning large models. ModTr consists of adapting the input with a small transformation network trained to minimize the detection loss directly. The original model can therefore work on the translated inputs without any further change or fine-tuning to its parameters. Experimental results on translating from IR to RGB images on two well-known datasets show that this simple ModTr approach provides detectors that can perform comparably or better than the standard fine-tuning without forgetting the original knowledge. This opens the doors to a more flexible and efficient service-based detection pipeline in which, instead of using a different detector for each modality, a unique and unaltered server is constantly running, where multiple modalities with the corresponding translations can query it.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Athanasios Karapantelakis, Mukesh Thakur, Alexandros Nikou, Farnaz Moradi, Christian Orlog, Fitsum Gaim, Henrik Holm, Doumitrou Daniil Nimara, Vincent Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has successfully introduced standards for global mobility. However, the volume and complexity of these standards has increased over time, thus complicating access to relevant information for vendors and service providers. Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), may provide faster access to relevant information. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of state-of-art LLMs to be used as Question Answering (QA) assistants for 3GPP document reference. Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide a benchmark and measuring methods for evaluating performance of LLMs. Second, we do data preprocessing and fine-tuning for one of these LLMs and provide guidelines to increase accuracy of the responses that apply to all LLMs. Third, we provide a model of our own, TeleRoBERTa, that performs on-par with foundation LLMs but with an order of magnitude less number of parameters. Results show that LLMs can be used as a credible reference tool on telecom technical documents, and thus have potential for a number of different applications from troubleshooting and maintenance, to network operations and software product development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Peng, Xuyang Wu, Qifan Wang, Sravanthi Rajanala, Yi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been extensively utilized in Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the down-streaming tasks without the cost of fine-tuing the whole LLMs. Recent studies have shown how to effectively use PEFT for fine-tuning LLMs in ranking tasks with convincing performance; there are some limitations, including the learned prompt being fixed for different documents, overfitting to specific tasks, and low adaptation ability. In this paper, we introduce a query-dependent parameter efficient fine-tuning (Q-PEFT) approach for text reranking to leak the information of the true queries to LLMs and then make the generation of true queries from input documents much easier. Specifically, we utilize the query to extract the top-$k$ tokens from concatenated documents, serving as contextual clues. We further augment Q-PEFT by substituting the retrieval mechanism with a multi-head attention layer to achieve end-to-end training and cover all the tokens in the documents, guiding the LLMs to generate more document-specific synthetic queries, thereby further improving the reranking performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06407">Rethinking How to Evaluate Language Model Jailbreak</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu Cai, Arjun Arunasalam, Leo Y. Lin, Antonio Bianchi, Z. Berkay Celik</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not. In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods. Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06710">SpikeNVS: Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from Blurry Images via Spike Camera</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaole Dai, Zhenyu Wang, Qinwen Xu, Ming Lu, Wen Chen, Boxin Shi, Shanghang Zhang, Tiejun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most critical factors in achieving sharp Novel View Synthesis (NVS) using neural field methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the quality of the training images. However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur. In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data. Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS. The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background. Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations. By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss. Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs. It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously. We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS. The code and dataset will be made available for public access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tien-Hong Lo, Fu-An Chao, Tzu-I Wu, Yao-Ting Sung, Berlin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) typically involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) and hand-crafted feature extraction from the ASR transcript of a learner's speech. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown stellar performance compared to traditional methods. However, SSL-based ASA systems are faced with at least three data-related challenges: limited annotated data, uneven distribution of learner proficiency levels and non-uniform score intervals between different CEFR proficiency levels. To address these challenges, we explore the use of two novel modeling strategies: metric-based classification and loss reweighting, leveraging distinct SSL-based embedding features. Extensive experimental results on the ICNALE benchmark dataset suggest that our approach can outperform existing strong baselines by a sizable margin, achieving a significant improvement of more than 10% in CEFR prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanpei Li, Elia Piccoli, Andrea Cossu, Davide Bacciu, Vincenzo Lomonaco</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) focuses on maximizing the predictive performance of a model across a non-stationary stream of data. Unfortunately, CL models tend to forget previous knowledge, thus often underperforming when compared with an offline model trained jointly on the entire data stream. Given that any CL model will eventually make mistakes, it is of crucial importance to build calibrated CL models: models that can reliably tell their confidence when making a prediction. Model calibration is an active research topic in machine learning, yet to be properly investigated in CL. We provide the first empirical study of the behavior of calibration approaches in CL, showing that CL strategies do not inherently learn calibrated models. To mitigate this issue, we design a continual calibration approach that improves the performance of post-processing calibration methods over a wide range of different benchmarks and CL strategies. CL does not necessarily need perfect predictive models, but rather it can benefit from reliable predictive models. We believe our study on continual calibration represents a first step towards this direction.</p>
