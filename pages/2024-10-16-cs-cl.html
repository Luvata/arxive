<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyam Sharma, Divya Santhanam</p>
<p>Abstract: Writing stories is an engaging yet challenging endeavor. Often, authors encounter moments of creative block, where the path forward in their narrative becomes obscured. This paper is designed to address such moments by providing an innovative solution: A tool that completes stories based on given prompts. By inputting a short story prompt, users can receive a conclusion to their story, articulated in one sentence or more, thereby enhancing the storytelling process with AI-driven creativity. This tool aims not only to assist authors in navigating writer's block but also to offer a fun and interactive way for anyone to expand on story ideas spontaneously. Through this paper, we explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative writing, pushing the boundaries of how stories can be crafted and concluded. To create our final text-generation models, we used a pre-trained GPT-3.5 model and a newly created finetuned SSM-Mamba model, both of which perform well on a comprehensive list of metrics including BERT score, METEOR, BLEU, ROUGE, and Perplexity. The SSM model has also been made public for the NLP community on HuggingFace models as an open source contribution, which for the timebeing is a first of its kind state-space model for story-generation task on HuggingFace.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toluwani Aremu, Oluwakemi Akinwehinmi, Chukwuemeka Nwagu, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Rita Orji, Pedro Arnau Del Amo, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate and observe the behaviour and performance of Large Language Model (LLM)-backed chatbots in addressing misinformed prompts and questions with demographic information within the domains of Climate Change and Mental Health. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we assess the chatbots' ability to discern the veracity of statements, their adherence to facts, and the presence of bias or misinformation in their responses. Our quantitative analysis using True/False questions reveals that these chatbots can be relied on to give the right answers to these close-ended questions. However, the qualitative insights, gathered from domain experts, shows that there are still concerns regarding privacy, ethical implications, and the necessity for chatbots to direct users to professional services. We conclude that while these chatbots hold significant promise, their deployment in sensitive areas necessitates careful consideration, ethical oversight, and rigorous refinement to ensure they serve as a beneficial augmentation to human expertise rather than an autonomous solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Connor Walker, Callum Rothon, Koorosh Aslansefat, Yiannis Papadopoulos, Nina Dethlefs</p>
<p>Abstract: The Offshore Wind (OSW) industry is experiencing significant expansion, resulting in increased Operations \& Maintenance (O\&M) costs. Intelligent alarm systems offer the prospect of swift detection of component failures and process anomalies, enabling timely and precise interventions that could yield reductions in resource expenditure, as well as scheduled and unscheduled downtime. This paper introduces an innovative approach to tackle this challenge by capitalising on Large Language Models (LLMs). We present a specialised conversational agent that incorporates statistical techniques to calculate distances between sentences for the detection and filtering of hallucinations and unsafe output. This potentially enables improved interpretation of alarm sequences and the generation of safer repair action recommendations by the agent. Preliminary findings are presented with the approach applied to ChatGPT-4 generated test sentences. The limitation of using ChatGPT-4 and the potential for enhancement of this agent through re-training with specialised OSW datasets are discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shramay Palta, Nishant Balepur, Peter Rankel, Sarah Wiegreffe, Marine Carpuat, Rachel Rudinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Questions involving commonsense reasoning about everyday situations often admit many $\textit{possible}$ or $\textit{plausible}$ answers. In contrast, multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks for commonsense reasoning require a hard selection of a single correct answer, which, in principle, should represent the $\textit{most}$ plausible answer choice. On $250$ MCQ items sampled from two commonsense reasoning benchmarks, we collect $5,000$ independent plausibility judgments on answer choices. We find that for over 20% of the sampled MCQs, the answer choice rated most plausible does not match the benchmark gold answers; upon manual inspection, we confirm that this subset exhibits higher rates of problems like ambiguity or semantic mismatch between question and answer choices. Experiments with LLMs reveal low accuracy and high variation in performance on the subset, suggesting our plausibility criterion may be helpful in identifying more reliable benchmark items for commonsense evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Are Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stochastic parrots? Do they genuinely understand and are capable of performing the tasks they excel at? This paper aims to explore the fundamental basis of MLLMs, i.e. core cognitive abilities that human intelligence builds upon to perceive, comprehend, and reason. To this end, we propose CogDevelop2K, a comprehensive benchmark that spans 12 sub-concepts from fundamental knowledge like object permanence and boundary to advanced reasoning like intentionality understanding, structured via the developmental trajectory of a human mind. We evaluate 46 MLLMs on our benchmarks. Comprehensively, we further evaluate the influence of evaluation strategies and prompting techniques. Surprisingly, we observe a reversed cognitive developmental trajectory compared to humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Huang, Zhiyuan Ma, Jintao Du, Changhua Meng, Weiqiang Wang, Zhouhan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Consistency, a widely-used decoding strategy, significantly boosts the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it depends on the plurality voting rule, which focuses on the most frequent answer while overlooking all other minority responses. These inconsistent minority views often illuminate areas of uncertainty within the model's generation process. To address this limitation, we present Mirror-Consistency, an enhancement of the standard Self-Consistency approach. Our method incorporates a 'reflective mirror' into the self-ensemble decoding process and enables LLMs to critically examine inconsistencies among multiple generations. Additionally, just as humans use the mirror to better understand themselves, we propose using Mirror-Consistency to enhance the sample-based confidence calibration methods, which helps to mitigate issues of overconfidence. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mirror-Consistency yields superior performance in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration compared to Self-Consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yew Ken Chia, Guizhen Chen, Weiwen Xu, Luu Anh Tuan, Soujanya Poria, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced models such as OpenAI o1 exhibit impressive problem-solving capabilities through step-by-step reasoning. However, they may still falter on more complex problems, making errors that disrupt their reasoning paths. We attribute this to the expansive solution space, where each step has the risk of diverging into mistakes. To enhance language model reasoning, we introduce a specialized training framework called Reasoning Paths Optimization (RPO), which enables learning to reason and explore from diverse paths. Our approach encourages favorable branches at each reasoning step while penalizing unfavorable ones, enhancing the model's overall problem-solving performance. Reasoning Paths Optimization does not rely on large-scale human-annotated rationales or outputs from closed-source models, making it scalable and data-efficient. We focus on multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and science-based exam questions. The experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the reasoning performance of large language models, with up to 3.1% and 4.3% improvement on GSM8K and MMLU (STEM) respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Zeng, Yingyu Shan, Zeming Liu, Jiashu Yao, Yuhang Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant effort to align large language models with human preferences.

Building on prior work, we present a method for generating a synthetic general instruction-following dataset, along with safety data. Through extensive evaluations and benchmarks, we fine-tuned a llama-3-8B-instruct model and demonstrated that we can enhance it's performance significantly to match huge closed-source models like GPT-4o while making it safer and more compliant. We open-source the model, data and code to support further development and research in the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Dandekar (University of California, Santa Barbara), Wenda Xu (University of California, Santa Barbara), Xi Xu (Carnegie Mellon University), Siqi Ouyang (Carnegie Mellon University), Lei Li (Carnegie Mellon University)</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine translation research, evaluation toolkits have become essential for benchmarking system progress. Tools like COMET and SacreBLEU offer single quality score assessments that are effective for pairwise system comparisons. However, these tools provide limited insights for fine-grained system-level comparisons and the analysis of instance-level defects. To address these limitations, we introduce Translation Canvas, an explainable interface designed to pinpoint and analyze translation systems' performance: 1) Translation Canvas assists machine translation researchers in comprehending system-level model performance by identifying common errors (their frequency and severity) and analyzing relationships between different systems based on various evaluation metrics. 2) It supports fine-grained analysis by highlighting error spans with explanations and selectively displaying systems' predictions. According to human evaluation, Translation Canvas demonstrates superior performance over COMET and SacreBLEU packages under enjoyability and understandability criteria.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10862">Superficial Safety Alignment Hypothesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianwei Li, Jung-Eun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are overwhelmingly more and more integrated into various applications, ensuring they generate safe and aligned responses is a pressing need. Previous research on alignment has largely focused on general instruction-following but has often overlooked the unique properties and challenges of safety alignment, such as the brittleness of safety mechanisms. To bridge the gap, we propose the Superficial Safety Alignment Hypothesis (SSAH), which posits that safety alignment should teach an otherwise unsafe model to choose the correct reasoning direction - interpreted as a specialized binary classification task - and incorporate a refusal mechanism with multiple reserved fallback options. Furthermore, through SSAH, we hypothesize that safety guardrails in LLMs can be established by just a small number of essential components. To verify this, we conduct an ablation study and successfully identify four types of attribute-critical components in safety-aligned LLMs: Exclusive Safety Unit (ESU), Exclusive Utility Unit (EUU), Complex Unit (CU), and Redundant Unit (RU). Our findings show that freezing certain safety-critical components 7.5\% during fine-tuning allows the model to retain its safety attributes while adapting to new tasks. Additionally, we show that leveraging redundant units 20\% in the pre-trained model as an ``alignment budget'' can effectively minimize the alignment tax while achieving the alignment goal. All considered, this paper concludes that the atomic functional unit for safety in LLMs is at the neuron level and underscores that safety alignment should not be complicated. We believe this work contributes to the foundation of efficient and scalable safety alignment for future LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text and exhibiting personality traits similar to those in humans. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs encode and express traits such as agreeableness and impulsiveness remain poorly understood. Drawing on the theory of social determinism, we investigate how long-term background factors, such as family environment and cultural norms, interact with short-term pressures like external instructions, shaping and influencing LLMs' personality traits. By steering the output of LLMs through the utilization of interpretable features within the model, we explore how these background and pressure factors lead to changes in the model's traits without the need for further fine-tuning. Additionally, we suggest the potential impact of these factors on model safety from the perspective of personality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Ba, Michelle V. Mancenido, Rong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models continue to swiftly advance, calibrating their performance has become a major concern prior to practical and widespread implementation. Most existing calibration methods often negatively impact model accuracy due to the lack of diversity of validation data, resulting in reduced generalizability. To address this, we propose a calibration method that incorporates synthetic data without compromising accuracy. We derive the expected calibration error (ECE) bound using the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework. Large language models (LLMs), known for their ability to mimic real data and generate text with mixed class labels, are utilized as a synthetic data generation strategy to lower the ECE bound and improve model accuracy on real test data. Additionally, we propose data generation mechanisms for efficient calibration. Testing our method on four different natural language processing tasks, we observed an average up to 34\% increase in accuracy and 33\% decrease in ECE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Guo, Zilin Du, Boyang Li, Chunyan Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: A major limitation of prompt tuning is its dependence on large labeled training datasets. Under few-shot learning settings, prompt tuning lags far behind full-model fine-tuning, limiting its scope of application. In this paper, we leverage the powerful LLMs to synthesize task-specific labeled data for training the soft prompts. We first introduce a distribution-aligned weighted generator tuning (DawGen) method to encourage generating in-distribution data that aligns with the few-shot real data. Then, we train soft prompts on both synthetic and real datasets using a gradient surgery approach, which eliminates the conflicting gradients from different data sources. Experiments on seven sentence-pair classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for boosting prompt tuning in few-shot learning settings. Results on QQP, MRPC, and SICK datasets are even comparable to the performance of transfer learning from large real-world datasets, showing the promise of synthetic data as an alternative for enhancing soft prompt tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YuXuan Wu, Bonaventure F. P. Dossou, Dianbo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer extensive knowledge across various domains, but they may inadvertently memorize sensitive, unauthorized, or malicious data, such as personal information in the medical and financial sectors. Machine unlearning methods aim to remove specific information from models after training to address this. However, current approaches require additional model training or struggle to effectively erase particular data points and their associated context due to LLMs' complex, dense, and continuous nature. In this study, we propose a novel amortized unlearning approach using codebook features and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). By leveraging a bottleneck to decompose the activation space and regulate information flow, our method efficiently unlearns targeted information while preserving the model's performance on unrelated data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that successfully enables unlearning specific topics with contextual relevance in an LLM, marking a significant step towards real-world applications of machine unlearning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic metrics are used as proxies to evaluate abstractive summarization systems when human annotations are too expensive. To be useful, these metrics should be fine-grained, show a high correlation with human annotations, and ideally be independent of reference quality; however, most standard evaluation metrics for summarization are reference-based, and existing reference-free metrics correlate poorly with relevance, especially on summaries of longer documents. In this paper, we introduce a reference-free metric that correlates well with human evaluated relevance, while being very cheap to compute. We show that this metric can also be used alongside reference-based metrics to improve their robustness in low quality reference settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryota Tozuka, Hisashi Johno, Akitomo Amakawa, Junichi Sato, Mizuki Muto, Shoichiro Seki, Atsushi Komaba, Hiroshi Onishi</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: In radiology, large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, have recently gained attention, and their utility is being rapidly evaluated. However, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in clinical applications due to limitations such as hallucinations and insufficient referencing. To address these issues, we focus on the latest technology, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enables LLMs to reference reliable external knowledge (REK). Specifically, this study examines the utility and reliability of a recently released RAG-equipped LLM (RAG-LLM), NotebookLM, for staging lung cancer.
  Materials and methods: We summarized the current lung cancer staging guideline in Japan and provided this as REK to NotebookLM. We then tasked NotebookLM with staging 100 fictional lung cancer cases based on CT findings and evaluated its accuracy. For comparison, we performed the same task using a gold-standard LLM, GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o), both with and without the REK.
  Results: NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy in the lung cancer staging experiment, outperforming GPT-4o, which recorded 39% accuracy with the REK and 25% without it. Moreover, NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in searching reference locations within the REK.
  Conclusion: NotebookLM successfully performed lung cancer staging by utilizing the REK, demonstrating superior performance compared to GPT-4o. Additionally, it provided highly accurate reference locations within the REK, allowing radiologists to efficiently evaluate the reliability of NotebookLM's responses and detect possible hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights the potential of NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, in image diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan, Pingzhi Li, Sukwon Yun, Zhenyu Wang, Shahriar Nirjon, Chau-Wai Wong, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape the AI landscape, fine-tuning pretrained models has become more popular than in the pre-LLM era for achieving optimal performance in domain-specific tasks. However, pretrained LLMs such as ChatGPT are periodically evolved, i.e., model parameters are frequently updated), making it challenging for downstream users with limited resources to keep up with fine-tuning the newest LLMs for their domain application. Even though fine-tuning costs have nowadays been reduced thanks to the innovations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA, not all downstream users have adequate computing for frequent personalization. Moreover, access to fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, could be time-restrictive, making it crucial to retain the knowledge encoded in earlier fine-tuned rounds for future adaptation. In this paper, we present PortLLM, a training-free framework that (i) creates an initial lightweight model update patch to capture domain-specific knowledge, and (ii) allows a subsequent seamless plugging for the continual personalization of evolved LLM at minimal cost. Our extensive experiments cover seven representative datasets, from easier question-answering tasks {BoolQ, SST2} to harder reasoning tasks {WinoGrande, GSM8K}, and models including {Mistral-7B, Llama2, Llama3.1, and Gemma2}, validating the portability of our designed model patches and showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For instance, PortLLM achieves comparable performance to LoRA fine-tuning with reductions of up to 12.2x in GPU memory usage. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications to understand the portability of our model update patches, which offers new insights into the theoretical dimension of LLMs' personalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Lermen, Mateusz Dziemian, Govind Pimpale</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, language models like Llama 3.1 Instruct have become increasingly capable of agentic behavior, enabling them to perform tasks requiring short-term planning and tool use. In this study, we apply refusal-vector ablation to Llama 3.1 70B and implement a simple agent scaffolding to create an unrestricted agent. Our findings imply that these refusal-vector ablated models can successfully complete harmful tasks, such as bribing officials or crafting phishing attacks, revealing significant vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms. To further explore this, we introduce a small Safe Agent Benchmark, designed to test both harmful and benign tasks in agentic scenarios. Our results imply that safety fine-tuning in chat models does not generalize well to agentic behavior, as we find that Llama 3.1 Instruct models are willing to perform most harmful tasks without modifications. At the same time, these models will refuse to give advice on how to perform the same tasks when asked for a chat completion. This highlights the growing risk of misuse as models become more capable, underscoring the need for improved safety frameworks for language model agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenchao Jin, Mengchen Liu, Dongdong Chen, Lingting Zhu, Yunsheng Li, Lequan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Through the integration of external tools, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 significantly expand their functional capabilities, evolving from elementary conversational agents to general-purpose assistants. We argue that the primary drivers of these advancements are the quality and diversity of the training data. However, the existing LLMs with external tool integration provide only limited transparency regarding their datasets and data collection methods, which has led to the initiation of this research. Specifically, in this paper, our objective is to elucidate the detailed process involved in constructing datasets that empower LLMs to effectively learn how to utilize external tools and make this information available to the public through the introduction of ToolBridge. ToolBridge proposes to employ a collection of general open-access datasets as its raw dataset pool and applies a series of strategies to identify appropriate data entries from the pool for external tool API insertions. By supervised fine-tuning on these curated data entries, LLMs can invoke external tools in appropriate contexts to boost their predictive accuracy, particularly for basic functions including data processing, numerical computation, and factual retrieval. Our experiments rigorously isolates model architectures and training configurations, focusing exclusively on the role of data. The experimental results indicate that LLMs trained on ToolBridge demonstrate consistent performance improvements on both standard benchmarks and custom evaluation datasets. All the associated code and data will be open-source at https://github.com/CharlesPikachu/ToolBridge, promoting transparency and facilitating the broader community to explore approaches for equipping LLMs with external tools capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajia Huang, Haoran Zhu, Chao Xu, Tianming Zhan, Qianqian Xie, Jimin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent auditing represents a crucial advancement in modern audit practices, enhancing both the quality and efficiency of audits within the realm of artificial intelligence. With the rise of large language model (LLM), there is enormous potential for intelligent models to contribute to audit domain. However, general LLMs applied in audit domain face the challenges of lacking specialized knowledge and the presence of data biases. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces AuditWen, an open-source audit LLM by fine-tuning Qwen with constructing instruction data from audit domain. We first outline the application scenarios for LLMs in the audit and extract requirements that shape the development of LLMs tailored for audit purposes. We then propose an audit LLM, called AuditWen, by fine-tuning Qwen with constructing 28k instruction dataset from 15 audit tasks and 3 layers. In evaluation stage, we proposed a benchmark with 3k instructions that covers a set of critical audit tasks derived from the application scenarios. With the benchmark, we compare AuditWen with other existing LLMs from information extraction, question answering and document generation. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of AuditWen both in question understanding and answer generation, making it an immediately valuable tool for audit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyang Wang, Qiaozhi Bao, Zixuan Wang, Yanlin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This article improves the Transformer model based on swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, aiming to predict the emotions of employment related text content on American social media. Through text preprocessing, feature extraction, and vectorization, the text data was successfully converted into numerical data and imported into the model for training. The experimental results show that during the training process, the accuracy of the model gradually increased from 49.27% to 82.83%, while the loss value decreased from 0.67 to 0.35, indicating a significant improvement in the performance of the model on the training set. According to the confusion matrix analysis of the training set, the accuracy of the training set is 86.15%. The confusion matrix of the test set also showed good performance, with an accuracy of 82.91%. The accuracy difference between the training set and the test set is only 3.24%, indicating that the model has strong generalization ability. In addition, the evaluation of polygon results shows that the model performs well in classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC), with a Kappa coefficient of 0.66 and an F-measure of 0.80, further verifying the effectiveness of the model in social media sentiment analysis. The improved model proposed in this article not only improves the accuracy of sentiment recognition in employment related texts on social media, but also has important practical significance. This social media based data analysis method can not only capture social dynamics in a timely manner, but also promote decision-makers to pay attention to public concerns and provide data support for improving employment conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Xu, Kun Zhang, Victor S. Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating highly coherent and contextually relevant text introduces new risks, including misuse for unethical purposes such as disinformation or academic dishonesty. To address these challenges, we propose FreqMark, a novel watermarking technique that embeds detectable frequency-based watermarks in LLM-generated text during the token sampling process. The method leverages periodic signals to guide token selection, creating a watermark that can be detected with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis. This approach enables accurate identification of LLM-generated content, even in mixed-text scenarios with both human-authored and LLM-generated segments. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness and precision of FreqMark, showing strong detection capabilities against various attack scenarios such as paraphrasing and token substitution. Results show that FreqMark achieves an AUC improvement of up to 0.98, significantly outperforming existing detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong Pang, Jiaheng Wei, Ankit Parag Shah, Zhaowei Zhu, Yaxuan Wang, Chen Qian, Yang Liu, Yujia Bao, Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is critical for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, and recent studies have demonstrated that small amounts of human-curated data can outperform larger datasets, challenging traditional data scaling laws. While LLM-based data quality rating systems offer a cost-effective alternative to human annotation, they often suffer from inaccuracies and biases, even in powerful models like GPT-4. In this work, we introduce DS2, a Diversity-aware Score curation method for Data Selection. By systematically modeling error patterns through a score transition matrix, DS2 corrects LLM-based scores and promotes diversity in the selected data samples. Our approach shows that a curated subset (just 3.3% of the original dataset) outperforms full-scale datasets (300k samples) across various machine-alignment benchmarks, and matches or surpasses human-aligned datasets such as LIMA with the same sample size (1k samples). These findings challenge conventional data scaling assumptions, highlighting that redundant, low-quality samples can degrade performance and reaffirming that "more can be less."</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxiong Gao, Yutong Wang, Jiedong Jiang, Qi Gao, Zihan Qin, Tianyi Xu, Bin Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Verifiable formal languages like Lean have profoundly impacted mathematical reasoning, particularly through the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated reasoning. A significant challenge in training LLMs for these formal languages is the lack of parallel datasets that align natural language with formal language proofs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel framework for translating the Mathlib4 corpus (a unified library of mathematics in formal language Lean 4) into natural language. Building upon this, we employ a dual augmentation strategy that combines tactic-based and informal-based approaches, leveraging the Lean-jixia system, a Lean 4 analyzer. We present the results of this pipeline on Mathlib4 as Herald (Hierarchy and Retrieval-based Translated Lean Dataset). We also propose the Herald Translator, which is fine-tuned on Herald. Herald translator achieves a 93.2% accuracy (Pass@128) on formalizing statements in the miniF2F-test and a 22.5% accuracy on our internal graduate-level textbook dataset, outperforming InternLM2-Math-Plus-7B (74.0% and 7.5%) and TheoremLlama (50.1% and 4.0%). Furthermore, we propose a section-level translation framework for real-world applications. As a direct application of Herald translator, we have successfully translated a template section in the Stack project, marking a notable progress in the automatic formalization of graduate-level mathematical literature. Our model, along with the datasets, will be open-sourced to the public soon.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10880">Fine-tuning can Help Detect Pretraining Data from Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengxiang Zhang, Songxin Zhang, Bingyi Jing, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), detecting pretraining data has been increasingly important due to concerns about fair evaluation and ethical risks. Current methods differentiate members and non-members by designing scoring functions, like Perplexity and Min-k%. However, the diversity and complexity of training data magnifies the difficulty of distinguishing, leading to suboptimal performance in detecting pretraining data. In this paper, we first explore the benefits of unseen data, which can be easily collected after the release of the LLM. We find that the perplexities of LLMs perform differently for members and non-members, after fine-tuning with a small amount of previously unseen data. In light of this, we introduce a novel and effective method termed Fine-tuned Score Deviation (FSD), which improves the performance of current scoring functions for pretraining data detection. In particular, we propose to measure the deviation distance of current scores after fine-tuning on a small amount of unseen data within the same domain. In effect, using a few unseen data can largely decrease the scores of all non-members, leading to a larger deviation distance than members. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, significantly improving the AUC score on common benchmark datasets across various models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanouil Zaranis, Giuseppe Attanasio, Sweta Agrawal, Andr\'e F. T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: The automatic assessment of translation quality has recently become crucial for many stages of the translation pipeline, from data curation to training and decoding. However, while quality estimation metrics have been optimized to align with human judgments, no attention has been given to these metrics' potential biases, particularly in reinforcing visibility and usability for some demographic groups over others. This paper is the first to investigate gender bias in quality estimation (QE) metrics and its downstream impact on machine translation (MT). We focus on out-of-English translations where the target language uses grammatical gender. We ask: (RQ1) Do contemporary QE metrics exhibit gender bias? (RQ2) Can the use of contextual information mitigate this bias? (RQ3) How does QE influence gender bias in MT outputs? Experiments with state-of-the-art QE metrics across multiple domains, datasets, and languages reveal significant bias. Masculine-inflected translations score higher than feminine-inflected ones, and gender-neutral translations are penalized. Moreover, context-aware QE metrics reduce errors for masculine-inflected references but fail to address feminine referents, exacerbating gender disparities. Additionally, we show that QE metrics can perpetuate gender bias in MT systems when used in quality-aware decoding. Our findings highlight the need to address gender bias in QE metrics to ensure equitable and unbiased MT systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11001">Graph of Records: Boosting Retrieval Augmented Generation for Long-context Summarization with Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhen Zhang, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has revitalized Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting non-parametric factual knowledge. Compared with long-context LLMs, RAG is considered an effective summarization tool in a more concise and lightweight manner, which can interact with LLMs multiple times using diverse queries to get comprehensive responses. However, the LLM-generated historical responses, which contain potentially insightful information, are largely neglected and discarded by existing approaches, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose \textit{graph of records} (\textbf{GoR}), which leverages historical responses generated by LLMs to enhance RAG for long-context global summarization. Inspired by the \textit{retrieve-then-generate} paradigm of RAG, we construct a graph by establishing an edge between the retrieved text chunks and the corresponding LLM-generated response. To further uncover the intricate correlations between them, GoR further features a \textit{graph neural network} and an elaborately designed \textit{BERTScore}-based objective for self-supervised model training, enabling seamless supervision signal backpropagation between reference summaries and node embeddings. We comprehensively compare GoR with 12 baselines across four long-context summarization datasets, and the results indicate that our proposed method reaches the best performance e.g., 15\%, 8\%, and 19\% improvement over retrievers w.r.t. Rouge-L, Rouge-1, and Rouge-2 on the WCEP dataset). Extensive experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of GoR. Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GoR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangru Lin, Shaoguang Mao, Emanuele La Malfa, Valentin Hofmann, Adrian de Wynter, Jing Yao, Si-Qing Chen, Michael Wooldridge, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Language is not monolithic. While many benchmarks are used as proxies to systematically estimate Large Language Models' (LLM) performance in real-life tasks, they tend to ignore the nuances of within-language variation and thus fail to model the experience of speakers of minority dialects. Focusing on African American Vernacular English (AAVE), we present the first study on LLMs' fairness and robustness to a dialect in canonical reasoning tasks (algorithm, math, logic, and comprehensive reasoning). We hire AAVE speakers, including experts with computer science backgrounds, to rewrite seven popular benchmarks, such as HumanEval and GSM8K. The result of this effort is ReDial, a dialectal benchmark comprising $1.2K+$ parallel query pairs in Standardized English and AAVE. We use ReDial to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o/4/3.5-turbo, LLaMA-3.1/3, Mistral, and Phi-3. We find that, compared to Standardized English, almost all of these widely used models show significant brittleness and unfairness to queries in AAVE. Furthermore, AAVE queries can degrade performance more substantially than misspelled texts in Standardized English, even when LLMs are more familiar with the AAVE queries. Finally, asking models to rephrase questions in Standardized English does not close the performance gap but generally introduces higher costs. Overall, our findings indicate that LLMs provide unfair service to dialect users in complex reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdellah El Mekki, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, primarily through in-context learning (ICL). In ICL, the LLM is provided with examples that represent a given task such that it learns to generate answers for test inputs. However, access to these in-context examples is not guaranteed especially for low-resource or massively multilingual tasks. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach to mine in-context examples for machine translation (MT), enabling unsupervised MT (UMT) across different languages. Our approach begins with word-level mining to acquire word translations that are then used to perform sentence-level mining. As the quality of mined parallel pairs may not be optimal due to noise or mistakes, we introduce a filtering criterion to select the optimal in-context examples from a pool of unsupervised parallel sentences. We evaluate our approach using two multilingual LLMs on 288 directions from the FLORES-200 dataset and analyze the impact of various linguistic features on performance. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our unsupervised approach in mining in-context examples for MT, leading to better or comparable translation performance as translation with regular in-context samples (extracted from human-annotated data), while also outperforming the other state-of-the-art UMT methods by an average of $7$ BLEU points.</p>

Previous studies have proposed different strategies for automatically generated counterspeech. Evaluations, however, focus on the relevance, surface form, and other shallow linguistic characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the human likeness of AI-generated counterspeech, a critical factor influencing effectiveness. We implement and evaluate several LLM-based generation strategies, and discover that AI-generated and human-written counterspeech can be easily distinguished by both simple classifiers and humans.

<p>Abstract: AI-mediated communication enables users to communicate more quickly and efficiently. Various systems have been proposed such as smart reply and AI-assisted writing. Yet, the heterogeneity of the forms of inputs and architectures often renders it challenging to combine insights from user behaviour in one system to improve performance in another. In this work, we consider the case where the user does not select any of the suggested replies from a smart reply system, and how this can be used as one-shot implicit negative feedback to enhance the accuracy of an AI writing model. We introduce Nifty, an approach that uses classifier guidance to controllably integrate implicit user feedback into the text generation process. Empirically, we find up to 34% improvement in Rouge-L, 89% improvement in generating the correct intent, and an 86% win-rate according to human evaluators compared to a vanilla AI writing system on the MultiWOZ and Schema-Guided Dialog datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11020">Improving the Language Understanding Capabilities of Large Language Models Using Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bokai Hu, Sai Ashish Somayajula, Xin Pan, Zihan Huang, Pengtao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), built on decoder-only transformers, excel in natural language generation and adapt to diverse tasks using zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, these prompting methods often struggle on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, where encoder-only models like BERT-base outperform LLMs on benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE. This paper explores two approaches-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and proximal policy optimization (PPO)-to enhance LLMs' NLU abilities. To reduce the cost of full-model fine-tuning, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers, limiting updates to these layers during both SFT and PPO. In SFT, task-specific prompts are concatenated with input queries and ground-truth labels, optimizing with next-token prediction. Despite this, LLMs still underperform compared to models like BERT-base on several NLU tasks. To close this gap, we apply PPO, a reinforcement learning technique that treats each token generation as an action and uses a reward function based on alignment with ground-truth answers. PPO then updates the model to maximize these rewards, aligning outputs with correct labels. Our experiments with LLAMA2-7B show that PPO improves performance, with a 6.3-point gain over SFT on GLUE. PPO exceeds zero-shot by 38.7 points and few-shot by 26.1 points on GLUE, while surpassing these by 28.8 and 28.5 points on SuperGLUE. Additionally, PPO outperforms BERT-large by 2.7 points on GLUE and 9.3 points on SuperGLUE. The improvements are consistent across models like Qwen2.5-7B and MPT-7B, highlighting PPO's robustness in enhancing LLMs' NLU capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs) is critical given their widespread applications. Towards this goal, describing the topological and geometrical properties of internal representations has recently provided valuable insights. For a more comprehensive characterization of these inherently complex spaces, we present a novel framework based on zigzag persistence, a method in topological data analysis (TDA) well-suited for describing data undergoing dynamic transformations across layers. Within this framework, we introduce persistence similarity, a new metric that quantifies the persistence and transformation of topological features such as $p$-cycles throughout the model layers. Unlike traditional similarity measures, our approach captures the entire evolutionary trajectory of these features, providing deeper insights into the internal workings of LLMs. As a practical application, we leverage persistence similarity to identify and prune redundant layers, demonstrating comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets. Additionally, our analysis reveals consistent topological behaviors across various models and hyperparameter settings, suggesting a universal structure in LLM internal representations.</p>

Using nonlinear projections and clustering, we then identify when each interlocutor enters and exits various topics. Differences in conversational flow are quantified via $\textit{topic entropy}$, a summary measure of the "spread" of topics covered during a conversation, and $\textit{linguistic alignment}$, a time-varying measure of the cosine similarity between interlocutors' embeddings. Our findings suggest that interlocutors with a larger difference in the personality dimension of openness influence each other to spend more time discussing a wider range of topics and that interlocutors with a larger difference in extraversion experience a larger decrease in linguistic alignment throughout their conversation. We also examine how participants' affect (emotion) changes from before to after a conversation, finding that a larger difference in extraversion predicts a larger difference in affect change and that a greater topic entropy predicts a larger affect increase. This work demonstrates how communication research can be advanced through the use of high-dimensional NLP methods and identifies personality difference as an important driver of social influence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihan Yao, Wenxuan Ding, Shangbin Feng, Lucy Lu Wang, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: In the absence of abundant reliable annotations for challenging tasks and contexts, how can we expand the frontier of LLM capabilities with potentially wrong answers? We focus on two research questions: (1) Can LLMs generate reliable preferences among wrong options? And if so, (2) Would alignment with such wrong-over-wrong preferences be helpful? We employ methods based on self-consistency, token probabilities, and LLM-as-a-judge to elicit wrong-over-wrong preferences, and fine-tune language models with preference optimization approaches using these synthesized preferences. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs and eight datasets demonstrate that (1) LLMs do have preliminary capability in distinguishing various shades of wrong, achieving up to 20.9% higher performance than random guess; (2) Alignment with wrong-over-wrong preferences helps LLMs to produce less wrong and sometimes even outright correct answers, while overall improving model calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongtao Liu, Parker Riley, Daniel Deutsch, Alison Lui, Mengmeng Niu, Apu Shah, Markus Freitag</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting high-quality translations is crucial for the development and evaluation of machine translation systems. However, traditional human-only approaches are costly and slow. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of 11 approaches for acquiring translation data, including human-only, machineonly, and hybrid approaches. Our findings demonstrate that human-machine collaboration can match or even exceed the quality of human-only translations, while being more cost-efficient. Error analysis reveals the complementary strengths between human and machine contributions, highlighting the effectiveness of collaborative methods. Cost analysis further demonstrates the economic benefits of human-machine collaboration methods, with some approaches achieving top-tier quality at around 60% of the cost of traditional methods. We release a publicly available dataset containing nearly 18,000 segments of varying translation quality with corresponding human ratings to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Demchak, Xin Guan, Zekun Wu, Ziyi Xu, Adriano Koshiyama, Emre Kazim</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-generation bias benchmarks evaluate social biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing their outputs. However, the classifiers used in analysis often have inherent biases, leading to unfair conclusions. This study examines such biases in open-generation benchmarks like BOLD and SAGED. Using the MGSD dataset, we conduct two experiments. The first uses counterfactuals to measure prediction variations across demographic groups by altering stereotype-related prefixes. The second applies explainability tools (SHAP) to validate that the observed biases stem from these counterfactuals. Results reveal unequal treatment of demographic descriptors, calling for more robust bias metric models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Creston Brooks, Johannes Haubold, Charlie Cowen-Breen, Jay White, Desmond DeVaul, Frederick Riemenschneider, Karthik Narasimhan, Barbara Graziosi</p>
<p>Abstract: As premodern texts are passed down over centuries, errors inevitably accrue. These errors can be challenging to identify, as some have survived undetected for so long precisely because they are so elusive. While prior work has evaluated error detection methods on artificially-generated errors, we introduce the first dataset of real errors in premodern Greek, enabling the evaluation of error detection methods on errors that genuinely accumulated at some stage in the centuries-long copying process. To create this dataset, we use metrics derived from BERT conditionals to sample 1,000 words more likely to contain errors, which are then annotated and labeled by a domain expert as errors or not. We then propose and evaluate new error detection methods and find that our discriminator-based detector outperforms all other methods, improving the true positive rate for classifying real errors by 5%. We additionally observe that scribal errors are more difficult to detect than print or digitization errors. Our dataset enables the evaluation of error detection methods on real errors in premodern texts for the first time, providing a benchmark for developing more effective error detection algorithms to assist scholars in restoring premodern works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Previous text-to-SQL datasets and systems have primarily focused on user questions with clear intentions that can be answered. However, real user questions can often be ambiguous with multiple interpretations or unanswerable due to a lack of relevant data. In this work, we construct a practical conversational text-to-SQL dataset called PRACTIQ, consisting of ambiguous and unanswerable questions inspired by real-world user questions. We first identified four categories of ambiguous questions and four categories of unanswerable questions by studying existing text-to-SQL datasets. Then, we generate conversations with four turns: the initial user question, an assistant response seeking clarification, the user's clarification, and the assistant's clarified SQL response with the natural language explanation of the execution results. For some ambiguous queries, we also directly generate helpful SQL responses, that consider multiple aspects of ambiguity, instead of requesting user clarification. To benchmark the performance on ambiguous, unanswerable, and answerable questions, we implemented large language model (LLM)-based baselines using various LLMs. Our approach involves two steps: question category classification and clarification SQL prediction. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art systems struggle to handle ambiguous and unanswerable questions effectively. We will release our code for data generation and experiments on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayushman Gupta, Akhil Bhogal, Kripabandhu Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in Machine Translation (MT) tasks. However, their MT abilities in the context of code-switching (the practice of mixing two or more languages in an utterance) remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce Rule-Based Prompting, a novel prompting technique to generate code-mixed sentences. We measure and compare the code-mixed MT abilities of 3 popular multilingual LLMs: GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini Pro across five language pairs: English-{Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, French, Spanish} using $k$-shot prompting ($k\in\{0, 1, 10, 20\}$) and Rule-Based Prompting. Our findings suggest that though $k$-shot prompting often leads to the best results, Rule-Based prompting shows promise in generating unique code-mixed sentences that vary in their style of code-mixing. We also use $k$-shot prompting to gauge the code-mixed to English translation abilities of multilingual LLMs. For this purpose, we create a gold-standard code-mixed dataset spanning five language pairs: English-{Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, French, Spanish}. As a real-world application of our work, we create a code-mixed chatbot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharon Levy, William D. Adler, Tahilin Sanchez Karver, Mark Dredze, Michelle R. Kaufman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire beliefs about gender from training data and can therefore generate text with stereotypical gender attitudes. Prior studies have demonstrated model generations favor one gender or exhibit stereotypes about gender, but have not investigated the complex dynamics that can influence model reasoning and decision-making involving gender. We study gender equity within LLMs through a decision-making lens with a new dataset, DeMET Prompts, containing scenarios related to intimate, romantic relationships. We explore nine relationship configurations through name pairs across three name lists (men, women, neutral). We investigate equity in the context of gender roles through numerous lenses: typical and gender-neutral names, with and without model safety enhancements, same and mixed-gender relationships, and egalitarian versus traditional scenarios across various topics. While all models exhibit the same biases (women favored, then those with gender-neutral names, and lastly men), safety guardrails reduce bias. In addition, models tend to circumvent traditional male dominance stereotypes and side with 'traditionally female' individuals more often, suggesting relationships are viewed as a female domain by the models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hemant Yadav, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Sunayana Sitaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Information in speech can be divided into two categories: what is being said (content) and how it is expressed (other). Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques model speech at fixed segments, usually 10-25 ms, using a single embedding. Given the orthogonal nature of other and content information, attempting to optimize both within a single embedding results in suboptimal solutions. This approach divides the models capacity, limiting its ability to build complex hierarchical features effectively. In this work, we present an end-to-end speech representation learning framework designed to jointly optimize the other and content information (JOOCI) in speech. By using separate learnable parameters, JOOCI addresses this optimization challenge by modeling other and content information independently. Our results show that JOOCI consistently outperforms other SOTA models of similar size (100 million parameters) and pre-training data used (960 hours) by a significant margin when evaluated on a range of speech downstream tasks in the SUPERB benchmark, as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabit Hassan, Anthony Sicilia, Malihe Alikhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring robust safety measures across a wide range of scenarios is crucial for user-facing systems. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate valuable data for safety measures, they often exhibit distributional biases, focusing on common scenarios and neglecting rare but critical cases. This can undermine the effectiveness of safety protocols developed using such data. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates active learning with clustering to guide LLM generation, enhancing their representativeness and robustness in safety scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by constructing a dataset of 5.4K potential safety violations through an iterative process involving LLM generation and an active learner model's feedback. Our results show that the proposed framework produces a more representative set of safety scenarios without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying data distribution. Additionally, data acquired through our method improves the accuracy and F1 score of both the active learner model as well models outside the scope of active learning process, highlighting its broad applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Li, Caren Han, Yue Dai, Feiqi Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, yet their ability to handle long documents is constrained by computational limitations. Traditional approaches, such as truncating inputs, sparse self-attention, and chunking, attempt to mitigate these issues, but they often lead to information loss and hinder the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce ChuLo, a novel chunk representation method for long document classification that addresses these limitations. Our ChuLo groups input tokens using unsupervised keyphrase extraction, emphasizing semantically important keyphrase based chunk to retain core document content while reducing input length. This approach minimizes information loss and improves the efficiency of Transformer-based models. Preserving all tokens in long document understanding, especially token classification tasks, is especially important to ensure that fine-grained annotations, which depend on the entire sequence context, are not lost. We evaluate our method on multiple long document classification tasks and long document token classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eason Chen, Danyang Wang, Luyi Xu, Chen Cao, Xiao Fang, Jionghao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance K-12 STEM education by improving both teaching and learning processes. While previous studies have shown promising results, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding how LLMs are effectively applied, specifically through prompt engineering-the process of designing prompts to generate desired outputs. To address this gap, our study investigates empirical research published between 2021 and 2024 that explores the use of LLMs combined with prompt engineering in K-12 STEM education. Following the PRISMA protocol, we screened 2,654 papers and selected 30 studies for analysis. Our review identifies the prompting strategies employed, the types of LLMs used, methods of evaluating effectiveness, and limitations in prior work. Results indicate that while simple and zero-shot prompting are commonly used, more advanced techniques like few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting have demonstrated positive outcomes for various educational tasks. GPT-series models are predominantly used, but smaller and fine-tuned models (e.g., Blender 7B) paired with effective prompt engineering outperform prompting larger models (e.g., GPT-3) in specific contexts. Evaluation methods vary significantly, with limited empirical validation in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine translation (MT) has come a long way and is readily employed in production systems to serve millions of users daily. With the recent advances in generative AI, a new form of translation is becoming possible - video dubbing. This work motivates the importance of isochronic translation, especially in the context of automatic dubbing, and introduces `IsoChronoMeter' (ICM). ICM is a simple yet effective metric to measure isochrony of translations in a scalable and resource-efficient way without the need for gold data, based on state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) duration predictors. We motivate IsoChronoMeter and demonstrate its effectiveness. Using ICM we demonstrate the shortcomings of state-of-the-art translation systems and show the need for new methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxuan Wang, Jiaheng Wei, Chris Yuhao Liu, Jinlong Pang, Quan Liu, Ankit Parag Shah, Yujia Bao, Yang Liu, Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for ensuring ethical and responsible AI use, especially in addressing privacy leak, bias, safety, and evolving regulations. Existing approaches to LLM unlearning often rely on retain data or a reference LLM, yet they struggle to adequately balance unlearning performance with overall model utility. This challenge arises because leveraging explicit retain data or implicit knowledge of retain data from a reference LLM to fine-tune the model tends to blur the boundaries between the forgotten and retain data, as different queries often elicit similar responses. In this work, we propose eliminating the need to retain data or the reference LLM for response calibration in LLM unlearning. Recognizing that directly applying gradient ascent on the forget data often leads to optimization instability and poor performance, our method guides the LLM on what not to respond to, and importantly, how to respond, based on the forget data. Hence, we introduce Forget data only Loss AjustmenT (FLAT), a "flat" loss adjustment approach which addresses these issues by maximizing f-divergence between the available template answer and the forget answer only w.r.t. the forget data. The variational form of the defined f-divergence theoretically provides a way of loss adjustment by assigning different importance weights for the learning w.r.t. template responses and the forgetting of responses subject to unlearning. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach not only achieves superior unlearning performance compared to existing methods but also minimizes the impact on the model's retained capabilities, ensuring high utility across diverse tasks, including copyrighted content unlearning on Harry Potter dataset and MUSE Benchmark, and entity unlearning on the TOFU dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Model Swarms, a collaborative search algorithm to adapt LLMs via swarm intelligence, the collective behavior guiding individual systems. Specifically, Model Swarms starts with a pool of LLM experts and a utility function. Guided by the best-found checkpoints across models, diverse LLM experts collaboratively move in the weight space and optimize a utility function representing model adaptation objectives. Compared to existing model composition approaches, Model Swarms offers tuning-free model adaptation, works in low-data regimes with as few as 200 examples, and does not require assumptions about specific experts in the swarm or how they should be composed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Model Swarms could flexibly adapt LLM experts to a single task, multi-task domains, reward models, as well as diverse human interests, improving over 12 model composition baselines by up to 21.0% across tasks and contexts. Further analysis reveals that LLM experts discover previously unseen capabilities in initial checkpoints and that Model Swarms enable the weak-to-strong transition of experts through the collaborative search process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Peng, Liang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, LLaMA, and Claude have prevailed in countless domains, including legal scenarios. With LLMs' rapid technological progress, the development of prompt engineering (PE) as an interface between the LLMs and real-world applications has drawn the attention of all developers. Various PE methods have been proposed to overcome real-world challenges, such as few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, RAG for legal judgment prediction (LJP) is still underexplored. To address this, we propose "Athena", a novel framework cultivating RAG as a core preprocess component to enhance LLMs' performance on specialized tasks. Athena constructs a knowledge base for accusations, attached with a semantic retrieval mechanism through vectorization. Our experiments show that Athena's overall performance has improved significantly, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CAIL2018 dataset. Our ablation study on the in-context window size parameter further reproduces LLMs' "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon with a relative positional variation. And with moderate hyper-parameter-tuning, we can achieve at most 95% of accuracy accordingly. We also study the impact of query rewriting and data distribution, providing possible directions for future research based on former analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haosheng Qian, Yixing Fan, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) appears as a promising method to alleviate the "hallucination" problem in large language models (LLMs), since it can incorporate external traceable resources for response generation. The essence of RAG in combating the hallucination issue lies in accurately attributing claims in responses to the corresponding retrieved documents. However, most of existing works focus on improving the quality of generated responses from the LLM, while largely overlooked its ability to attribute sources accurately. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis about the capabilities of LLMs in generating citations within response generation, and further introduce a novel method to enhance their citation generation abilities. Specifically, we evaluate both the correctness and citation quality for seven widely-used LLMs on two benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, we introduce new citation evaluation metrics to eliminate the over-penalization of unnecessary and excessive citations in existing metrics. Furthermore, we propose a Generate-then-Refine method that completes relevant citations and removes irrelevant ones without altering the response text. The results on WebGLM-QA, ASQA and ELI5 datasets show that our method substantially improves the quality of citations in responses generated by LLMs.</p>

We examine the hate speech detection ability of zero-shot and fine-tuned GPT. Our findings indicate that: (1) English has the highest performance and the code-switching scenario of English-Tamil being the lowest, (2) fine-tuning improves performance consistently across languages whilst translation yields mixed results. Through simple experimentation with original text and machine-translated text for hate speech detection along with a qualitative error analysis, this paper sheds light on the socio-cultural nuances and complexities of languages that may not be captured by automatic translation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph-structured information offers rich contextual information that can enhance language models by providing structured relationships and hierarchies, leading to more expressive embeddings for various applications such as retrieval, question answering, and classification. However, existing methods for integrating graph and text embeddings, often based on Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or shallow transformers, are limited in their ability to fully exploit the heterogeneous nature of these modalities. To overcome this, we propose Janus, a simple yet effective framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to jointly encode text and graph data. Specifically, Janus employs an MLP adapter to project graph embeddings into the same space as text embeddings, allowing the LLM to process both modalities jointly. Unlike prior work, we also introduce contrastive learning to align the graph and text spaces more effectively, thereby improving the quality of learned joint embeddings. Empirical results across six datasets spanning three tasks, knowledge graph-contextualized question answering, graph-text pair classification, and retrieval, demonstrate that Janus consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant improvements across multiple datasets, with gains of up to 11.4% in QA tasks. These results highlight Janus's effectiveness in integrating graph and text data. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

Since conversation data is not sent to an LLM during inference, it preserves confidentiality required in HR-related tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Shamshiri, Kyeong Rok Ryu, June Young Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks. However, they still struggle with long-context documents. This study evaluates the performance of three leading LLMs: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on lengthy, complex, and opinion-varying documents concerning infrastructure projects, under both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our results indicate that GPT-4o excels in zero-shot scenarios for simpler, shorter documents, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet surpasses GPT-4o in handling more complex, sentiment-fluctuating opinions. In few-shot scenarios, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms overall, while GPT-4o shows greater stability as the number of demonstrations increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bibek Upadhayay, Vahid Behzadan, Amin Karbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in performing tasks across various domains without needing explicit retraining. This capability, known as In-Context Learning (ICL), while impressive, exposes LLMs to a variety of adversarial prompts and jailbreaks that manipulate safety-trained LLMs into generating undesired or harmful output. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of ICL in LLMs through the lens of cognitive neuroscience, by drawing parallels between learning in human cognition with ICL. We applied the principles of Cognitive Load Theory in LLMs and empirically validate that similar to human cognition, LLMs also suffer from cognitive overload a state where the demand on cognitive processing exceeds the available capacity of the model, leading to potential errors. Furthermore, we demonstrated how an attacker can exploit ICL to jailbreak LLMs through deliberately designed prompts that induce cognitive overload on LLMs, thereby compromising the safety mechanisms of LLMs. We empirically validate this threat model by crafting various cognitive overload prompts and show that advanced models such as GPT-4, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Claude-3 OPUS, Llama-3-70B-Instruct, Gemini-1.0-Pro, and Gemini-1.5-Pro can be successfully jailbroken, with attack success rates of up to 99.99%. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in LLMs and underscore the urgency of developing robust safeguards. We propose integrating insights from cognitive load theory into the design and evaluation of LLMs to better anticipate and mitigate the risks of adversarial attacks. By expanding our experiments to encompass a broader range of models and by highlighting vulnerabilities in LLMs' ICL, we aim to ensure the development of safer and more reliable AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wendi Li, Yixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Process Reward Modeling (PRM) is critical for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks where the accuracy of intermediate steps significantly influences the overall outcome. Existing PRM approaches, primarily framed as classification problems, employ cross-entropy loss to independently evaluate each step's correctness. This method can lead to suboptimal reward distribution and does not adequately address the interdependencies among steps. To address these limitations, we introduce the Process Q-value Model (PQM), a novel framework that redefines PRM in the context of a Markov Decision Process. PQM optimizes Q-value rankings based on a novel comparative loss function, enhancing the model's ability to capture the intricate dynamics among sequential decisions. This approach provides a more granular and theoretically grounded methodology for process rewards. Our extensive empirical evaluations across various sampling policies, language model backbones, and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that PQM outperforms classification-based PRMs. The effectiveness of the comparative loss function is highlighted in our comprehensive ablation studies, confirming PQM's practical efficacy and theoretical advantage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinping Zhao, Dongfang Li, Yan Zhong, Boren Hu, Yibin Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have investigated extracting evidence from retrieved passages to reduce computational costs and enhance the final RAG performance, yet it remains challenging. Existing methods heavily rely on heuristic-based augmentation, encountering several issues: (1) Poor generalization due to hand-crafted context filtering; (2) Semantics deficiency due to rule-based context chunking; (3) Skewed length due to sentence-wise filter learning. To address these issues, we propose a model-based evidence extraction learning framework, SEER, optimizing a vanilla model as an evidence extractor with desired properties through self-aligned learning. Extensive experiments show that our method largely improves the final RAG performance, enhances the faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness of the extracted evidence, and reduces the evidence length by 9.25 times.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods are limited by their reliance on a fixed number of retrieved documents, often resulting in incomplete or noisy information that undermines task performance. Although recent adaptive approaches alleviated these problems, their application in intricate and real-world multimodal tasks remains limited. To address these, we propose a new approach called Self-adaptive Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAM-RAG), tailored specifically for multimodal contexts. SAM-RAG not only dynamically filters relevant documents based on the input query, including image captions when needed, but also verifies the quality of both the retrieved documents and the output. Extensive experimental results show that SAM-RAG surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval accuracy and response generation. By further ablation experiments and effectiveness analysis, SAM-RAG maintains high recall quality while improving overall task performance in multimodal RAG task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Xu, Rujun Han, Zifeng Wang, Long T. Le, Dhruv Madeka, Lei Li, William Yang Wang, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) have enabled smaller student models to approach the performance of larger teacher models. However, popular methods such as supervised KD and on-policy KD, are adversely impacted by the knowledge gaps between teacher-student in practical scenarios. Supervised KD suffers from a distribution mismatch between training with a static dataset and inference over final student-generated outputs. Conversely, on-policy KD, which uses student-generated samples for training, can suffer from low-quality training examples with which teacher models are not familiar, resulting in inaccurate teacher feedback. To address these limitations, we introduce Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SKD), a novel approach that leverages cooperation between student and teacher models to generate high-quality training data on-the-fly while aligning with the student's inference-time distribution. In SKD, the student proposes tokens, and the teacher replaces poorly ranked ones based on its own distribution, transferring high-quality knowledge adaptively. We evaluate SKD on various text generation tasks, including translation, summarization, math, and instruction following, and show that SKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods across different domains, data sizes, and model initialization strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Reber, Sean Richardson, Todd Nief, Cristina Garbacea, Victor Veitch</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper concerns the evaluation of reward models used in language modeling. A reward model is a function that takes a prompt and a response and assigns a score indicating how good that response is for the prompt. A key challenge is that reward models are usually imperfect proxies for actual preferences. For example, we may worry that a model trained to reward helpfulness learns to instead prefer longer responses. In this paper, we develop an evaluation method, RATE (Rewrite-based Attribute Treatment Estimators), that allows us to measure the causal effect of a given attribute of a response (e.g., length) on the reward assigned to that response. The core idea is to use large language models to rewrite responses to produce imperfect counterfactuals, and to adjust for rewriting error by rewriting twice. We show that the RATE estimator is consistent under reasonable assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RATE on synthetic and real-world data, showing that it can accurately estimate the effect of a given attribute on the reward model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongxiang Sun, Zihua Si, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research on query generation has focused on using Large Language Models (LLMs), which despite bringing state-of-the-art performance, also introduce issues with hallucinations in the generated queries. In this work, we introduce relevance hallucination and factuality hallucination as a new typology for hallucination problems brought by query generation based on LLMs. We propose an effective way to separate content from form in LLM-generated queries, which preserves the factual knowledge extracted and integrated from the inputs and compiles the syntactic structure, including function words, using the powerful linguistic capabilities of the LLM. Specifically, we introduce a model-agnostic and training-free method that turns the Large Language Model into a Pointer-Generator (LargePiG), where the pointer attention distribution leverages the LLM's inherent attention weights, and the copy probability is derived from the difference between the vocabulary distribution of the model's high layers and the last layer. To validate the effectiveness of LargePiG, we constructed two datasets for assessing the hallucination problems in query generation, covering both document and video scenarios. Empirical studies on various LLMs demonstrated the superiority of LargePiG on both datasets. Additional experiments also verified that LargePiG could reduce hallucination in large vision language models and improve the accuracy of document-based question-answering and factuality evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitong Luo, Xuying Meng, Suhang Wang, Tianxiang Zhao, Fali Wang, Hanyun Cao, Yujun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in the real world. Recently, due to the powerful emergent capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in modeling graphs. The key to effectively applying LLMs on graphs is converting graph data into a format LLMs can comprehend. Graph-to-token approaches are popular in enabling LLMs to process graph information. They transform graphs into sequences of tokens and align them with text tokens through instruction tuning, where self-supervised instruction tuning helps LLMs acquire general knowledge about graphs, and supervised fine-tuning specializes LLMs for the downstream tasks on graphs. Despite their initial success, we find that existing methods have a misalignment between self-supervised tasks and supervised downstream tasks, resulting in negative transfer from self-supervised fine-tuning to downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose Graph Alignment Large Language Models (GALLM) to benefit from aligned task templates. In the self-supervised tuning stage, we introduce a novel text matching task using templates aligned with downstream tasks. In the task-specific tuning stage, we propose two category prompt methods that learn supervision information from additional explanation with further aligned templates. Experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in supervised learning, multi-dataset generalizability, and particularly in zero-shot capability, highlighting the model's potential as a graph foundation model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihuang Zhong, Kunfeng Chen, Liang Ding, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in text-to-SQL, which involves translating natural language questions into SQL queries. However, current text-to-SQL LLMs are computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in real-world applications, highlighting the importance of compressing them. To achieve this goal, knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach, which aims to distill the larger teacher model into a smaller student model. While numerous KD methods for autoregressive LLMs have emerged recently, it is still under-explored whether they work well in complex text-to-SQL scenarios. To this end, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that these KD methods generally fall short in balancing performance and efficiency. In response to this problem, we propose to improve the KD with Imperfect Data, namely KID, which effectively boosts the performance without introducing much training budget. The core of KID is to efficiently mitigate the training-inference mismatch by simulating the cascading effect of inference in the imperfect training data. Extensive experiments on 5 text-to-SQL benchmarks show that, KID can not only achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +5.83% average score) across all model types and sizes, but also effectively improve the training efficiency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11385">Do LLMs Have the Generalization Ability in Conducting Causal Inference?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Wang, Dongming Zhao, Bo Wang, Ruifang He, Yuexian Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: In causal inference, generalization capability refers to the ability to conduct causal inference methods on new data to estimate the causal-effect between unknown phenomenon, which is crucial for expanding the boundaries of knowledge. Studies have evaluated the causal inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) concerning known phenomena, yet the generalization capabilities of LLMs concerning unseen phenomena remain unexplored. In this paper, we selected four tasks: Causal Path Discovery (CP), Backdoor Adjustment (BA), Factual Inference (FI), and Counterfactual Inference (CI) as representatives of causal inference tasks. To generate evaluation questions about previously unseen phenomena in new data on the four tasks, we propose a benchmark generation framework, which employs randomly generated graphs and node names to formulate questions within hypothetical new causal scenarios. Based on this framework, we compile a benchmark dataset of varying levels of question complexity. We extensively tested the generalization capabilities of five leading LLMs across four tasks. Experiment results reveal that while LLMs exhibit good generalization performance in solving simple CP, FI, and complex CI questions, they encounter difficulties when tackling BA questions and face obvious performance fluctuations as the problem complexity changes. Furthermore, when the names of phenomena incorporate existing terms, even if these names are entirely novel, their generalization performance can still be hindered by interference from familiar terms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Translation is important for cross-language communication, and many efforts have been made to improve its accuracy. However, less investment is conducted in aligning translations with human preferences, such as translation tones or styles. In this paper, a new method is proposed to effectively generate large-scale multilingual parallel corpora with specific translation preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, an automatic pipeline is designed to distill human preferences into smaller Machine Translation (MT) models for efficiently and economically supporting large-scale calls in online services. Experiments indicate that the proposed method takes the lead in translation tasks with aligned human preferences by a large margin. Meanwhile, on popular public benchmarks like WMT and Flores, on which our models were not trained, the proposed method also shows a competitive performance compared to SOTA works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongxiang Sun, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Yang Song, Han Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are designed to incorporate external knowledge, reducing hallucinations caused by insufficient parametric (internal) knowledge. However, even with accurate and relevant retrieved content, RAG models can still produce hallucinations by generating outputs that conflict with the retrieved information. Detecting such hallucinations requires disentangling how Large Language Models (LLMs) utilize external and parametric knowledge. Current detection methods often focus on one of these mechanisms or without decoupling their intertwined effects, making accurate detection difficult. In this paper, we investigate the internal mechanisms behind hallucinations in RAG scenarios. We discover hallucinations occur when the Knowledge FFNs in LLMs overemphasize parametric knowledge in the residual stream, while Copying Heads fail to effectively retain or integrate external knowledge from retrieved content. Based on these findings, we propose ReDeEP, a novel method that detects hallucinations by decoupling LLM's utilization of external context and parametric knowledge. Our experiments show that ReDeEP significantly improves RAG hallucination detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce AARF, which mitigates hallucinations by modulating the contributions of Knowledge FFNs and Copying Heads.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we report on communication experiments conducted in the summer of 2022 during a deep dive to the wreck of the Titanic. Radio transmission is not possible in deep sea water, and communication links rely on sonar signals. Due to the low bandwidth of sonar signals and the need to communicate readable data, text messaging is used in deep-sea missions. In this paper, we report results and experiences from a messaging system that converts speech to text in a submarine, sends text messages to the surface, and reconstructs those messages as synthetic lip-synchronous videos of the speakers. The resulting system was tested during an actual dive to Titanic in the summer of 2022. We achieved an acceptable latency for a system of such complexity as well as good quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihang Zhao, Youliang Yuan, Xiaoying Tang, Pinjia He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a strong understanding of the real world and can even handle complex tasks. However, they still fail on some straightforward visual question-answering (VQA) problems. This paper dives deeper into this issue, revealing that models tend to err when answering easy questions (e.g. Yes/No questions) about an image, even though they can correctly describe it. We refer to this model behavior discrepancy between difficult and simple questions as model laziness. To systematically investigate model laziness, we manually construct LazyBench, a benchmark that includes Yes/No, multiple choice, short answer questions, and image description tasks that are related to the same subjects in the images. Based on LazyBench, we observe that laziness widely exists in current advanced MLLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-pro, Claude 3 and LLaVA-v1.5-13B), and it is more pronounced on stronger models. We also analyze the VQA v2 (LLaVA-v1.5-13B) benchmark and find that about half of its failure cases are caused by model laziness, which further highlights the importance of ensuring that the model fully utilizes its capability. To this end, we conduct preliminary exploration on how to mitigate laziness and find that chain of thought (CoT) can effectively address this issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Diehl Martinez, Pietro Lesci, Paula Buttery</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing the number of parameters in language models is a common strategy to enhance their performance. However, smaller language models remain valuable due to their lower operational costs. Despite their advantages, smaller models frequently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, even when provided with equivalent data and computational resources. Specifically, their performance tends to degrade in the late pretraining phase. This is anecdotally attributed to their reduced representational capacity. Yet, the exact causes of this performance degradation remain unclear. We use the Pythia model suite to analyse the training dynamics that underlie this phenomenon. Across different model sizes, we investigate the convergence of the Attention and MLP activations to their final state and examine how the effective rank of their parameters influences this process. We find that nearly all layers in larger models stabilise early in training - within the first 20% - whereas layers in smaller models exhibit slower and less stable convergence, especially when their parameters have lower effective rank. By linking the convergence of layers' activations to their parameters' effective rank, our analyses can guide future work to address inefficiencies in the learning dynamics of small models.</p>

However, such models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, leading to the generation of harmful responses. Despite recent research on single-turn jailbreak strategies to facilitate the development of defence mechanisms, the challenge of revealing vulnerabilities under multi-turn setting remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we propose Jigsaw Puzzles (JSP), a straightforward yet effective multi-turn jailbreak strategy against the advanced LLMs. JSP splits questions into harmless fractions as the input of each turn, and requests LLMs to reconstruct and respond to questions under multi-turn interaction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed JSP jailbreak bypasses original safeguards against explicitly harmful content, achieving an average attack success rate of 93.76% on 189 harmful queries across 5 advanced LLMs (Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini). Moreover, JSP achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate of 92% on GPT-4 on the harmful query benchmark, and exhibits strong resistant to defence strategies. Warning: this paper contains offensive examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Diehl Martinez, Zebulon Goriely, Andrew Caines, Paula Buttery, Lisa Beinborn</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models strongly rely on frequency information because they maximize the likelihood of tokens during pre-training. As a consequence, language models tend to not generalize well to tokens that are seldom seen during training. Moreover, maximum likelihood training has been discovered to give rise to anisotropy: representations of tokens in a model tend to cluster tightly in a high-dimensional cone, rather than spreading out over their representational capacity.
  Our work introduces a method for quantifying the frequency bias of a language model by assessing sentence-level perplexity with respect to token-level frequency. We then present a method for reducing the frequency bias of a language model by inducing a syntactic prior over token representations during pre-training. Our Syntactic Smoothing method adjusts the maximum likelihood objective function to distribute the learning signal to syntactically similar tokens. This approach results in better performance on infrequent English tokens and a decrease in anisotropy. We empirically show that the degree of anisotropy in a model correlates with its frequency bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Cai, Ding Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge during pre-training, but over time, this knowledge may become incorrect or outdated, necessitating updates after training. Knowledge editing techniques address this issue without the need for costly re-training. However, most existing methods are designed for single edits, and as the number of edits increases, they often cause a decline in the model's overall performance, posing significant challenges for sequential editing. To overcome this, we propose Orthogonal Subspace Editing, O-Edit. This algorithm orthogonalizes the direction of each knowledge update, minimizing interference between successive updates and reducing the impact of new updates on unrelated knowledge. Our approach does not require replaying previously edited data and processes each edit knowledge on time. It can perform thousands of edits on mainstream LLMs, achieving an average performance improvement that is 4.2 times better than existing methods while effectively preserving the model's performance on downstream tasks, all with minimal additional parameter overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyoung Kim, Dayoon Ko, Gunhee Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of language, resolving new linguistic expressions in continuously updating knowledge bases remains a formidable challenge. This challenge becomes critical in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with knowledge bases, as emerging expressions hinder the retrieval of relevant documents, leading to generator hallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task aimed at resolving emerging mentions to dynamic entities and present DynamicER benchmark. Our benchmark includes dynamic entity mention resolution and entity-centric knowledge-intensive QA task, evaluating entity linking and RAG model's adaptability to new expressions, respectively. We discovered that current entity linking models struggle to link these new expressions to entities. Therefore, we propose a temporal segmented clustering method with continual adaptation, effectively managing the temporal dynamics of evolving entities and emerging mentions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, enhancing RAG model performance on QA task with resolved mentions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neil Rathi, Johannes Mehrer, Badr AlKhamissi, Taha Binhuraib, Nicholas M. Blauch, Martin Schrimpf</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurons in the brain are spatially organized such that neighbors on tissue often exhibit similar response profiles. In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihua Zhou, Xiaochuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is crucial for generating responses that are beneficial to humanity. While LLMs have the capability to identify and avoid harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to "jailbreak" attacks, where carefully crafted prompts can induce the generation of toxic content. Traditional single-round jailbreak attacks, such as GCG and AutoDAN, do not alter the sensitive words in the dangerous prompts. Although they can temporarily bypass the model's safeguards through prompt engineering, their success rate drops significantly as the LLM is further fine-tuned, and they cannot effectively circumvent static rule-based filters that remove the hazardous vocabulary.
  In this study, to better understand jailbreak attacks, we introduce a multi-round jailbreak approach. This method can rewrite the dangerous prompts, decomposing them into a series of less harmful sub-questions to bypass the LLM's safety checks. We first use the LLM to perform a decomposition task, breaking down a set of natural language questions into a sequence of progressive sub-questions, which are then used to fine-tune the Llama3-8B model, enabling it to decompose hazardous prompts. The fine-tuned model is then used to break down the problematic prompt, and the resulting sub-questions are sequentially asked to the victim model. If the victim model rejects a sub-question, a new decomposition is generated, and the process is repeated until the final objective is achieved. Our experimental results show a 94\% success rate on the llama2-7B and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in circumventing static rule-based filters.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11588">Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Knowledge Graph Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yejin Kim, Eojin Kang, Juae Kim, H. Howie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically improve performance by either retrieving semantically similar information, or enhancing reasoning abilities through structured prompts like chain-of-thought. While both strategies are considered crucial, it remains unclear which has a greater impact on model performance or whether a combination of both is necessary. This paper answers this question by proposing a knowledge graph (KG)-based random-walk reasoning approach that leverages causal relationships. We conduct experiments on the commonsense question answering task that is based on a KG. The KG inherently provides both relevant information, such as related entity keywords, and a reasoning structure through the connections between nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed KG-based random-walk reasoning method improves the reasoning ability and performance of LLMs. Interestingly, incorporating three seemingly irrelevant sentences into the query using KG-based random-walk reasoning enhances LLM performance, contrary to conventional wisdom. These findings suggest that integrating causal structures into prompts can significantly improve reasoning capabilities, providing new insights into the role of causality in optimizing LLM performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the findings from the third edition of the Chat Translation Shared Task. As with previous editions, the task involved translating bilingual customer support conversations, specifically focusing on the impact of conversation context in translation quality and evaluation. We also include two new language pairs: English-Korean and English-Dutch, in addition to the set of language pairs from previous editions: English-German, English-French, and English-Brazilian Portuguese. We received 22 primary submissions and 32 contrastive submissions from eight teams, with each language pair having participation from at least three teams. We evaluated the systems comprehensively using both automatic metrics and human judgments via a direct assessment framework. The official rankings for each language pair were determined based on human evaluation scores, considering performance in both translation directions--agent and customer. Our analysis shows that while the systems excelled at translating individual turns, there is room for improvement in overall conversation-level translation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Anh Dang, Limor Raviv, Lukas Galke</p>
<p>Abstract: Morphology is a crucial factor for multilingual language modeling as it poses direct challenges for tokenization. Here, we seek to understand how tokenization influences the morphological knowledge encoded in multilingual language models. Specifically, we capture the impact of tokenization by contrasting two multilingual language models: mT5 and ByT5. The two models share the same architecture, training objective, and training data and only differ in their tokenization strategies: subword tokenization vs. character-level tokenization. Probing the morphological knowledge encoded in these models on four tasks and 17 languages, our analyses show that multilingual language models learn the morphological systems of some languages better than others despite similar average performance and that morphological information is encoded in the middle and late layers, where characted-based models need a few more layers to yield commensurate probing accuracy. Finally, we show that languages with more irregularities benefit more from having a higher share of the pre-training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songyuan Liu, Ziyang Zhang, Runze Yan, Wei Wu, Carl Yang, Jiaying Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral tool for users from various backgrounds. LLMs, trained on vast corpora, reflect the linguistic and cultural nuances embedded in their pre-training data. However, the values and perspectives inherent in this data can influence the behavior of LLMs, leading to potential biases. As a result, the use of LLMs in contexts involving spiritual or moral values necessitates careful consideration of these underlying biases. Our work starts with verification of our hypothesis by testing the spiritual values of popular LLMs. Experimental results show that LLMs' spiritual values are quite diverse, as opposed to the stereotype of atheists or secularists. We then investigate how different spiritual values affect LLMs in social-fairness scenarios e.g., hate speech identification). Our findings reveal that different spiritual values indeed lead to different sensitivity to different hate target groups. Furthermore, we propose to continue pre-training LLMs on spiritual texts, and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating spiritual bias.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11654">Transformer Layer Injection: A Novel Approach for Efficient Upscaling of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> James Vo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose Transformer Layer Injection (TLI), a novel method for efficiently upscaling large language models (LLMs) while minimizing computational costs and maintaining model performance. Model scale is a key factor in enhancing the quality of machine learning models, and TLI addresses the challenge of scaling by reducing initial loss, minimizing fine-tuning requirements, and preserving model complexity. Our approach improves upon the conventional Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) technique by injecting new layers into every set of K layers, enabling hidden representations to pass through transformer blocks with minimal disruption. We compare TLI with existing approaches, including Mixture of Experts (MoE) and DUS, and validate its efficiency through experiments on small LLMs (LLama3 1B, 3B, and 8B). Results show that TLI achieves better initialization, requires fewer training steps, and delivers superior accuracy on tasks such as KoBEST and KMCQA, with models performing effectively even without additional training. TLI is demonstrated to be both data-efficient and cost-effective, significantly outperforming existing methods. Its scalability and simplicity make it a promising solution for upscaling transformer-based models, with potential applications in scaling models from 10B to 405B parameters.</p>

We seek to address this challenge via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). On this approach, product names are retrieved from a catalog and incorporated into the context used by a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned to do contextual spelling correction. Through quantitative evaluation and qualitative error analyses, we find improvements in spelling correction utilizing the RAG framework beyond a stand-alone LLM. We also demonstrate the value of additional finetuning of the LLM to incorporate retrieved context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Tater, Sabine Schulte im Walde, Diego Frassinelli</p>
<p>Abstract: The visual representation of a concept varies significantly depending on its meaning and the context where it occurs; this poses multiple challenges both for vision and multimodal models. Our study focuses on concreteness, a well-researched lexical-semantic variable, using it as a case study to examine the variability in visual representations. We rely on images associated with approximately 1,000 abstract and concrete concepts extracted from two different datasets: Bing and YFCC. Our goals are: (i) evaluate whether visual diversity in the depiction of concepts can reliably distinguish between concrete and abstract concepts; (ii) analyze the variability of visual features across multiple images of the same concept through a nearest neighbor analysis; and (iii) identify challenging factors contributing to this variability by categorizing and annotating images. Our findings indicate that for classifying images of abstract versus concrete concepts, a combination of basic visual features such as color and texture is more effective than features extracted by more complex models like Vision Transformer (ViT). However, ViTs show better performances in the nearest neighbor analysis, emphasizing the need for a careful selection of visual features when analyzing conceptual variables through modalities other than text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dana Ramati, Daniela Gottesman, Mor Geva</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous prompts, or "soft prompts", are a widely-adopted parameter-efficient tuning strategy for large language models, but are often less favorable due to their opaque nature. Prior attempts to interpret continuous prompts relied on projecting individual prompt tokens onto the vocabulary space. However, this approach is problematic as performant prompts can yield arbitrary or contradictory text, and it interprets prompt tokens individually. In this work, we propose a new approach to interpret continuous prompts that elicits textual descriptions from their representations during model inference. Using a Patchscopes variant (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024) called InSPEcT over various tasks, we show our method often yields accurate task descriptions which become more faithful as task performance increases. Moreover, an elaborated version of InSPEcT reveals biased features in continuous prompts, whose presence correlates with biased model predictions. Providing an effective interpretability solution, InSPEcT can be leveraged to debug unwanted properties in continuous prompts and inform developers on ways to mitigate them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Pacchiardi, Marko Tesic, Lucy G. Cheke, Jos\'e Hern\'andez-Orallo</p>
<p>Abstract: The integrity of AI benchmarks is fundamental to accurately assess the capabilities of AI systems. The internal validity of these benchmarks - i.e., making sure they are free from confounding factors - is crucial for ensuring that they are measuring what they are designed to measure. In this paper, we explore a key issue related to internal validity: the possibility that AI systems can solve benchmarks in unintended ways, bypassing the capability being tested. This phenomenon, widely known in human and animal experiments, is often referred to as the 'Clever Hans' effect, where tasks are solved using spurious cues, often involving much simpler processes than those putatively assessed. Previous research suggests that language models can exhibit this behaviour as well. In several older Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, individual $n$-grams like "not" have been found to be highly predictive of the correct labels, and supervised NLP models have been shown to exploit these patterns. In this work, we investigate the extent to which simple $n$-grams extracted from benchmark instances can be combined to predict labels in modern multiple-choice benchmarks designed for LLMs, and whether LLMs might be using such $n$-gram patterns to solve these benchmarks. We show how simple classifiers trained on these $n$-grams can achieve high scores on several benchmarks, despite lacking the capabilities being tested. Additionally, we provide evidence that modern LLMs might be using these superficial patterns to solve benchmarks. This suggests that the internal validity of these benchmarks may be compromised and caution should be exercised when interpreting LLM performance results on them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyan Shi, Sander Land, Acyr Locatelli, Matthieu Geist, Max Bartolo</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimisation (IPO), have emerged as alternatives to online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) for aligning language models to human preferences, without the need for explicit reward modelling. These methods generally aim to increase the likelihood of generating better (preferred) completions while discouraging worse (non-preferred) ones, while staying close to the original model's behaviour. In this work, we explore the relationship between completion likelihood and model performance in state-of-the-art DAAs, and identify a critical issue of likelihood over-optimisation. Contrary to expectations, we find that higher likelihood of better completions and larger margins between better and worse completion likelihoods do not necessarily lead to better performance, and may even degrade it. Our analysis reveals that while higher likelihood correlates with better memorisation of factual knowledge patterns, a slightly lower completion likelihood tends to improve output diversity, thus leading to better generalisation to unseen scenarios. Moreover, we identify two key indicators that signal when over-optimised output diversity begins to harm performance: Decreasing Entropy over Top-k Tokens and Diminishing Top-k Probability Mass. Our experimental results validate that these indicators are reliable signs of declining performance under different regularisations, helping prevent over-optimisation and improve alignment with human preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seung-Woo Choi, Ga-Hyun Yoo, Jay-Yoon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in translation without needing to be finetuned on additional parallel corpora. However, they still underperform for low-resource language pairs. Previous works have focused on mitigating this issue by leveraging relevant few-shot examples or external resources such as dictionaries or grammar books, making models heavily reliant on these nonparametric sources of information. In this paper, we propose a novel method named IntGrad MT that focuses on fully exploiting an LLM's inherent translation capability. IntGrad MT achieves this by constructing a chain of few-shot examples, each consisting of a source sentence and the model's own translation, that rise incrementally in difficulty. IntGrad MT employs two techniques: Sentence Interpolation, which generates a sequence of sentences that gradually change from an easy sentence to translate to a difficult one, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates this chain using translations of earlier sentences as few-shot examples for the translation of subsequent ones. With this approach, we observe a substantial enhancement in the xCOMET scores of various LLMs for multiple languages, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi(8.26), Swahili(7.10), Bengali(6.97) and Marathi(13.03). Our approach presents a practical way of enhancing LLMs' performance without extra training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hinder their practical applications. To address this, we propose a Magnifier Prompt (MagPrompt), a simple yet effective method to tackle hallucinations in MLLMs via extremely simple instructions. MagPrompt is based on the following two key principles, which guide the design of various effective prompts, demonstrating robustness: (1) MLLMs should focus more on the image. (2) When there are conflicts between the image and the model's inner knowledge, MLLMs should prioritize the image. MagPrompt is training-free and can be applied to open-source and closed-source models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini-pro. It performs well across many datasets and its effectiveness is comparable or even better than more complex methods like VCD. Furthermore, our prompt design principles and experimental analyses provide valuable insights into multimodal hallucination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed massive improvements in reasoning and decision-making skills and can hold natural conversations with users. Recently, many tool-use benchmark datasets have been proposed. However, existing datasets have the following limitations: (1). Insufficient evaluation scenarios (e.g., only cover limited tool-use scenes). (2). Extensive evaluation costs (e.g., GPT API costs). To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a multi-granularity tool-use benchmark for large language models called MTU-Bench. For the "multi-granularity" property, our MTU-Bench covers five tool usage scenes (i.e., single-turn and single-tool, single-turn and multiple-tool, multiple-turn and single-tool, multiple-turn and multiple-tool, and out-of-distribution tasks). Besides, all evaluation metrics of our MTU-Bench are based on the prediction results and the ground truth without using any GPT or human evaluation metrics. Moreover, our MTU-Bench is collected by transforming existing high-quality datasets to simulate real-world tool usage scenarios, and we also propose an instruction dataset called MTU-Instruct data to enhance the tool-use abilities of existing LLMs. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MTU-Bench. Code and data will be released at https: //github.com/MTU-Bench-Team/MTU-Bench.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongchuan Zeng, Senyu Han, Lu Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, particularly in multilingual contexts. While recent studies suggest that LLMs can transfer skills learned in one language to others, the internal mechanisms behind this ability remain unclear. We observed that the neuron activation patterns of LLMs exhibit similarities when processing the same language, revealing the existence and location of key linguistic regions. Additionally, we found that neuron activation patterns are similar when processing sentences with the same semantic meaning in different languages. This indicates that LLMs map semantically identical inputs from different languages into a "Lingua Franca", a common semantic latent space that allows for consistent processing across languages. This semantic alignment becomes more pronounced with training and increased model size, resulting in a more language-agnostic activation pattern. Moreover, we found that key linguistic neurons are concentrated in the first and last layers of LLMs, becoming denser in the first layers as training progresses. Experiments on BLOOM and LLaMA2 support these findings, highlighting the structural evolution of multilingual LLMs during training and scaling up. This paper provides insights into the internal workings of LLMs, offering a foundation for future improvements in their cross-lingual capabilities.</p>

Our results show that persona-prompted LLMs produce more diverse annotations than LLMs prompted without personas and that these effects are both controllable and repeatable, making our approach a suitable tool for improving data annotation in subjective NLP tasks like toxicity detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yao, Penlei Gao, Lichun Li, Yuan Zhao, Xiaofeng Wang, Wei Wang, Jianke Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant popularity for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, primarily due to their potential to significantly reduce memory and computational overheads. However, a common limitation in most PEFT approaches is their application of a uniform architectural design across all layers. This uniformity involves identical trainable modules and ignores the varying importance of each layer, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning results. To overcome the above limitation and obtain better performance, we develop a novel approach, Importance-aware Sparse Tuning (IST), to fully utilize the inherent sparsity and select the most important subset of full layers with effective layer-wise importance scoring. The proposed IST is a versatile and plug-and-play technique compatible with various PEFT methods that operate on a per-layer basis. By leveraging the estimated importance scores, IST dynamically updates these selected layers in PEFT modules, leading to reduced memory demands. We further provide theoretical proof of convergence and empirical evidence of superior performance to demonstrate the advantages of IST over uniform updating strategies. Extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, PEFTs, and downstream tasks substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing IST's capacity to enhance existing layer-based PEFT methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11779">MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Wang, Xiang Chen, Ningyu Zhang, Bozhong Tian, Haoming Xu, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs (DeCo), which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tsz Ting Chung, Leyang Cui, Lemao Liu, Xinting Huang, Shuming Shi, Dit-Yan Yeung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks when leveraging in-context learning. To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks, achieving compression rates of up to 10 times while experiencing only a marginal 0.8% decrease in performance. Moreover, it exhibits superior transferability to different models compared to prior work. Additionally, we further analyze how Selection-p helps maintain performance on in-context learning with long contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Han, Tong Zhu, Xiang Zhang, Mengsong Wu, Hao Xiong, Wenliang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) combined with tool learning have gained impressive results in real-world applications. During tool learning, LLMs may call multiple tools in nested orders, where the latter tool call may take the former response as its input parameters. However, current research on the nested tool learning capabilities is still under-explored, since the existing benchmarks lack of relevant data instances. To address this problem, we introduce NesTools to bridge the current gap in comprehensive nested tool learning evaluations. NesTools comprises a novel automatic data generation method to construct large-scale nested tool calls with different nesting structures. With manual review and refinement, the dataset is in high quality and closely aligned with real-world scenarios. Therefore, NesTools can serve as a new benchmark to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 22 LLMs, and provide in-depth analyses with NesTools, which shows that current LLMs still suffer from the complex nested tool learning task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangqi Duan, Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Hicks, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student's code submission passes each test case and 2) the student's open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keivan Alizadeh, Iman Mirzadeh, Hooman Shahrokhi, Dmitry Belenko, Frank Sun, Minsik Cho, Mohammad Hossein Sekhavat, Moin Nabi, Mehrdad Farajtabar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically generate outputs token by token using a fixed compute budget, leading to inefficient resource utilization. To address this shortcoming, recent advancements in mixture of expert (MoE) models, speculative decoding, and early exit strategies leverage the insight that computational demands can vary significantly based on the complexity and nature of the input. However, identifying optimal routing patterns for dynamic execution remains an open challenge, limiting the full potential of these adaptive methods. To address this need, we study adaptive computation in LLMs more systematically. We propose a novel framework that integrates smaller auxiliary modules within each Feed-Forward Network layer of the LLM. This design enables dynamic routing of tokens based on task complexity: tokens can be processed by either the small or big modules at each layer, or even bypass certain layers entirely. This allows us to introduce a novel notion of a token's difficulty, defined by its potential to benefit from additional computational resources. Importantly, by employing oracles to identify optimal patterns of adaptive computations, we gain valuable insights into the internal workings of LLMs and the routing processes in a simplified heterogeneous MoE setup. We show that trained routers operate differently from oracles and often yield suboptimal solutions. Notably, activating a large module in just one layer outperforms models that use large modules across all layers, underscoring the gap between practical implementations of routing in MoE models and theoretical optima for adaptive computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Li, Jianhang Hong, Yuanzhuo Wu, Snehal Adbol, Zonglin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Model compression methods are used to reduce the computation and energy requirements for Large Language Models (LLMs). Quantization Aware Training (QAT), an effective model compression method, is proposed to reduce performance degradation after quantization. To further minimize this degradation, we introduce two continuous approximations to the QAT process on the rounding function, traditionally approximated by the Straight-Through Estimator (STE), and the clamping function. By applying both methods, the perplexity (PPL) on the WikiText-v2 dataset of the quantized model reaches 9.0815, outperforming 9.9621 by the baseline. Also, we achieve a 2.76% improvement on BoolQ, and a 5.47% improvement on MMLU, proving that the step sizes and weights can be learned more accurately with our approach. Our method achieves better performance with the same precision, model size, and training setup, contributing to the development of more energy-efficient LLMs technology that aligns with global sustainability goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Qiao, Zhizhong Zhang, Xin Tan, Yanyun Qu, Shouhong Ding, Yuan Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning guides the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in aligning different modalities by designing text instructions, which seems to be an essential technique to enhance the capabilities and controllability of foundation models. In this framework, Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) is adopted to continually instruct MLLMs to follow human intent in sequential datasets. We observe existing gradient update would heavily destroy the tuning performance on previous datasets and the zero-shot ability during continual instruction tuning. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) update policy owns the ability to trace previous parameters, which can aid in decreasing forgetting. However, its stable balance weight cannot deal with the ever-changing datasets, leading to the out-of-balance between plasticity and stability of MLLMs. In this paper, we propose a method called Multimodal Large Language Continual Assistant (LLaCA) to address the challenge. Starting from the trade-off prerequisite and EMA update, we propose the plasticity and stability ideal condition. Based on Taylor expansion in the loss function, we find the optimal balance weight is basically according to the gradient information and previous parameters. We automatically determine the balance weight and significantly improve the performance. Through comprehensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5 in a continual visual-question-answering benchmark, compared with baseline, our approach not only highly improves anti-forgetting ability (with reducing forgetting from 22.67 to 2.68), but also significantly promotes continual tuning performance (with increasing average accuracy from 41.31 to 61.89). Our code will be published soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingliang Liang, Martha Larson</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Word-Frequency-based Image-Text Pair Pruning (WFPP), a novel data pruning method that improves the efficiency of VLMs. Unlike MetaCLIP, our method does not need metadata for pruning, but selects text-image pairs to prune based on the content of the text. Specifically, WFPP prunes text-image pairs containing high-frequency words across the entire training dataset. The effect of WFPP is to reduce the dominance of frequent words. The result a better balanced word-frequency distribution in the dataset, which is known to improve the training of word embedding models. After pre-training on the pruned subset, we fine-tuned the model on the entire dataset for one additional epoch to achieve better performance. Our experiments demonstrate that applying WFPP when training a CLIP model improves performance on a wide range of downstream tasks. WFPP also provides the advantage of speeding up pre-training by using fewer samples. Additionally, we analyze the training data before and after pruning to visualize how WFPP changes the balance of word frequencies. We hope our work encourages researchers to consider the distribution of words in the training data when pre-training VLMs, not limited to CLIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxin Ding, Yue Fang, Runchuan Zhu, Xinke Jiang, Jinyang Zhang, Yongxin Xu, Xu Chu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle in specialized domains like healthcare due to limited domain-specific knowledge.Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT) data construction for domain adaptation often relies on heuristic methods, such as GPT-4 annotation or manual data selection, with a data-centric focus on presumed diverse, high-quality datasets. However, these methods overlook the model's inherent knowledge distribution, introducing noise, redundancy, and irrelevant data, leading to a mismatch between the selected data and the model's learning task, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage model-centric data selection framework, Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection (3DS), which aligns data with the model's knowledge distribution for optimized adaptation. In Stage1, we apply Prompt-Driven Data Selection via Explicit Alignment, where the the model filters irrelevant or redundant data based on its internal knowledge. In Stage2, we perform Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection, where data selection is guided by our defined difficulty decomposition, using three metrics: Instruction Understanding, Response Confidence, and Response Correctness. Additionally, an attention-based importance weighting mechanism captures token importance for more accurate difficulty calibration. This two-stage approach ensures the selected data is not only aligned with the model's knowledge and preferences but also appropriately challenging for the model to learn, leading to more effective and targeted domain adaptation. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3DS over exisiting methods in accuracy by over 5.29%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Yuan, Hongteng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer plays a central role in many fundamental deep learning models, e.g., the ViT in computer vision and the BERT and GPT in natural language processing, whose effectiveness is mainly attributed to its multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. In this study, we propose a simple and novel channel-wise sample permutation (CSP) operator, achieving a new structured MHA with fewer parameters and lower complexity. Given an input matrix, CSP circularly shifts the samples of different channels with various steps and then sorts grouped samples of each channel. This operator is equivalent to implicitly implementing cross-channel attention maps as permutation matrices, which achieves linear complexity and suppresses the risk of rank collapse when representing data. We replace the MHA of some representative models with CSP and test the CSP-based models in several discriminative tasks, including image classification and long sequence analysis. Experiments show that the CSP-based models achieve comparable or better performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than the classic Transformer and its state-of-the-art variants.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liubov Tupikina (UPD5, LPI), Kathuria Hritika (LPI)</p>
<p>Abstract: Active area of research in AI is the theory of manifold learning and finding lower-dimensional manifold representation on how we can learn geometry from data for providing better quality curated datasets. There are however various issues with these methods related to finding low-dimensional representation of the data, the so-called curse of dimensionality. Geometric deep learning methods for data learning often include set of assumptions on the geometry of the feature space. Some of these assumptions include pre-selected metrics on the feature space, usage of the underlying graph structure, which encodes the data points proximity. However, the later assumption of using a graph as the underlying discrete structure, encodes only the binary pairwise relations between data points, restricting ourselves from capturing more complex higher-order relationships, which are often often present in various systems. These assumptions together with data being discrete and finite can cause some generalisations, which are likely to create wrong interpretations of the data and models outputs. Hence overall this can cause wrong outputs of the embedding models themselves, while these models being quite and trained on large corpora of data, such as BERT, Yi and other similar models.The objective of our research is twofold, first, it is to develop the alternative framework to characterize the embedding methods dissecting their possible inconsistencies using combinatorial approach of higher-order structures which encode the embedded data. Second objective is to explore the assumption of the underlying structure of embeddings to be graphs, substituting it with the hypergraph and using the hypergraph theory to analyze this structure. We also demonstrate the embedding characterization on the usecase of the arXiv data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Qin, Zhaomin Wu, Bingsheng He, Shuiguang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning helps improve pretrained large language models (LLMs) in terms of the responsiveness to human instructions, which is benefited from diversified instruction data. Federated learning extends the sources of instruction data by exploiting the diversified client-side data, making it increasingly popular for tuning LLMs. Existing approaches of federated LLM tuning typically traverse all local data during local training, bringing excessive computation overhead and posing a risk of overfitting local data. Thus, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which consumes relatively little data from the entire dataset, is needed. In response, this work introduces an approach of federated data-efficient instruction tuning for LLMs, FedHDS, which utilizes a representative subset of edge-side data, coreset, to tune the LLM. It reduces the redundancy of data samples at both intra-client and inter-client levels through a hierarchical data selection framework performed by jointly selecting a small number of representative data samples for local training without sharing the raw data. Extensive experiments conducted across six scenarios with various LLMs, datasets and data partitions demonstrate that FedHDS significantly reduces the amount of data required for fine-tuning while improving the responsiveness of the instruction-tuned LLMs to unseen tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that state space models such as Mamba are significantly worse than Transformers on recall-based tasks due to the fact that their state size is constant with respect to their input sequence length. But in practice, state space models have fairly large state sizes, and we conjecture that they should be able to perform much better at these tasks than previously reported. We investigate whether their poor copying and recall performance could be due in part to training difficulties rather than fundamental capacity constraints. Based on observations of their "attention" maps, we propose a structured initialization technique that allows state space layers to more readily mimic attention. Across a variety of architecture settings, our initialization makes it substantially easier for Mamba to learn to copy and do associative recall from scratch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Target-speaker speech processing (TS) tasks, such as target-speaker automatic speech recognition (TS-ASR), target speech extraction (TSE), and personal voice activity detection (p-VAD), are important for extracting information about a desired speaker's speech even when it is corrupted by interfering speakers. While most studies have focused on training schemes or system architectures for each specific task, the auxiliary network for embedding target-speaker cues has not been investigated comprehensively in a unified cross-task evaluation. Therefore, this paper aims to address a fundamental question: what is the preferred speaker embedding for TS tasks? To this end, for the TS-ASR, TSE, and p-VAD tasks, we compare pre-trained speaker encoders (i.e., self-supervised or speaker recognition models) that compute speaker embeddings from pre-recorded enrollment speech of the target speaker with ideal speaker embeddings derived directly from the target speaker's identity in the form of a one-hot vector. To further understand the properties of ideal speaker embedding, we optimize it using a gradient-based approach to improve performance on the TS task. Our analysis reveals that speaker verification performance is somewhat unrelated to TS task performances, the one-hot vector outperforms enrollment-based ones, and the optimal embedding depends on the input mixture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in enhancing various aspects of our daily lives, from conversational AI to search and AI assistants. However, their growing capabilities come at the cost of extremely large model sizes, making deployment on edge devices challenging due to memory and computational constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to LLM weight pruning that directly optimizes for approximating the attention matrix, a core component of transformer architectures. Unlike existing methods that focus on linear approximations, our approach accounts for the non-linear nature of the Softmax attention mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our Gradient Descent-based optimization method to a near-optimal pruning mask solution. Our preliminary empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in maintaining model performance while significantly reducing computational costs. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for pruning algorithm design in LLMs, potentially paving the way for more efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the study of LLMs, sycophancy represents a prevalent hallucination that poses significant challenges to these models. Specifically, LLMs often fail to adhere to original correct responses, instead blindly agreeing with users' opinions, even when those opinions are incorrect or malicious. However, research on sycophancy in visual language models (VLMs) has been scarce. In this work, we extend the exploration of sycophancy from LLMs to VLMs, introducing the MM-SY benchmark to evaluate this phenomenon. We present evaluation results from multiple representative models, addressing the gap in sycophancy research for VLMs. To mitigate sycophancy, we propose a synthetic dataset for training and employ methods based on prompts, supervised fine-tuning, and DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods effectively alleviate sycophancy in VLMs. Additionally, we probe VLMs to assess the semantic impact of sycophancy and analyze the attention distribution of visual tokens. Our findings indicate that the ability to prevent sycophancy is predominantly observed in higher layers of the model. The lack of attention to image knowledge in these higher layers may contribute to sycophancy, and enhancing image attention at high layers proves beneficial in mitigating this issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifan Liu, Amin Karbasi, Theodoros Rekatsinas</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning foundation models for specific tasks is an emerging paradigm in modern machine learning. The efficacy of task-specific finetuning largely depends on the selection of appropriate training data. We present a framework to select data for task-specific model finetuning, guided by a small but representative set of examples from the target task. To do so, we formulate data selection for task-specific finetuning as an optimization problem with a distribution alignment loss based on optimal transport to capture the discrepancy between the selected data and the target distribution. In addition, we add a regularizer to encourage the diversity of the selected data and incorporate kernel density estimation into the regularizer to reduce the negative effects of near-duplicates among the candidate data. We connect our optimization problem to nearest neighbor search and design efficient algorithms to compute the optimal solution based on approximate nearest neighbor search techniques. We evaluate our method on data selection for both continued pretraining and instruction tuning of language models. We show that instruction tuning using data selected by our method with a 1% selection ratio often outperforms using the full dataset and beats the baseline selection methods by 1.5 points in F1 score on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhang Li, Xiaochen Yang, Wangmeng Zuo, Yiwen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic adversarial prompt generation provides remarkable success in jailbreaking safely-aligned large language models (LLMs). Existing gradient-based attacks, while demonstrating outstanding performance in jailbreaking white-box LLMs, often generate garbled adversarial prompts with chaotic appearance. These adversarial prompts are difficult to transfer to other LLMs, hindering their performance in attacking unknown victim models. In this paper, for the first time, we delve into the semantic meaning embedded in garbled adversarial prompts and propose a novel method that "translates" them into coherent and human-readable natural language adversarial prompts. In this way, we can effectively uncover the semantic information that triggers vulnerabilities of the model and unambiguously transfer it to the victim model, without overlooking the adversarial information hidden in the garbled text, to enhance jailbreak attacks. It also offers a new approach to discovering effective designs for jailbreak prompts, advancing the understanding of jailbreak attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the success rate of jailbreak attacks against various safety-aligned LLMs and outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins. With at most 10 queries, our method achieves an average attack success rate of 81.8% in attacking 7 commercial closed-source LLMs, including GPT and Claude-3 series, on HarmBench. Our method also achieves over 90% attack success rates against Llama-2-Chat models on AdvBench, despite their outstanding resistance to jailbreak attacks.

<p>Abstract: The fashion industry is one of the leading domains in the global e-commerce sector, prompting major online retailers to employ recommendation systems for product suggestions and customer convenience. While recommendation systems have been widely studied, most are designed for general e-commerce problems and struggle with the unique challenges of the fashion domain. To address these issues, we propose a sequential fashion recommendation framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) enhanced with recommendation-specific prompts. Our framework employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning with extensive fashion data and introduces a novel mix-up-based retrieval technique for translating text into relevant product suggestions. Extensive experiments show our proposed framework significantly enhances fashion recommendation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minoo Jafarlou, Mario M. Kubek</p>
<p>Abstract: Labeling datasets is a noteworthy challenge in machine learning, both in terms of cost and time. This research, however, leverages an efficient answer. By exploring label propagation in semi-supervised learning, we can significantly reduce the number of labels required compared to traditional methods. We employ a transductive label propagation method based on the manifold assumption for text classification. Our approach utilizes a graph-based method to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data for the text classification task, which are then used to train deep neural networks. By extending labels based on cosine proximity within a nearest neighbor graph from network embeddings, we combine unlabeled data into supervised learning, thereby reducing labeling costs. Based on previous successes in other domains, this study builds and evaluates this approach's effectiveness in sentiment analysis, presenting insights into semi-supervised learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: To facilitate natural and intuitive interactions with diverse user groups in real-world settings, social robots must be capable of addressing the varying requirements and expectations of these groups while adapting their behavior based on user feedback. While previous research often focuses on specific demographics, we present a novel framework for adaptive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) that tailors interactions to different user groups and enables individual users to modulate interactions through both minor and major interruptions. Our primary contributions include the development of an adaptive, ROS-based HRI framework with an open-source code base. This framework supports natural interactions through advanced speech recognition and voice activity detection, and leverages a large language model (LLM) as a dialogue bridge. We validate the efficiency of our framework through module tests and system trials, demonstrating its high accuracy in age recognition and its robustness to repeated user inputs and plan changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Wuzhenghong, Zhang Yongpan, Pan Su, Sun Yuwei, Lu Pengwei, Ding Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models revolutionize Text2SQL through supervised fine-tuning, yet a crucial limitation is overlooked: the complexity of databases leads to an increased context length, consequently resulting in higher GPU memory demands for model fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LR-SQL. LR-SQL comprises two supervised fine-tuning models: the schema\_link model and the SQL\_generation model, with the schema\_link model serving as the focal point for streamlining the overall process. During the fine-tuning of the schema\_link model, LR-SQL breaks down the complete database into flexible combinations of tables with adjustable quantities, enabling the model to learn the relationships within the entire database from these dispersed slices. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to perceive the relationships among various discrete slices during inference, LR-SQL trains the model's Chain-of-Thought capability for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that LR-SQL can reduce the total GPU memory usage by 40\% compared to existing fine-tuning methods, while only losing 2\% of table prediction accuracy in schema\_link task. For the overall Text2SQL task, the Execution Accuracy decrease by 0.6\%.Our project is now available on https://github.com/hongWin/LR-SQL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanying Wang, Zeyu Ma, Pengfei Liu, Mingang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant in addressing real-world user needs. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, purposeless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two definitions: **Benchmark+**, which extends traditional QA benchmarks into a more flexible ``strategy-criterion'' format; and **Assessment+**, which enhances the interaction process for greater exploration and enables both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights that capture nuanced target LLM behaviors from richer multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called *TestAgent*, which implements these two concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from building vertical domain evaluation from scratch to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of *TestAgent* across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Advanced utilization of the knowledge embedded in LLMs for automated annotation has consistently been explored. This study proposed to develop an emotion lexicon for Cantonese, a low-resource language, through collaborative efforts between LLM and human annotators. By integrating emotion labels provided by LLM and human annotators, the study leveraged existing linguistic resources including lexicons in other languages and local forums to construct a Cantonese emotion lexicon enriched with colloquial expressions. The consistency of the proposed emotion lexicon in emotion extraction was assessed through modification and utilization of three distinct emotion text datasets. This study not only validates the efficacy of the constructed lexicon but also emphasizes that collaborative annotation between human and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the quality of emotion labels, highlighting the potential of such partnerships in facilitating natural language processing tasks for low-resource languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in general tasks across various fields. However, their effectiveness within specific domains such as drug development remains challenges. To solve these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Y-Mol}, forming a well-established LLM paradigm for the flow of drug development. Y-Mol is a multiscale biomedical knowledge-guided LLM designed to accomplish tasks across lead compound discovery, pre-clinic, and clinic prediction. By integrating millions of multiscale biomedical knowledge and using LLaMA2 as the base LLM, Y-Mol augments the reasoning capability in the biomedical domain by learning from a corpus of publications, knowledge graphs, and expert-designed synthetic data. The capability is further enriched with three types of drug-oriented instructions: description-based prompts from processed publications, semantic-based prompts for extracting associations from knowledge graphs, and template-based prompts for understanding expert knowledge from biomedical tools. Besides, Y-Mol offers a set of LLM paradigms that can autonomously execute the downstream tasks across the entire process of drug development, including virtual screening, drug design, pharmacological properties prediction, and drug-related interaction prediction. Our extensive evaluations of various biomedical sources demonstrate that Y-Mol significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs in discovering lead compounds, predicting molecular properties, and identifying drug interaction events.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently retrieving and synthesizing information from large-scale multimodal collections has become a critical challenge. However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have opened new avenues for applications in Embodied AI. Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihang Li, Haowen Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately understanding complex visual information is crucial for visual language models (VLMs). Enhancing image resolution can improve visual perception capabilities, not only reducing hallucinations but also boosting performance in tasks that demand high resolution, such as text-rich or document analysis. In this paper, we present VisualRWKV-HD and VisualRWKV-UHD, two advancements in the VisualRWKV model family, specifically designed to process high-resolution visual inputs. For VisualRWKV-HD, we developed a lossless downsampling method to effectively integrate a high-resolution vision encoder with low-resolution encoders, without extending the input sequence length. For the VisualRWKV-UHD model, we enhanced image representation by dividing the image into four segments, which are then recombined with the original image. This technique allows the model to incorporate both high-resolution and low-resolution features, effectively balancing coarse and fine-grained information. As a result, the model supports resolutions up to 4096 x 4096 pixels, offering a more detailed and comprehensive visual processing capability. Both VisualRWKV-HD and VisualRWKV-UHD not only achieve strong results on VLM benchmarks but also show marked improvements in performance for text-rich tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mar\'ia Victoria Carro, Francisca Gauna Selasco, Denise Alejandra Mester, Mario Alejandro Leiva</p>
<p>Abstract: Illusions of causality occur when people develop the belief that there is a causal connection between two variables with no supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been proposed to underlie many societal problems including social prejudice, stereotype formation, misinformation and superstitious thinking. In this research we investigate whether large language models develop the illusion of causality in real-world settings. We evaluated and compared news headlines generated by GPT-4o-Mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro to determine whether the models incorrectly framed correlations as causal relationships. In order to also measure sycophantic behavior, which occurs when a model aligns with a user's beliefs in order to look favorable even if it is not objectively correct, we additionally incorporated the bias into the prompts, observing if this manipulation increases the likelihood of the models exhibiting the illusion of causality. We found that Claude-3.5-Sonnet is the model that presents the lowest degree of causal illusion aligned with experiments on Correlation-to-Causation Exaggeration in human-written press releases. On the other hand, our findings suggest that while mimicry sycophancy increases the likelihood of causal illusions in these models, especially in GPT-4o-Mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet remains the most robust against this cognitive bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Latent Action Pretraining for general Action models (LAPA), an unsupervised method for pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models without ground-truth robot action labels. Existing Vision-Language-Action models require action labels typically collected by human teleoperators during pretraining, which significantly limits possible data sources and scale. In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions. Training only on human manipulation videos also shows positive transfer, opening up the potential for leveraging web-scale data for robotics foundation model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling laws predict the loss of a target machine learning model by extrapolating from easier-to-train models with fewer parameters or smaller training sets. This provides an efficient way for practitioners and researchers alike to compare pretraining decisions involving optimizers, datasets, and model architectures. Despite the widespread use of scaling laws to model the dynamics of language model training, there has been little work on understanding how to best estimate and interpret them. We collect (and release) a large-scale dataset containing losses and downstream evaluations for 485 previously published pretrained models. We use these to estimate more than 1000 scaling laws, then derive a set of best practices for estimating scaling laws in new model families. We find that fitting scaling laws to intermediate checkpoints of training runs (and not just their final losses) substantially improves accuracy, and that -- all else equal -- estimates of performance are generally most accurate when derived from other models of similar sizes. However, because there is a significant degree of variability across model seeds, training multiple small models is sometimes more useful than training a single large one. Moreover, while different model families differ scaling behavior, they are often similar enough that a target model's behavior can be predicted from a single model with the same architecture, along with scaling parameter estimates derived from other model families.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming research on machine learning while galvanizing public debates. Understanding not only when these models work well and succeed but also why they fail and misbehave is of great societal relevance. We propose to turn the lens of psychiatry, a framework used to describe and modify maladaptive behavior, to the outputs produced by these models. We focus on twelve established LLMs and subject them to a questionnaire commonly used in psychiatry. Our results show that six of the latest LLMs respond robustly to the anxiety questionnaire, producing comparable anxiety scores to humans. Moreover, the LLMs' responses can be predictably changed by using anxiety-inducing prompts. Anxiety-induction not only influences LLMs' scores on an anxiety questionnaire but also influences their behavior in a previously-established benchmark measuring biases such as racism and ageism. Importantly, greater anxiety-inducing text leads to stronger increases in biases, suggesting that how anxiously a prompt is communicated to large language models has a strong influence on their behavior in applied settings. These results demonstrate the usefulness of methods taken from psychiatry for studying the capable algorithms to which we increasingly delegate authority and autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao A. Leite, Olesya Razuvayevskaya, Kalina Bontcheva, Carolina Scarton</p>
<p>Abstract: Credibility signals represent a wide range of heuristics typically used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content. Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yike Wang, Shangbin Feng, Heng Wang, Weijia Shi, Vidhisha Balachandran, Tianxing He, Yulia Tsvetkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often encounter knowledge conflicts, scenarios where discrepancy arises between the internal parametric knowledge of LLMs and non-parametric information provided in the prompt context. In this work we ask what are the desiderata for LLMs when a knowledge conflict arises and whether existing LLMs fulfill them. We posit that LLMs should 1) identify knowledge conflicts, 2) pinpoint conflicting information segments, and 3) provide distinct answers or viewpoints in conflicting scenarios. To this end, we introduce an evaluation framework for simulating contextual knowledge conflicts and quantitatively evaluating to what extent LLMs achieve these goals. It includes diverse and complex situations of knowledge conflict, knowledge from diverse entities and domains, two synthetic conflict creation methods, and settings with progressively increasing difficulty to reflect realistic knowledge conflicts. Extensive experiments with the framework reveal that while LLMs perform well in identifying the existence of knowledge conflicts, they struggle to determine the specific conflicting knowledge and produce a response with distinct answers amidst conflicting information. To address these challenges, we propose new instruction-based approaches that augment LLMs to better achieve the three goals. Further analysis shows that abilities to tackle knowledge conflicts are greatly impacted by factors such as knowledge domain, while generating robust responses to knowledge conflict scenarios remains an open research question.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deniz Bayazit, Negar Foroutan, Zeming Chen, Gail Weiss, Antoine Bosselut</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) encode implicit representations of knowledge in their parameters. However, localizing these representations and disentangling them from each other remains an open problem. In this work, we investigate whether pretrained language models contain various knowledge-critical subnetworks: particular sparse computational subgraphs that can, if removed, precisely suppress specific knowledge the model has memorized. We propose a multi-objective differentiable masking scheme that can be applied to both weights and neurons to discover such subnetworks and show that we can use them to precisely remove specific knowledge from models while minimizing adverse effects on the behavior of the original model. We demonstrate our method on multiple GPT2 variants, uncovering highly sparse subnetworks (98%+ sparsity) that are critical for expressing specific collections of relational knowledge. When these subnetworks are removed, the remaining network maintains most of its initial abilities but struggles to represent the suppressed knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanjie Zhao, Jinge Xie, Yuchen Yan, Yuxiang Jia, Yawen Ye, Hongying Zan</p>
<p>Abstract: Entities like person, location, organization are important for literary text analysis. The lack of annotated data hinders the progress of named entity recognition (NER) in literary domain. To promote the research of literary NER, we build the largest multi-genre literary NER corpus containing 263,135 entities in 105,851 sentences from 260 online Chinese novels spanning 13 different genres. Based on the corpus, we investigate characteristics of entities from different genres. We propose several baseline NER models and conduct cross-genre and cross-domain experiments. Experimental results show that genre difference significantly impact NER performance though not as much as domain difference like literary domain and news domain. Compared with NER in news domain, literary NER still needs much improvement and the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem is more challenging due to the high variety of entities in literary works.

<p>Abstract: We present ComplexityNet, a streamlined language model designed for assessing task complexity. This model predicts the likelihood of accurate output by various language models, each with different capabilities. Our initial application of ComplexityNet involves the Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP) dataset. We pioneered the creation of the first set of labels to define task complexity. ComplexityNet achieved a notable 79% accuracy in determining task complexity, a significant improvement over the 34% accuracy of the original, non fine-tuned model. Furthermore, ComplexityNet effectively reduces computational resource usage by 90% compared to using the highest complexity model, while maintaining a high code generation accuracy of 86.7%. This study demonstrates that fine-tuning smaller models to categorize tasks based on their complexity can lead to a more balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the use of Large Language Models. Our findings suggest a promising direction for optimizing LLM applications, especially in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raymond Douglas, Andis Draguns, Tom\'a\v{s} Gaven\v{c}iak</p>
<p>Abstract: The broad capabilities of Language Models (LMs) can be limited by their sensitivity to distractor tasks: LMs can infer secondary tasks from the prompt in addition to the intended one, leading to unwanted outputs. For example, prompt injection attacks can cause models to deviate from explicit directives. In some 'inverse scaling' cases, this unwanted behaviour actually worsens as models scale up to at least 540B parameters. We present a theoretical framework that interprets LMs as a product of experts that combine multiple data generation processes. Based on this framework, we demonstrate prior-aware decoding (PAD) - a simple contrastive inference method to reduce the influence of distractor tasks. We apply PAD to eleven models, across four datasets, and find improvements in 41 out of 44 task-model combinations, with a median increase in task completion proportion of 40%. The results suggest a promising direction for further development towards more reliable language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Yang, Zouying Cao, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on transformer are witnessing a notable trend of size expansion, which brings considerable costs to both model training and inference. However, existing methods such as model quantization, knowledge distillation, and model pruning are constrained by various issues, including hardware support limitations, the need for extensive training, and alterations to the model internal structure. In this paper, we propose a concise layer-wise structured pruner called \textit{Layer Collapse (LaCo)}, in which rear model layers collapse into a prior layer, enabling a rapid reduction in model size while preserving the model structure. Comprehensive experiments show that our method maintains an average task performance of over 80\% at pruning ratios of 25-30\%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art structured pruning methods. We also conduct post-training experiments to confirm that the \textit{LaCo} effectively inherits the parameters of the original model. Additionally, we perform ablation studies on various settings of \textit{LaCo}. Finally, we discuss our motivation from the perspective of layer-wise similarity and evaluate the performance of the pruned LLMs across various pruning ratios\footnote{\url{https://github.com/yangyifei729/LaCo}}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Wu, Linyi Yang, Zhen Wang, Manabu Okumura, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, their real reasoning abilities on multiple evidence retrieval and integration on Multi-hop QA tasks remain less explored. Firstly, LLMs sometimes generate answers that rely on internal memory rather than retrieving evidence and reasoning in the given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation quality of real reasoning abilities. Although previous counterfactual QA benchmarks can separate the internal memory of LLMs, they focus solely on final QA performance, which is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning abilities. Because LLMs are expected to engage in intricate reasoning processes that involve evidence retrieval and answering a series of sub-questions from given passages. Moreover, current factual Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are annotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for multi-step reasoning evaluation, they show limitations due to the potential data contamination in LLMs' pre-training stage. To address these issues, we introduce a Step-wise Counterfactual benchmark (CofCA), a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of factual data and counterfactual data that reveals LLMs' real reasoning abilities on multi-step reasoning and reasoning chain evaluation. Our experimental results reveal a significant performance gap of several LLMs between Wikipedia-based factual data and counterfactual data, deeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs usually bypass the correct reasoning chain, showing an inflated multi-step reasoning performance. We believe that our CofCA benchmark will enhance and facilitate the evaluations of trustworthy LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilin Zhao, Yuxiang Huang, Xu Han, Wang Xu, Chaojun Xiao, Xinrong Zhang, Yewei Fang, Kaihuo Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely used method that accelerates the generation process of large language models (LLMs) with no compromise in model performance. It achieves this goal by using an existing smaller model for drafting and then employing the target LLM to verify the draft in a low-cost parallel manner. Under such a drafting-verification framework, drafting efficiency has become a bottleneck in the final speedup of speculative decoding. Therefore, generating longer drafts at less cost can lead to better decoding speedup. To achieve this, we introduce Ouroboros, which can generate draft phrases to parallelize the drafting process and meanwhile lengthen drafts in a training-free manner. The experimental results on various typical text generation tasks show that Ouroboros can achieve speedups of up to $2.8\times$ over speculative decoding and $3.9\times$ over vanilla decoding, without fine-tuning draft and target models. The source code of Ouroboros is available at https://github.com/thunlp/Ouroboros.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enora Rice, Ali Marashian, Luke Gessler, Alexis Palmer, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: Canonical morphological segmentation is the process of analyzing words into the standard (aka underlying) forms of their constituent morphemes. This is a core task in language documentation, and NLP systems have the potential to dramatically speed up this process. But in typical language documentation settings, training data for canonical morpheme segmentation is scarce, making it difficult to train high quality models. However, translation data is often much more abundant, and, in this work, we present a method that attempts to leverage this data in the canonical segmentation task. We propose a character-level sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates representations of translations obtained from pretrained high-resource monolingual language models as an additional signal. Our model outperforms the baseline in a super-low resource setting but yields mixed results on training splits with more data. While further work is needed to make translations useful in higher-resource settings, our model shows promise in severely resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for fake news detection have significantly contributed to the advancement of models in assessing the authenticity of news content. However, these benchmarks typically focus solely on news pertaining to a single semantic topic or originating from a single platform, thereby failing to capture the diversity of multi-domain news in real scenarios. In order to understand fake news across various domains, the external knowledge and fine-grained annotations are indispensable to provide precise evidence and uncover the diverse underlying strategies for fabrication, which are also ignored by existing benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-domain knowledge-enhanced benchmark with fine-grained annotations, named \textbf{FineFake}. FineFake encompasses 16,909 data samples spanning six semantic topics and eight platforms. Each news item is enriched with multi-modal content, potential social context, semi-manually verified common knowledge, and fine-grained annotations that surpass conventional binary labels. Furthermore, we formulate three challenging tasks based on FineFake and propose a knowledge-enhanced domain adaptation network. Extensive experiments are conducted on FineFake under various scenarios, providing accurate and reliable benchmarks for future endeavors.

Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating age identity information in prompts and observe challenges in mitigating value discrepancies with different age cohorts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihuang Zhong, Kang Wang, Ziyang Xu, Juhua Liu, Liang Ding, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various reasoning tasks. However, CoT still falls short in dealing with complex math word problems, as it usually suffers from three pitfalls: semantic misunderstanding errors, calculation errors, and step-missing errors. Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the reasoning performance of LLMs. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse reasoning benchmarks show that our DUP method consistently outperforms the other counterparts by a large margin. More encouragingly, DUP achieves a new SOTA result on the GSM8K benchmark, with an accuracy of 97.1% under the zero-shot setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automating data generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly popular. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-based data generation in the challenging setting of source-grounded information-seeking dialogs, with response attribution, over long documents. Our source texts consist of long and noisy meeting transcripts, adding to the task complexity. Since automating attribution remains difficult, we propose a semi-automatic approach: dialog queries and responses are generated with LLMs, followed by human verification and identification of attribution spans. Using this approach, we created MISeD -- Meeting Information Seeking Dialogs dataset -- a dataset of information-seeking dialogs focused on meeting transcripts. Models finetuned with MISeD demonstrate superior performance compared to off-the-shelf models, even those of larger size. Finetuning on MISeD gives comparable response generation quality to finetuning on fully manual data, while improving attribution quality and reducing time and effort.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained language models have become an integral component of question-answering systems, achieving remarkable performance. However, for practical deployment, it is crucial to perform knowledge distillation to maintain high performance while operating under computational constraints. In this paper, we address a key question: given the importance of unsupervised distillation for student model performance, how can knowledge from multiple teacher models be effectively ensemble during this stage without the guidance of labels? We propose a novel algorithm, GOVERN, to tackle this issue. GOVERN has demonstrated significant improvements in both offline and online experiments, enabling the student model to achieve results comparable to that of teacher ensembles. Our experiments show that GOVERN remarkably requires a mere 1\% of the ensemble method's inference budget to achieve 99.5\% of performance. The proposed algorithm has been successfully deployed in a real-world commercial question-answering system, demonstrating its real-world applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the medical domain, numerous scenarios necessitate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, when addressing patients' questions, it is essential that the model's response conveys factual claims, highlighting the need for an automated method to evaluate those claims. Thus, we introduce MedLFQA, a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain. We use MedLFQA to facilitate a cost-effective automatic evaluations of factuality. We also propose OLAPH, a simple and novel framework that utilizes cost-effective and multifaceted automatic evaluation to construct a synthetic preference set and answers questions in our preferred manner. Our framework leads us to train LLMs step-by-step to reduce hallucinations and include crucial medical claims. We highlight that, even on evaluation metrics not used during training, LLMs trained with our OLAPH framework demonstrate significant performance improvement in factuality. Our findings reveal that a 7B LLM trained with our OLAPH framework can provide long answers comparable to the medical experts' answers in terms of factuality. We believe that our work could shed light on gauging the long-text generation ability of LLMs in the medical domain. Our code and datasets are available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ``real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiong Yu, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Yuqing Yang, Yongfeng Huang, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jaduk Suh, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Bumsik Kim, Hyemin Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.</p>

To create better sample-label pairs that instruct LLM understanding, we introduce logit separability, a criterion to assess the clarity of both samples and class-related words at the logit level. This facilitates the optimization of sample and label selection, enhancing the precision of information provided in ICL demonstrations. Additionally, we find that incorporating multiple class-related words for each sample, rather than relying on a single class name, improves performance by offering a broader range of label information. Building on these insights, we propose LICL, a logit separability-based method that jointly organizes samples and integrates multiple class-related words into each sample-label pair. Evaluations across seven classification datasets show that this approach significantly improves ICL performance by providing clearer instructions and richer label information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> T. Y. S. S Santosh, Kevin D. Ashley, Katie Atkinson, Matthias Grabmair</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling legal reasoning and argumentation justifying decisions in cases has always been central to AI & Law, yet contemporary developments in legal NLP have increasingly focused on statistically classifying legal conclusions from text. While conceptually simpler, these approaches often fall short in providing usable justifications connecting to appropriate legal concepts. This paper reviews both traditional symbolic works in AI & Law and recent advances in legal NLP, and distills possibilities of integrating expert-informed knowledge to strike a balance between scalability and explanation in symbolic vs. data-driven approaches.

<p>Abstract: Data annotation, the practice of assigning descriptive labels to raw data, is pivotal in optimizing the performance of machine learning models. However, it is a resource-intensive process susceptible to biases introduced by annotators. The emergence of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to modernize and streamline this complex procedure. While existing research extensively evaluates the efficacy of LLMs, as annotators, this paper delves into the biases present in LLMs when annotating hate speech data. Our research contributes to understanding biases in four key categories: gender, race, religion, and disability with four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1 and Gemma-2. Specifically targeting highly vulnerable groups within these categories, we analyze annotator biases. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive examination of potential factors contributing to these biases by scrutinizing the annotated data. We introduce our custom hate speech detection dataset, HateBiasNet, to conduct this research. Additionally, we perform the same experiments on the ETHOS (Mollas et al. 2022) dataset also for comparative analysis. This paper serves as a crucial resource, guiding researchers and practitioners in harnessing the potential of LLMs for data annotation, thereby fostering advancements in this critical field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eldar Kurtic, Amir Moeini, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Mathador-LM, a new benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning on large language models (LLMs), combining ruleset interpretation, planning, and problem-solving. This benchmark is inspired by the Mathador game, where the objective is to reach a target number using basic arithmetic operations on a given set of base numbers, following a simple set of rules. We show that, across leading LLMs, we obtain stable average performance while generating benchmark instances \emph{dynamically}, following a target difficulty level. Thus, our benchmark alleviates concerns about test-set leakage into training data, an issue that often undermines popular benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both open and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs on Mathador-LM. Our findings reveal that contemporary models struggle with Mathador-LM, scoring significantly lower than average 3rd graders. This stands in stark contrast to their strong performance on popular mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The implementation of Mathador-LM benchmark is available at \href{https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Mathador-LM}{github.com/IST-DASLab/Mathador-LM}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuredin Ali, Charles Chuankai Zhang, Ned Mayo, Stevie Chancellor</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media data has been used for detecting users with mental disorders, such as depression. Despite the global significance of cross-cultural representation and its potential impact on model performance, publicly available datasets often lack crucial metadata related to this aspect. In this work, we evaluate the generalization of benchmark datasets to build AI models on cross-cultural Twitter data. We gather a custom geo-located Twitter dataset of depressed users from seven countries as a test dataset. Our results show that depression detection models do not generalize globally. The models perform worse on Global South users compared to Global North. Pre-trained language models achieve the best generalization compared to Logistic Regression, though still show significant gaps in performance on depressed and non-Western users. We quantify our findings and provide several actionable suggestions to mitigate this issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Hu, Sizhe Liu, Changjiang Gao, Xin Huang, Xue Han, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Shujian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across multiple languages. However, the relationship between capabilities in different languages is less explored. In this work, we decompose the process of reasoning tasks into two separated components: knowledge retrieval and knowledge-free reasoning, and analyze the relationship between cross-lingual transferability and these two components. With adapted commonsense reasoning datasets and constructed knowledge-free reasoning datasets, we show that the knowledge-free reasoning capability can be nearly perfectly transferred across various source-target language directions despite the secondary impact of resource in some specific target languages, while cross-lingual knowledge retrieval significantly hinders the transfer. Moreover, by analyzing the hidden states and feed-forward network neuron activation during the reasoning, we show that higher similarity of hidden representations and larger overlap of activated neurons could explain the better cross-lingual transferability of knowledge-free reasoning than knowledge retrieval. Thus, we hypothesize that knowledge-free reasoning shares similar neurons in different languages for reasoning, while knowledge is stored separately in different languages.

<p>Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPA) have been a popular application area for large language models (LLMs), attracting significant interest from both industry and academia.While existing RPAs well portray the characters' knowledge and tones, they face challenges in capturing their minds, especially for small role-playing language models (RPLMs). In this paper, we propose to enhance RPLMs via personality-indicative data. Specifically, we leverage questions from psychological scales and distill advanced RPAs to generate dialogues that grasp the minds of characters. Experimental results validate that RPLMs trained with our dataset exhibit advanced role-playing capabilities for both general and personality-related evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Yang Xu, Bela Gipp</p>
<p>Abstract: Much of the success of modern language models depends on finding a suitable prompt to instruct the model. Until now, it has been largely unknown how variations in the linguistic expression of prompts affect these models. This study systematically and empirically evaluates which linguistic features influence models through paraphrase types, i.e., different linguistic changes at particular positions. We measure behavioral changes for five models across 120 tasks and six families of paraphrases (i.e., morphology, syntax, lexicon, lexico-syntax, discourse, and others). We also control for other prompt engineering factors (e.g., prompt length, lexical diversity, and proximity to training data). Our results show a potential for language models to improve tasks when their prompts are adapted in specific paraphrase types (e.g., 6.7% median gain in Mixtral 8x7B; 5.5% in LLaMA 3 8B). In particular, changes in morphology and lexicon, i.e., the vocabulary used, showed promise in improving prompts. These findings contribute to developing more robust language models capable of handling variability in linguistic expression.</p>

<p>Abstract: The term Language Models (LMs), as a time-specific collection of models of interest, is constantly reinvented, with its referents updated much like the $\textit{Ship of Theseus}$ replaces its parts but remains the same ship in essence. In this paper, we investigate this $\textit{Ship of Language Models}$ problem, wherein scientific evolution takes the form of continuous, implicit retrofits of key existing terms. We seek to initiate a novel perspective of scientific progress, in addition to the more well-studied emergence of new terms. To this end, we construct the data infrastructure based on recent NLP publications. Then, we perform a series of text-based analyses toward a detailed, quantitative understanding of the use of Language Models as a term of art. Our work highlights how systems and theories influence each other in scientific discourse, and we call for attention to the transformation of this Ship that we all are contributing to.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Fan, Xin Zhong, Yazhe Wan, Chengsi Wang, Haonan Cheng, Gaoche Wu, Ning Ding, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Since LLMs emerged, more attention has been paid to abstractive long-form summarization, where longer input sequences indicate more information contained. Nevertheless, the automatic evaluation of such summaries remains underexplored. The current evaluation metrics for long-form summarization either use similarity-based metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore or LLM-based metrics using appropriate prompts or pre-defined schema. We argue that the former only relies on similarity and fails to consider informativeness while the latter lacks quantitative analysis of informative richness, and is rather subjective and hard to explain. Current evaluation metrics either use traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, which rely on surface-level similarity and fail to consider informativeness, or simple LLM-based metrics, which are not robust and easily overwhelmed by the long contexts. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called EVA-Score to extract all information from the given summaries, identify overlapped information based on reference, and calculate the information score. We test EVA-Score on several datasets and the experimental results reveal that EVA-Score shows the highest correlation with humans. We also re-evaluate the performance of LLMs on long-form summarization from the information perspective. The results indicate that responses of LLMs still have a gap with the human-written answers. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of EVA-Score, forecasting future ways to automatically evaluate abstractive long-form summarization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Modarressi, Abdullatif K\"oksal, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Many datasets have been developed to train and evaluate document-level relation extraction (RE) models. Most of these are constructed using real-world data. It has been shown that RE models trained on real-world data suffer from factual biases. To evaluate and address this issue, we present CovEReD, a counterfactual data generation approach for document-level relation extraction datasets using entity replacement. We first demonstrate that models trained on factual data exhibit inconsistent behavior: while they accurately extract triples from factual data, they fail to extract the same triples after counterfactual modification. This inconsistency suggests that models trained on factual data rely on spurious signals such as specific entities and external knowledge $\unicode{x2013}$ rather than on the input context $\unicode{x2013}$ to extract triples. We show that by generating document-level counterfactual data with CovEReD and training models on them, consistency is maintained with minimal impact on RE performance. We release our CovEReD pipeline as well as Re-DocRED-CF, a dataset of counterfactual RE documents, to assist in evaluating and addressing inconsistency in document-level RE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-text generation is seemingly ubiquitous in real-world applications of large language models such as generating an email or writing a review. Despite the fundamental importance and prevalence of long-text generation in many practical applications, existing work on personalized generation has focused on the generation of very short text. To overcome these limitations, we study the problem of personalized long-text generation, that is, generating long-text that is personalized for a specific user while being practically useful for the vast majority of real-world applications that naturally require the generation of longer text. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of user-specific personalization for long-text generation tasks and develop the Long-text Language Model Personalization (LongLaMP) Benchmark. LongLaMP provides a comprehensive and diverse evaluation framework for personalized long-text generation. Extensive experiments on LongLaMP for zero-shot and fine-tuned language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark and its utility for developing and evaluating techniques for personalized long-text generation across a wide variety of long-text generation tasks. The results highlight the importance of personalization across a wide variety of long-text generation tasks. Finally, we release the benchmark for others to use for this important problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youmin Ko, Hyemin Yang, Taeuk Kim, Hyunjoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) has recently shown a potential to improve knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, most PLM-based methods focus solely on encoding textual information, neglecting the long-tailed nature of knowledge graphs and their various topological structures, e.g., subgraphs, shortest paths, and degrees. We claim that this is a major obstacle to achieving higher accuracy of PLMs for KGC. To this end, we propose a Subgraph-Aware Training framework for KGC (SATKGC) with two ideas: (i) subgraph-aware mini-batching to encourage hard negative sampling and to mitigate an imbalance in the frequency of entity occurrences during training, and (ii) new contrastive learning to focus more on harder in-batch negative triples and harder positive triples in terms of the structural properties of the knowledge graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively incorporate the structural inductive bias of the knowledge graph into fine-tuning PLMs. Extensive experiments on three KGC benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SATKGC. Our code is available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) technology is constantly improving towards human-like dialogue. Values are a basic driving force underlying human behavior, but little research has been done to study the values exhibited in text generated by LLMs. Here we study this question by turning to the rich literature on value structure in psychology. We ask whether LLMs exhibit the same value structure that has been demonstrated in humans, including the ranking of values, and correlation between values. We show that the results of this analysis depend on how the LLM is prompted, and that under a particular prompting strategy (referred to as "Value Anchoring") the agreement with human data is quite compelling. Our results serve both to improve our understanding of values in LLMs, as well as introduce novel methods for assessing consistency in LLM responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Jiang, Yimin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in visual-language reasoning across diverse cross-modal benchmarks. Despite these advances, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, underachieve compared to well-trained smaller models, such as BERT, in Fake News Detection (FND), prompting inquiries into LVLMs' efficacy in FND tasks. Although performance could improve through fine-tuning LVLMs, the substantial parameters and requisite pre-trained weights render it a resource-heavy endeavor for FND applications. This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model. Next, we integrate standard in-context learning (ICL) with LVLMs, noting improvements in FND performance, though limited in scope and consistency. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (IMFND) framework, enriching in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a well-trained smaller model. This strategic integration directs the LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the IMFND framework significantly boosts the FND efficiency of LVLMs, achieving enhanced accuracy over the standard ICL approach across three publicly available FND datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baixuan Li, Yunlong Fan, Tianyi Ma, Zhiqiang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) do not perform as well when answering questions in non-dominant languages as they do in their dominant languages. Although existing translate-then-answer methods alleviate this issue, the mechanisms behind their effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we analogize the dominant language of MLLMs to the native language of humans and use two human cognitive features: the Language Trigger (LT) and the Domain Trigger (DT), to interpret the mechanisms behind translate-then-answer methods. This reveals that while sufficient LTs are provided by these methods, there remains a deficiency in DT retention. To mitigate this issue, we propose Native Language Prompting (NatLan), employing a Multi-MLLM collaboration strategy and introducing an additional role-enhanced domain-specific MLLM with stronger multilingual understanding capabilities as the translator. Across five language QA benchmarks, NatLan achieves up to a 31.28% improvement in accuracy and, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, provides comparable or greater retention of DTs in up to 87% of cases.

This paper addresses the need for LLMs to recognize and refuse infeasible tasks due to the required skills surpassing their capabilities. We first conceptualize infeasible tasks for LLMs and provide categorizations that cover a spectrum of related hallucinations over existing literature. We develop and benchmark a new dataset comprising diverse infeasible and feasible tasks to evaluate multiple LLMs' abilities to reject infeasible tasks. Furthermore, we explore the potential of increasing LLMs' refusal capabilities with fine-tuning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our trained models, offering promising directions for refining the operational boundaries of LLMs in real applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Gholamian, Gianfranco Romani, Bartosz Rudnikowicz, Stavroula Skylaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benefiting from diverse instruction datasets, contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) perform effectively as AI assistants in collaborating with humans. However, LLMs still struggle to generate natural and colloquial responses in real-world applications such as chatbots and psychological counseling that require more human-like interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce NICO, a Natural Interactive COnversation dataset in Chinese. We first use GPT-4-turbo to generate dialogue drafts and make them cover 20 daily-life topics and 5 types of social interactions. Then, we hire workers to revise these dialogues to ensure that they are free of grammatical errors and unnatural utterances. We define two dialogue-level natural conversation tasks and two sentence-level tasks for identifying and rewriting unnatural sentences. Multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs are tested and analyzed in detail. The experimental results highlight the challenge of the tasks and demonstrate how NICO can help foster the natural dialogue capabilities of LLMs. The dataset will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) have attained high accuracy in detecting LLM-generated text. However, existing methods primarily focus on distinguishing fully watermarked text from non-watermarked text, overlooking real-world scenarios where LLMs generate only small sections within large documents. In this scenario, balancing time complexity and detection performance poses significant challenges. This paper presents WaterSeeker, a novel approach to efficiently detect and locate watermarked segments amid extensive natural text. It first applies an efficient anomaly extraction method to preliminarily locate suspicious watermarked regions. Following this, it conducts a local traversal and performs full-text detection for more precise verification. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WaterSeeker achieves a superior balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, WaterSeeker's localization ability supports the development of interpretable AI detection systems. This work pioneers a new direction in watermarked segment detection, facilitating more reliable AI-generated content identification.Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-BPM/WaterSeeker.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengfei Liang, Archish Arun, Zekun Wu, Cristian Munoz, Jonathan Lutch, Emre Kazim, Adriano Koshiyama, Philip Treleaven</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect content, is a growing challenge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing detection and mitigation methods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lacking a standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for Hallucination Mitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressing this gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test set creation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling, and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect and reduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation and binary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge base of academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial models like GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL. Additionally, PEFT significantly enhances the performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in both evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Tsfasman, Bernd Dudzik, Kristian Fenech, Andras Lorincz, Catholijn M. Jonker, Catharine Oertel</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational memory is the process by which humans encode, retain and retrieve verbal, non-verbal and contextual information from a conversation. Since human memory is selective, differing recollections of the same events can lead to misunderstandings and misalignments within a group. Yet, conversational facilitation systems, aimed at advancing the quality of group interactions, usually focus on tracking users' states within an individual session, ignoring what remains in each participant's memory after the interaction. Understanding conversational memory can be used as a source of information on the long-term development of social connections within a group. This paper introduces the MeMo corpus, the first conversational dataset annotated with participants' memory retention reports, aimed at facilitating computational modelling of human conversational memory. The MeMo corpus includes 31 hours of small-group discussions on Covid-19, repeated 3 times over the term of 2 weeks. It integrates validated behavioural and perceptual measures, audio, video, and multimodal annotations, offering a valuable resource for studying and modelling conversational memory and group dynamics. By introducing the MeMo corpus, analysing its validity, and demonstrating its usefulness for future research, this paper aims to pave the way for future research in conversational memory modelling for intelligent system development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongman Park, Minbeom Kim, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Creative story generation has long been a goal of NLP research. While existing methodologies have aimed to generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and character depth. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two modules for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize a text-to-image model to create visual representations of key story elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and main plots, in a more novel and concrete manner than text-only approaches. The MW module uses these story elements to generate multiple persona-description candidates and selects the best one to insert into the story, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of the narrative. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through statistical analysis, as well as human and LLM evaluations. The results showed that the IG and MW modules significantly improve various aspects of the stories' creativity. Furthermore, our framework enables interactive multi-modal story generation with users, opening up new possibilities for human-LLM integration in cultural development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Ashkinaze, Emily Fry, Narendra Edara, Eric Gilbert, Ceren Budak</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sathya Krishnan Suresh, Wu Mengjun, Tushar Pranav, Eng Siong Chng</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of domain-specific dialogue datasets limits the development of dialogue systems across applications. Existing research is constrained by general or niche datasets that lack sufficient scale for training dialogue systems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue generation framework capable of generating high-quality, contextually rich dialogues across a wide range of domains. Unlike existing frameworks, DiaSynth uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to generate dynamic, domain-specific dialogues with simulated personas and diverse conversational features. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic data using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The pretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base models by 16.47% on dialogue summarization, while the comparison between models fine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data is able to capture 90.48% of the performance distribution of the in-domain data on dialogue summarization. The quality of the data generated also increases as we increase the size of LLM from 3B to 8B. These results validate DiaSynth's potential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods. We open source the code and data generated for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I-Fan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne</p>
<p>Abstract: In this short paper we propose a data augmentation method for intent detection in zero-resource domains. Existing data augmentation methods rely on few labelled examples for each intent category, which can be expensive in settings with many possible intents. We use a two-stage approach: First, we generate utterances for intent labels using an open-source large language model in a zero-shot setting. Second, we develop a smaller sequence-to-sequence model (the Refiner), to improve the generated utterances. The Refiner is fine-tuned on seen domains and then applied to unseen domains. We evaluate our method by training an intent classifier on the generated data, and evaluating it on real (human) data. We find that the Refiner significantly improves the data utility and diversity over the zero-shot LLM baseline for unseen domains and over common baseline approaches. Our results indicate that a two-step approach of a generative LLM in zero-shot setting and a smaller sequence-to-sequence model can provide high-quality data for intent detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Yu, Baolin Peng, Vineeth Vajipey, Hao Cheng, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao, Zhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon planning tasks. To address these limitations, we present Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS) and Exploratory Learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce R-MCTS, a novel test-time algorithm designed to enhance the ability of AI agents to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate to provide reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o-based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' reasoning and planning capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Kramer, Jill Baumann</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose cognitive prompting as a novel approach to guide problem-solving in large language models (LLMs) through structured, human-like cognitive operations such as goal clarification, decomposition, filtering, abstraction, and pattern recognition. By employing systematic, step-by-step reasoning, cognitive prompting enables LLMs to efficiently tackle complex, multi-step tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive prompting on Meta's LLaMA models, comparing performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks using the GSM8K dataset and on commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Our analysis includes comparisons between models without cognitive prompting, models with a static sequence of cognitive operations, and models using reflective cognitive prompting, where the LLM dynamically self-selects the sequence of cognitive operations. The results show that cognitive prompting, particularly when dynamically adapted, significantly improves the performance of larger models, such as LLaMA3.1 70B, and enhances their ability to handle multi-step reasoning tasks. This approach also improves interpretability and flexibility, highlighting cognitive prompting as a promising strategy for general-purpose AI reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacio Hounie, Charilaos Kanatsoulis, Arnuv Tandon, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) method that effectively adapts large pre-trained models for downstream tasks. LoRA parameterizes model updates using low-rank matrices at each layer, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters and, consequently, resource requirements during fine-tuning. However, the lower bound on the number of trainable parameters remains high due to the use of the low-rank matrix model. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a novel approach that employs a low rank tensor parametrization for model updates. The proposed low rank tensor model can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, while also allowing for finer-grained control over adapter size. Our experiments on Natural Language Understanding, Instruction Tuning, Preference Optimization and Protein Folding benchmarks demonstrate that our method is both efficient and effective for fine-tuning large language models, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of parameters while maintaining comparable performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning-based unlearning methods prevail for preventing targeted harmful, sensitive, or copyrighted information within large language models while preserving overall capabilities. However, the true effectiveness of these methods is unclear. In this work, we delve into the limitations of fine-tuning-based unlearning through activation patching and parameter restoration experiments. Our findings reveal that these methods alter the model's knowledge retrieval process, providing further evidence that they do not genuinely erase the problematic knowledge embedded in the model parameters. Instead, the coefficients generated by the MLP components in the model's final layer are the primary contributors to these seemingly positive unlearning effects, playing a crucial role in controlling the model's behaviors. Furthermore, behavioral tests demonstrate that this unlearning mechanism inevitably impacts the global behavior of the models, affecting unrelated knowledge or capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxin Chen, Zhong Zhang, Xin Cong, Fangda Guo, Yesai Wu, Yankai Lin, Wenzheng Feng, Yasheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool learning enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly expanding the application scope of LLMs. However, due to the dynamic nature of external environments, these tools and APIs may become outdated over time, preventing LLMs from correctly invoking tools. Existing research primarily focuses on static environments and overlooks this issue, limiting the adaptability of LLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ToolEVO, a novel framework designed to enhance the adaptive and reflective capabilities of LLMs against tool variability. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, ToolEVO facilitates active exploration and interaction of LLMs within dynamic environments, allowing for autonomous self-reflection and self-updating of tool usage based on environmental feedback. Additionally, we introduce ToolQA-D, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of tool variability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach, highlighting the importance of adaptability to tool variability for effective tool learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Qi, Zhiyang Xu, Rulin Shao, Yang Chen, Jin Di, Yu Cheng, Qifan Wang, Lifu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) still exhibit inferior performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, primarily due to the challenge of accurately encoding all the associations between visual objects and scenes to their corresponding entities and background knowledge. While retrieval augmentation methods offer an efficient way to integrate external knowledge, extending them to vision-language domain presents unique challenges in (1) precisely retrieving relevant information from external sources due to the inherent discrepancy within the multimodal queries, and (2) being resilient to the irrelevant, extraneous and noisy information contained in the retrieved multimodal knowledge snippets. In this work, we introduce RORA-VLM, a novel and robust retrieval augmentation framework specifically tailored for VLMs, with two key innovations: (1) a 2-stage retrieval process with image-anchored textual-query expansion to synergistically combine the visual and textual information in the query and retrieve the most relevant multimodal knowledge snippets; and (2) a robust retrieval augmentation method that strengthens the resilience of VLMs against irrelevant information in the retrieved multimodal knowledge by injecting adversarial noises into the retrieval-augmented training process, and filters out extraneous visual information, such as unrelated entities presented in images, via a query-oriented visual token refinement strategy. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods on three widely adopted benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that with a minimal amount of training instance, RORA-VLM enables the base model to achieve significant performance improvement and constantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented VLMs on all benchmarks while also exhibiting a novel zero-shot domain transfer capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Moussa, Dietrich Klakow, Mariya Toneva</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech language models align with human brain responses to natural language to an impressive degree. However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Fei, Yasaman Razeghi, Sameer Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require alignment, such as instruction-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training aligned versions for every model size in each model family, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose nudging, a simple, plug-and-play, and training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. Nudging is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens, such as "Sure" or "Thank". We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Leveraging this observation, nudging employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to steer the large base model's output toward desired directions when the base model's uncertainty is high. We evaluate the effectiveness of nudging across 3 model families and 13 tasks, covering reasoning, general knowledge, instruction following, and safety benchmarks. Without any additional training, nudging a large base model with a 7x - 14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. For example, nudging OLMo-7b with OLMo-1b-instruct, affecting less than 9% of tokens, achieves a 10% absolute improvement on GSM8K over OLMo-7b-instruct. Unlike prior inference-time tuning methods, nudging enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-2-7b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, this work introduces a simple yet powerful approach to token-level model collaboration, offering a modular solution to LLM alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saadia Gabriel, Liang Lyu, James Siderius, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Jacob Andreas, Asu Ozdaglar</p>
<p>Abstract: The spread of misinformation on social media platforms threatens democratic processes, contributes to massive economic losses, and endangers public health. Many efforts to address misinformation focus on a knowledge deficit model and propose interventions for improving users' critical thinking through access to facts. Such efforts are often hampered by challenges with scalability, and by platform users' personal biases. The emergence of generative AI presents promising opportunities for countering misinformation at scale across ideological barriers.
  In this paper, we introduce a framework (MisinfoEval) for generating and comprehensively evaluating large language model (LLM) based misinformation interventions. We present (1) an experiment with a simulated social media environment to measure effectiveness of misinformation interventions, and (2) a second experiment with personalized explanations tailored to the demographics and beliefs of users with the goal of countering misinformation by appealing to their pre-existing values. Our findings confirm that LLM-based interventions are highly effective at correcting user behavior (improving overall user accuracy at reliability labeling by up to 41.72%). Furthermore, we find that users favor more personalized interventions when making decisions about news reliability and users shown personalized interventions have significantly higher accuracy at identifying misinformation.</p>

We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, are numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the selection strategy for rows and columns as well as the optimal rank for effective implementation of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingda Chen, Xingjun Wang, Jintao Huang, Yunlin Mao, Daoze Zhang, Yuze Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models rapidly evolve to support longer context, there is a notable disparity in their capability to generate output at greater lengths. Recent study suggests that the primary cause for this imbalance may arise from the lack of data with long-output during alignment training. In light of this observation, attempts are made to re-align foundation models with data that fills the gap, which result in models capable of generating lengthy output when instructed. In this paper, we explore the impact of data-quality in tuning a model for long output, and the possibility of doing so from the starting points of human-aligned (instruct or chat) models. With careful data curation, we show that it possible to achieve similar performance improvement in our tuned models, with only a small fraction of training data instances and compute. In addition, we assess the generalizability of such approaches by applying our tuning-recipes to several models. our findings suggest that, while capacities for generating long output vary across different models out-of-the-box, our approach to tune them with high-quality data using lite compute, consistently yields notable improvement across all models we experimented on. We have made public our curated dataset for tuning long-writing capability, the implementations of model tuning and evaluation, as well as the fine-tuned models, all of which can be openly-accessed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangchi Feng, Dongdong Kuang, Zhongyuan Wang, Zhijie Nie, Yaowei Zheng, Richong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents EasyRAG, a simple, lightweight, and efficient retrieval-augmented generation framework for automated network operations. Our framework has three advantages. The first is accurate question answering. We designed a straightforward RAG scheme based on (1) a specific data processing workflow (2) dual-route sparse retrieval for coarse ranking (3) LLM Reranker for reranking (4) LLM answer generation and optimization. This approach achieved first place in the GLM4 track in the preliminary round and second place in the GLM4 track in the semifinals. The second is simple deployment. Our method primarily consists of BM25 retrieval and BGE-reranker reranking, requiring no fine-tuning of any models, occupying minimal VRAM, easy to deploy, and highly scalable; we provide a flexible code library with various search and generation strategies, facilitating custom process implementation. The last one is efficient inference. We designed an efficient inference acceleration scheme for the entire coarse ranking, reranking, and generation process that significantly reduces the inference latency of RAG while maintaining a good level of accuracy; each acceleration scheme can be plug-and-play into any component of the RAG process, consistently enhancing the efficiency of the RAG system. Our code and data are released at \url{https://github.com/BUAADreamer/EasyRAG}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongtian Yue, Longteng Guo, Jie Cheng, Xuange Gao, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer a promising approach to managing computational costs while scaling up model parameters. Conventional MoE-based LLMs typically employ static Top-K routing, which activates a fixed and equal number of experts for each token regardless of their significance within the context. In this paper, we propose a novel Ada-K routing strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of activated experts for each token, thereby improving the balance between computational efficiency and model performance. Specifically, our strategy incorporates learnable and lightweight allocator modules that decide customized expert resource allocation tailored to the contextual needs for each token. These allocators are designed to be fully pluggable, making it broadly applicable across all mainstream MoE-based LLMs. We leverage the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to facilitate an end-to-end learning process for this non-differentiable decision-making framework. Extensive evaluations on four popular baseline models demonstrate that our Ada-K routing method significantly outperforms conventional Top-K routing. Compared to Top-K, our method achieves over 25% reduction in FLOPs and more than 20% inference speedup while still improving performance across various benchmarks. Moreover, the training of Ada-K is highly efficient. Even for Mixtral-8x22B, a MoE-based LLM with more than 140B parameters, the training time is limited to 8 hours. Detailed analysis shows that harder tasks, middle layers, and content words tend to activate more experts, providing valuable insights for future adaptive MoE system designs. Both the training code and model checkpoints will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houjiang Liu, Anubrata Das, Alexander Boltz, Didi Zhou, Daisy Pinaroc, Matthew Lease, Min Kyung Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: While many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been proposed for fact-checking, both academic research and fact-checking organizations report limited adoption of such NLP work due to poor alignment with fact-checker practices, values, and needs. To address this, we investigate a co-design method, Matchmaking for AI, to enable fact-checkers, designers, and NLP researchers to collaboratively identify what fact-checker needs should be addressed by technology, and to brainstorm ideas for potential solutions. Co-design sessions we conducted with 22 professional fact-checkers yielded a set of 11 design ideas that offer a "north star", integrating fact-checker criteria into novel NLP design concepts. These concepts range from pre-bunking misinformation, efficient and personalized monitoring misinformation, proactively reducing fact-checker potential biases, and collaborative writing fact-check reports. Our work provides new insights into both human-centered fact-checking research and practice and AI co-design research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyan Zhao, John Dang, Aditya Grover</p>
<p>Abstract: Many applications of large language models (LLMs), ranging from chatbots to creative writing, require nuanced subjective judgments that can differ significantly across different groups. Existing alignment algorithms can be expensive to align for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of group-specific preference data and computation for real-world use cases. We introduce Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an alignment framework that steers language models to preferences of individual groups in a few-shot manner. In GPO, we augment the base LLM with an independent transformer module trained to predict the preferences of a group for the LLM generations. For few-shot learning, we parameterize this module as an in-context autoregressive transformer and train it via meta-learning on several groups. We empirically validate the efficacy of GPO through rigorous evaluations using LLMs with varied sizes on three human opinion adaptation tasks. These tasks involve adapting to the preferences of US demographic groups, global countries, and individual users. Our results demonstrate that GPO not only aligns models more accurately but also requires fewer group-specific preferences, and less training and inference computing resources, outperforming existing strategies such as in-context steering and fine-tuning methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have immense potential to make information more accessible, particularly in medicine, where complex medical jargon can hinder patient comprehension of clinical notes. We developed a patient-facing tool using LLMs to make clinical notes more readable by simplifying, extracting information from, and adding context to the notes. We piloted the tool with clinical notes donated by patients with a history of breast cancer and synthetic notes from a clinician. Participants (N=200, healthy, female-identifying patients) were randomly assigned three clinical notes in our tool with varying levels of augmentations and answered quantitative and qualitative questions evaluating their understanding of follow-up actions. Augmentations significantly increased their quantitative understanding scores. In-depth interviews were conducted with participants (N=7, patients with a history of breast cancer), revealing both positive sentiments about the augmentations and concerns about AI. We also performed a qualitative clinician-driven analysis of the model's error modes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangkai Jiao, Chengwei Qin, Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen, Shafiq Joty</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Yunxuan Li, Yuexin Wu, Liangchen Luo, Le Hou, Hongkun Yu, Jingbo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Process supervision, using a trained verifier to evaluate the intermediate steps generated by a reasoner, has demonstrated significant improvements in multi-step problem solving. In this paper, to avoid the expensive effort of human annotation on the verifier training data, we introduce Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS), a novel method for automating data curation. MiPS annotates an intermediate step by sampling completions of this solution through the reasoning model, and obtaining an accuracy defined as the proportion of correct completions. Inaccuracies of the reasoner would cause MiPS underestimating the accuracy of intermediate steps, therefore, we suggest and empirically show that verification focusing on high predicted scores of the verifier shall be preferred over that of low predicted scores, contrary to prior observations on human curated data. Our approach significantly improves the performance of PaLM 2 on math and coding tasks (accuracy +0.67% on GSM8K, +4.16% on MATH, +0.92% on MBPP compared with an output supervision trained verifier). Additionally, our study demonstrates that the verifier exhibits strong generalization ability across different reasoning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Ge, Zhijian Ma, Daoyuan Chen, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, primarily attributed to the utilization of diversely sourced data. However, the impact of pretraining data composition on model performance remains poorly understood. This paper introduces $\textbf{BiMix}$, a novel bivariate data mixing law that models the joint scaling behavior of domain proportions and data volume in LLM pretraining. $\textbf{BiMix}$ provides a systematic framework for understanding and optimizing data mixtures across diverse domains. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we demonstrate $\textbf{BiMix}$'s high accuracy in loss extrapolation (mean relative error < 0.2%) and its generalization to unseen mixtures (R${}^{2}$ > 0.97). Optimization of domain proportions yields superior model performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we establish entropy-based measures as efficient proxies for data mixing, offering a computationally lightweight strategy. Our work contributes both theoretical insights into data mixing dynamics and practical tools for enhancing LLM training efficiency, paving the way for more effective scaling strategies in language model development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Huang, Jianbo Dai, Han Weng, Puzhen Wu, Yuhao Qing, Heming Cui, Zhijiang Guo, Jie M. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in code generation, but their generated code often suffers from inefficiency, resulting in longer execution times and higher memory consumption. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{EffiLearner}, a self-optimization framework that utilizes execution overhead profiles to improve the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiLearner first generates code using an LLM, then executes it locally to capture execution time and memory usage profiles. These profiles are fed back to the LLM, which then revises the code to reduce overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness of EffiLearner, we conduct extensive experiments on the EffiBench, HumanEval, and MBPP with 16 open-source and 6 closed-source models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that through iterative self-optimization, EffiLearner significantly enhances the efficiency of LLM-generated code. For example, the execution time (ET) of StarCoder2-15B for the EffiBench decreases from 0.93 (s) to 0.12 (s) which reduces 87.1% the execution time requirement compared with the initial code. The total memory usage (TMU) of StarCoder2-15B also decreases from 22.02 (Mb*s) to 2.03 (Mb*s), which decreases 90.8% of total memory consumption during the execution process. The source code of EffiLearner was released in \url{https://github.com/huangd1999/EffiLearner}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have consistently struggled with complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving. Investigating the internal reasoning mechanisms of these models can help us design better model architectures and training strategies, ultimately enhancing their reasoning capability. In this study, we constructed a symbolic dataset to investigate the mechanisms by which Transformer models employ vertical thinking strategy based on their inherent structure and horizontal thinking strategy based on Chain of Thought to achieve multi-step reasoning. We introduced the concept of buffer mechanism: the model stores various information in distinct buffers and selectively extracts them through the query-key matrix. We proposed a random matrix-based algorithm to enhance the model's reasoning ability, resulting in a 75% reduction in the training time required for the GPT-2 model to achieve generalization capability on the PrOntoQA dataset. These findings provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms of large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), by anchoring, adapting, and personalizing their responses to the most relevant knowledge sources. It is particularly useful in chatbot applications, allowing developers to customize LLM output without expensive retraining. Despite their significant utility in various applications, RAG systems present new security risks. In this work, we propose new attack vectors that allow an adversary to inject a single malicious document into a RAG system's knowledge base, and mount a backdoor poisoning attack. We design Phantom, a general two-stage optimization framework against RAG systems, that crafts a malicious poisoned document leading to an integrity violation in the model's output. First, the document is constructed to be retrieved only when a specific trigger sequence of tokens appears in the victim's queries. Second, the document is further optimized with crafted adversarial text that induces various adversarial objectives on the LLM output, including refusal to answer, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors. We demonstrate our attacks on multiple LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama, and show that they transfer to GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Finally, we successfully conducted a Phantom attack on NVIDIA's black-box production RAG system, "Chat with RTX".</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have unlocked new prospects in autonomous driving, yet the experimental settings of these studies are preliminary, over-simplified, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world driving scenarios in human environments. It remains under-explored whether FM agents can handle long-horizon navigation tasks with free-from dialogue and deal with unexpected situations caused by environmental dynamics or task changes. To explore the capabilities and boundaries of FMs faced with the challenges above, we introduce DriVLMe, a video-language-model-based agent to facilitate natural and effective communication between humans and autonomous vehicles that perceive the environment and navigate. We develop DriVLMe from both embodied experiences in a simulated environment and social experiences from real human dialogue. While DriVLMe demonstrates competitive performance in both open-loop benchmarks and closed-loop human studies, we reveal several limitations and challenges, including unacceptable inference time, imbalanced training data, limited visual understanding, challenges with multi-turn interactions, simplified language generation from robotic experiences, and difficulties in handling on-the-fly unexpected situations like environmental dynamics and task changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities from few-shot demonstration exemplars. While recent learning-based demonstration selection methods have proven beneficial to ICL by choosing more useful exemplars, their underlying mechanisms are opaque, hindering efforts to address limitations such as high training costs and poor generalization across tasks. These methods generally assume the selection process captures similarities between the exemplar and the target instance, however, it remains unknown what kinds of similarities are captured and vital to performing ICL. To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanisms of the learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two important factors related to similarity measurement: 1) The ability to integrate different levels of task-agnostic text similarities between the input of exemplars and test cases enhances generalization power across different tasks. 2) Incorporating task-specific labels when measuring the similarities significantly improves the performance on each specific task. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses across ten datasets and various LLMs. Based on our findings, we introduce two effective yet simplified exemplar selection methods catering to task-agnostic and task-specific demands, eliminating the costly LLM inference overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has outpaced the development of model evaluation, highlighting the need for continuous curation of new, challenging benchmarks. However, manual curation of high-quality, human-aligned benchmarks is expensive and time-consuming. To address this, we introduce BenchBuilder, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs to curate high-quality, open-ended prompts from large, crowd-sourced datasets, enabling continuous benchmark updates without human in the loop. We apply BenchBuilder to datasets such as Chatbot Arena and WildChat-1M, extracting challenging prompts and utilizing LLM-as-a-Judge for automatic model evaluation. To validate benchmark quality, we propose new metrics to measure a benchmark's alignment with human preferences and ability to separate models. We release Arena-Hard-Auto, a benchmark consisting 500 challenging prompts curated by BenchBuilder. Arena-Hard-Auto provides 3x higher separation of model performances compared to MT-Bench and achieves 98.6% correlation with human preference rankings, all at a cost of $20. Our work sets a new framework for the scalable curation of automated benchmarks from extensive data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Ni, Tobias Schimanski, Meihong Lin, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanzeng Xia, Hao Liu, Yisong Yue, Tongxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context decision-making is an important capability of artificial general intelligence, which Large Language Models (LLMs) have effectively demonstrated in various scenarios. However, LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper is the first to investigate the performance of LLMs as decision-makers in the context of Dueling Bandits (DB). We compare GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-preview against eight well-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo, quickly identify the Condorcet winner, thus outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of weak regret. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to converge even when explicitly prompted to do so and are sensitive to prompt variations. To overcome these issues, we introduce a hybrid algorithm: LLM-Enhanced Adaptive Dueling (LEAD), which takes advantage of both in-context decision-making capabilities of LLMs and theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees on both weak and strong regret and validate its robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of such an algorithm sheds light on how to enhance trustworthiness for LLMs used in decision-making tasks where performance robustness matters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in real-world settings, yet their strategic decision-making abilities remain largely unexplored. To fully benefit from the potential of LLMs, it's essential to understand their ability to function in complex social scenarios. Game theory, which is already used to understand real-world interactions, provides a good framework for assessing these abilities. This work investigates the performance and merits of LLMs in canonical game-theoretic two-player non-zero-sum games, Stag Hunt and Prisoner Dilemma. Our structured evaluation of GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B shows that these models, when making decisions in these games, are affected by at least one of the following systematic biases: positional bias, payoff bias, or behavioural bias. This indicates that LLMs do not fully rely on logical reasoning when making these strategic decisions. As a result, it was found that the LLMs' performance drops when the game configuration is misaligned with the affecting biases. When misaligned, GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B show an average performance drop of 32\%, 25\%, 34\%, and 29\% respectively in Stag Hunt, and 28\%, 16\%, 34\%, and 24\% respectively in Prisoner's Dilemma. Surprisingly, GPT-4o (a top-performing LLM across standard benchmarks) suffers the most substantial performance drop, suggesting that newer models are not addressing these issues. Interestingly, we found that a commonly used method of improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, reduces the biases in GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B but increases the effect of the bias in GPT-4-Turbo, indicating that CoT alone cannot fully serve as a robust solution to this problem. We perform several additional experiments, which provide further insight into these observed behaviours.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Sun, Haochen Shi, Marc-Alexandre C\^ot\'e, Glen Berseth, Xingdi Yuan, Bang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, with their impressive performance largely attributed to the extensive domain knowledge embedded within them. However, the depth and breadth of this knowledge can vary across domains. Many existing approaches assume that LLMs possess a comprehensive understanding of their environment, often overlooking potential gaps in their grasp of actual world dynamics. To address this, we introduce Discover, Verify, and Evolve (DiVE), a framework that discovers world dynamics from a small number of demonstrations, verifies the accuracy of these dynamics, and evolves new, advanced dynamics tailored to the current situation. Through extensive evaluations, we assess the impact of each component on performance and compare the dynamics generated by DiVE to human-annotated dynamics. Our results show that LLMs guided by DiVE make more informed decisions, achieving rewards comparable to human players in the Crafter environment and surpassing methods that require prior task-specific training in the MiniHack environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbo Wang, Jian Liang, Ran He, Zilei Wang, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation, also known as LoRA, has emerged as a prominent method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. Despite its computational efficiency, LoRA still yields inferior performance compared to full fine-tuning. In this paper, we first uncover a fundamental connection between the optimization processes of LoRA and full fine-tuning: using LoRA for optimization is mathematically equivalent to full fine-tuning using a low-rank gradient for parameter updates. And this low-rank gradient can be expressed in terms of the gradients of the two low-rank matrices in LoRA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a method that enhances LoRA's performance by strategically adjusting the gradients of these low-rank matrices. This adjustment allows the low-rank gradient to more accurately approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, thereby narrowing the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the optimal solutions for adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices, applying them during fine-tuning in LoRA-Pro. We conduct extensive experiments across natural language understanding, dialogue generation, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and image classification tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-Pro substantially improves LoRA's performance, effectively narrowing the gap with full fine-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyuk Lim, Bruce W. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines a phenomenon in multimodal language models where pre-marked options in question images can significantly influence model responses. Our study employs a systematic methodology to investigate this effect: we present models with images of multiple-choice questions, which they initially answer correctly, then expose the same model to versions with pre-marked options. Our findings reveal a significant shift in the models' responses towards the pre-marked option, even when it contradicts their answers in the neutral settings. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this agreeableness bias is a consistent and quantifiable behavior across various model architectures. These results show potential limitations in the reliability of these models when processing images with pre-marked options, raising important questions about their application in critical decision-making contexts where such visual cues might be present.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism in popular transformer architectures poses significant challenges for training and inference, and becomes the bottleneck for long inputs. Is it possible to significantly reduce the quadratic time complexity of computing the gradients in multi-layer transformer models? This paper proves that a novel fast approximation method can calculate the gradients in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the input sequence length, while it maintains a polynomially small approximation error $1 / \mathrm{poly}(n)$ across the entire model. Our theory holds for general loss functions and when the multi-layer transformer model contains many practical sub-modules, such as residual connection, casual mask, and multi-head attention. By improving the efficiency of gradient computation, we hope that this work will facilitate more effective training and deployment of long-context language models based on our theoretical results.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02024">FLAG: Financial Long Document Classification via AMR-based GNN</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bolun "Namir" Xia, Mohammed J. Zaki, Aparna Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has initiated much research into their various financial applications. However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index. We find that our AMR-based approach outperforms fine-tuning LLMs directly on text in predicting stock price movement trends at different time horizons in both datasets. Our work also outperforms previous work utilizing document graphs and GNNs for text classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ulyana Piterbarg, Lerrel Pinto, Rob Fergus</p>
<p>Abstract: Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks. We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines. This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score. Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding. We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class. Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05584">Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation: Are We Barking up the Wrong Tree?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xing Yu, Xinyu Lu, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of Regressional Goodhart's effect, we identify the existence of exogenous variables impacting the relationship between RM quality measured by accuracy and policy model capability. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09437">MTL-LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation for Multi-Task Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaming Yang, Dilxat Muhtar, Yelong Shen, Yuefeng Zhan, Jianfeng Liu, Yujing Wang, Hao Sun, Denvy Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang, Weizhu Chen, Yunhai Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has been widely employed for domain adaptation, with LoRA being one of the most prominent methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, in multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, LoRA tends to obscure the distinction between tasks by projecting sparse high-dimensional features from different tasks into the same dense low-dimensional intrinsic space. This leads to task interference and suboptimal performance for LoRA and its variants. To tackle this challenge, we propose MTL-LoRA, which retains the advantages of low-rank adaptation while significantly enhancing multi-task learning capabilities. MTL-LoRA augments LoRA by incorporating additional task-adaptive parameters that differentiate task-specific information and effectively capture shared knowledge across various tasks within low-dimensional spaces. This approach enables large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on general corpus to adapt to different target task domains with a limited number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experimental results, including evaluations on public academic benchmarks for natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and image-text understanding, as well as real-world industrial text Ads relevance datasets, demonstrate that MTL-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its various variants with comparable or even fewer learnable parameters in multitask learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vithursan Thangarasa, Ganesh Venkatesh, Nish Sinnadurai, Sean Lie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language processing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory resources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we propose self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning 6 decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.30%. Furthermore, our approach scales effectively across datasets, with the quality improving as the dataset size increases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding fine-grained temporal dynamics is crucial for multimodal video comprehension and generation. Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities. Both dataset and evaluation code will be made available.</p>
