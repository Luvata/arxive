<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun R. Malghan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in the healthcare sector, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, their proficiency in numerical reasoning, particularly in high-stakes domains like in clinical applications, remains underexplored. Numerical reasoning is critical in healthcare applications, influencing patient outcomes, treatment planning, and resource allocation. This study investigates the computational accuracy of LLMs in numerical reasoning tasks within healthcare contexts. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 numerical problems, encompassing real-world scenarios such as dosage calculations and lab result interpretations, the performance of a refined LLM based on the GPT-3 architecture was evaluated. The methodology includes prompt engineering, integration of fact-checking pipelines, and application of regularization techniques to enhance model accuracy and generalization. Key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were utilized to assess the model's efficacy. The results indicate an overall accuracy of 84.10%, with improved performance in straightforward numerical tasks and challenges in multi-step reasoning. The integration of a fact-checking pipeline improved accuracy by 11%, underscoring the importance of validation mechanisms. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in healthcare numerical reasoning and identifies avenues for further refinement to support critical decision-making in clinical environments. The findings aim to contribute to the development of reliable, interpretable, and contextually relevant AI tools for healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihua Duan, Jialin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large models in the field of artificial intelligence, how to enhance their application capabilities in handling complex problems in the field of scientific research remains a challenging problem to be solved. This study proposes an improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method based on prompt words. In the simulation search stage, it introduces dynamic adjustment of exploration parameters and adaptive selection strategies, which can better balance exploration and exploitation, thereby reducing the hallucination phenomenon. This paper takes the four subsets of the SciEval dataset as the test objects, and compares the Glm-4-flash+Improved MCTS method with the methods of several existing models. The results show that the Improved MCTS method performs better, providing new ideas and methods for the application of large models in the field of scientific research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina L. Corvelo Benz, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Whenever an AI model is used to predict a relevant (binary) outcome in AI-assisted decision making, it is widely agreed that, together with each prediction, the model should provide an AI confidence value. However, it has been unclear why decision makers have often difficulties to develop a good sense on when to trust a prediction using AI confidence values. Very recently, Corvelo Benz and Gomez Rodriguez have argued that, for rational decision makers, the utility of AI-assisted decision making is inherently bounded by the degree of alignment between the AI confidence values and the decision maker's confidence on their own predictions. In this work, we empirically investigate to what extent the degree of alignment actually influences the utility of AI-assisted decision making. To this end, we design and run a large-scale human subject study (n=703) where participants solve a simple decision making task - an online card game - assisted by an AI model with a steerable degree of alignment. Our results show a positive association between the degree of alignment and the utility of AI-assisted decision making. In addition, our results also show that post-processing the AI confidence values to achieve multicalibration with respect to the participants' confidence on their own predictions increases both the degree of alignment and the utility of AI-assisted decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saaduddin Mahmud, Dorian Benhamou Goldfajn, Shlomo Zilberstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) offer a powerful framework for multi-agent coordination but often rely on labor-intensive, manual problem construction. To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph databases (GDBs) like Neo4j and TigerGraph excel at handling interconnected data but lack advanced inference capabilities. Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) address this by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predictive analysis and reasoning over incomplete or noisy data. However, NGDBs rely on predefined queries and lack autonomy and adaptability. This paper introduces Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which extend NGDBs with three core functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. We identify ten key challenges in realizing Agentic NGDBs: semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and integration with foundation models like large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, Agentic NGDBs can enable intelligent, self-improving systems for modern data-driven applications, paving the way for adaptable and autonomous data management solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xujian Liang, Zhaoquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG) is a novel paradigm that takes the naive RAG system a step further by integrating graph information, such as knowledge graph (KGs), into large-scale language models (LLMs) to mitigate hallucination. However, existing GRAG still encounter limitations: 1) simple paradigms usually fail with the complex problems due to the narrow and shallow correlations capture from KGs 2) methods of strong coupling with KGs tend to be high computation cost and time consuming if the graph is dense. In this paper, we propose the Fast Think-on-Graph (FastToG), an innovative paradigm for enabling LLMs to think ``community by community" within KGs. To do this, FastToG employs community detection for deeper correlation capture and two stages community pruning - coarse and fine pruning for faster retrieval. Furthermore, we also develop two Community-to-Text methods to convert the graph structure of communities into textual form for better understanding by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FastToG, showcasing higher accuracy, faster reasoning, and better explainability compared to the previous works.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14304">MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingzheng Gan, Yufan Zhao, Tianyi Zhang, Jing Huang, Yusu Li, Shu Xian Teo, Changwang Zhang, Wei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, leading to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot obtain an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14334">Exploring the sustainable scaling of AI dilemma: A projective study of corporations&#x27; AI environmental impacts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'ement Desroches, Martin Chauvin, Louis Ladan, Caroline Vateau, Simon Gosset, Philippe Cordier</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised concerns regarding its global environmental impact that extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions to include consideration of hardware fabrication and end-of-life processes. The opacity from major providers hinders companies' abilities to evaluate their AI-related environmental impacts and achieve net-zero targets.In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the environmental impact of a company's AI portfolio, providing actionable insights without necessitating extensive AI and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise. Results confirm that large generative AI models consume up to 4600x more energy than traditional models. Our modelling approach, which accounts for increased AI usage, hardware computing efficiency, and changes in electricity mix in line with IPCC scenarios, forecasts AI electricity use up to 2030. Under a high adoption scenario, driven by widespread Generative AI and agents adoption associated to increasingly complex models and frameworks, AI electricity use is projected to rise by a factor of 24.4.Mitigating the environmental impact of Generative AI by 2030 requires coordinated efforts across the AI value chain. Isolated measures in hardware efficiency, model efficiency, or grid improvements alone are insufficient. We advocate for standardized environmental assessment frameworks, greater transparency from the all actors of the value chain and the introduction of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with net-zero goals.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14360">In System Alignments we Trust! Explainable Alignments via Projections</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominique Sommers, Natalia Sidorova, Boudewijn van Dongen</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignments are a well-known process mining technique for reconciling system logs and normative process models. Evidence of certain behaviors in a real system may only be present in one representation - either a log or a model - but not in the other. Since for processes in which multiple entities, like objects and resources, are involved in the activities, their interactions affect the behavior and are therefore essential to take into account in the alignments.
  Additionally, both logged and modeled representations of reality may be imprecise and only partially represent some of these entities, but not all. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "relaxations" through projections for alignments to deal with partially correct models and logs. Relaxed alignments help to distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy content of the two representations (the log and the model) to achieve a better understanding of the underlying process and expose quality issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Callewaert, Simon Vandevelde, Joost Vennekens</p>
<p>Abstract: A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thore Gerlach, Loong Kuan Lee, Fr\'ed\'eric Barbaresco, Nico Piatkowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on determining conflict-free paths for multiple agents navigating through a shared space to reach specified goal locations. This problem becomes computationally challenging, particularly when handling large numbers of agents, as frequently encountered in practical applications like coordinating autonomous vehicles. Quantum computing (QC) is a promising candidate in overcoming such limits. However, current quantum hardware is still in its infancy and thus limited in terms of computing power and error robustness. In this work, we present the first optimal hybrid quantum-classical MAPF algorithm which is based on branch-and-cut-and-prize. QC is integrated by iteratively solving QUBO problems, based on conflict graphs. Experiments on actual quantum hardware and results on benchmark data suggest that our approach dominates previous QUBO formulations and baseline MAPF solvers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Local search preprocessing makes Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers faster by providing high-quality starting points and modern SAT solvers have incorporated this technique into their preprocessing steps. However, these tools rely on basic strategies that miss the structural patterns in problems. We present a method that applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code. This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT. Our method automatically generates specialized local search algorithms that find these patterns and use them to create strong initial assignments. This works for any problem instance from the same encoding type. Our tests show encouraging results, achieving faster solving times compared to baseline preprocessing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renato Ghisellini, Remo Pareschi, Marco Pedroni, Giovanni Battista Raggi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for recommending actionable strategies by integrating strategic frameworks with decision heuristics through semantic analysis. While strategy frameworks provide systematic models for assessment and planning, and decision heuristics encode experiential knowledge,these traditions have historically remained separate. Our methodology bridges this gap using advanced natural language processing (NLP), demonstrated through integrating frameworks like the 6C model with the Thirty-Six Stratagems. The approach employs vector space representations and semantic similarity calculations to map framework parameters to heuristic patterns, supported by a computational architecture that combines deep semantic processing with constrained use of Large Language Models. By processing both primary content and secondary elements (diagrams, matrices) as complementary linguistic representations, we demonstrate effectiveness through corporate strategy case studies. The methodology generalizes to various analytical frameworks and heuristic sets, culminating in a plug-and-play architecture for generating recommender systems that enable cohesive integration of strategic frameworks and decision heuristics into actionable guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Block, Ayush Sekhari, Alexander Rakhlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in natural language processing tasks, but their ability to generate human-quality text raises significant ethical and operational concerns in settings where it is important to recognize whether or not a given text was generated by a human. Thus, recent work has focused on developing techniques for watermarking LLM-generated text, i.e., introducing an almost imperceptible signal that allows a provider equipped with a secret key to determine if given text was generated by their model. Current watermarking techniques are often not practical due to concerns with generation latency, detection time, degradation in text quality, or robustness. Many of these drawbacks come from the focus on token-level watermarking, which ignores the inherent structure of text. In this work, we introduce a new scheme, GaussMark, that is simple and efficient to implement, has formal statistical guarantees on its efficacy, comes at no cost in generation latency, and embeds the watermark into the weights of the model itself, providing a structural watermark. Our approach is based on Gaussian independence testing and is motivated by recent empirical observations that minor additive corruptions to LLM weights can result in models of identical (or even improved) quality. We show that by adding a small amount of Gaussian noise to the weights of a given LLM, we can watermark the model in a way that is statistically detectable by a provider who retains the secret key. We provide formal statistical bounds on the validity and power of our procedure. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we demonstrate that GaussMark is reliable, efficient, and relatively robust to corruptions such as insertions, deletions, substitutions, and roundtrip translations and can be instantiated with essentially no loss in model quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Liu, Zihan Zhou, Yuanhao Liu, Jing Zhang, Hong Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis aims to infer students' mastery levels based on their historical response logs. However, existing cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs), which rely on ID embeddings, often have to train specific models on specific domains. This limitation may hinder their directly practical application in various target domains, such as different subjects (e.g., Math, English and Physics) or different education platforms (e.g., ASSISTments, Junyi Academy and Khan Academy). To address this issue, this paper proposes the language representation favored zero-shot cross-domain cognitive diagnosis (LRCD). Specifically, LRCD first analyzes the behavior patterns of students, exercises and concepts in different domains, and then describes the profiles of students, exercises and concepts using textual descriptions. Via recent advanced text-embedding modules, these profiles can be transformed to vectors in the unified language space. Moreover, to address the discrepancy between the language space and the cognitive diagnosis space, we propose language-cognitive mappers in LRCD to learn the mapping from the former to the latter. Then, these profiles can be easily and efficiently integrated and trained with existing CDMs. Extensive experiments show that training LRCD on real-world datasets can achieve commendable zero-shot performance across different target domains, and in some cases, it can even achieve competitive performance with some classic CDMs trained on the full response data on target domains. Notably, we surprisingly find that LRCD can also provide interesting insights into the differences between various subjects (such as humanities and sciences) and sources (such as primary and secondary education).</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Fanar, a platform for Arabic-centric multimodal generative AI systems, that supports language, speech and image generation tasks. At the heart of Fanar are Fanar Star and Fanar Prime, two highly capable Arabic Large Language Models (LLMs) that are best in the class on well established benchmarks for similar sized models. Fanar Star is a 7B (billion) parameter model that was trained from scratch on nearly 1 trillion clean and deduplicated Arabic, English and Code tokens. Fanar Prime is a 9B parameter model continually trained on the Gemma-2 9B base model on the same 1 trillion token set. Both models are concurrently deployed and designed to address different types of prompts transparently routed through a custom-built orchestrator. The Fanar platform provides many other capabilities including a customized Islamic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for handling religious prompts, a Recency RAG for summarizing information about current or recent events that have occurred after the pre-training data cut-off date. The platform provides additional cognitive capabilities including in-house bilingual speech recognition that supports multiple Arabic dialects, voice and image generation that is fine-tuned to better reflect regional characteristics. Finally, Fanar provides an attribution service that can be used to verify the authenticity of fact based generated content.
  The design, development, and implementation of Fanar was entirely undertaken at Hamad Bin Khalifa University's Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) and was sponsored by Qatar's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology to enable sovereign AI technology development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rhea Basappa, Mustafa Tekman, Hong Lu, Benjamin Faught, Sandeep Kakar, Ashok K. Goel</p>
<p>Abstract: Social AI agents interact with members of a community, thereby changing the behavior of the community. For example, in online learning, an AI social assistant may connect learners and thereby enhance social interaction. These social AI assistants too need to explain themselves in order to enhance transparency and trust with the learners. We present a method of self-explanation that uses introspection over a self-model of an AI social assistant. The self-model is captured as a functional model that specifies how the methods of the agent use knowledge to achieve its tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations remain a significant challenge in current Generative AI models, undermining trust in AI systems and their reliability. This study investigates how orchestrating multiple specialized Artificial Intelligent Agents can help mitigate such hallucinations, with a focus on systems leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to facilitate seamless agent interactions. To achieve this, we design a pipeline that introduces over three hundred prompts, purposefully crafted to induce hallucinations, into a front-end agent. The outputs are then systematically reviewed and refined by second- and third-level agents, each employing distinct large language models and tailored strategies to detect unverified claims, incorporate explicit disclaimers, and clarify speculative content. Additionally, we introduce a set of novel Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) specifically designed to evaluate hallucination score levels. A dedicated fourth-level AI agent is employed to evaluate these KPIs, providing detailed assessments and ensuring accurate quantification of shifts in hallucination-related behaviors. A core component of this investigation is the use of the OVON (Open Voice Network) framework, which relies on universal NLP-based interfaces to transfer contextual information among agents. Through structured JSON messages, each agent communicates its assessment of the hallucination likelihood and the reasons underlying questionable content, thereby enabling the subsequent stage to refine the text without losing context. The results demonstrate that employing multiple specialized agents capable of interoperating with each other through NLP-based agentic frameworks can yield promising outcomes in hallucination mitigation, ultimately bolstering trust within the AI community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohitash Chandra, Guoxiang Ren,  Group-H</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an increasing concern about the prevalence of abusive and violent content in Hollywood movies. This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the longitudinal abuse and sentiment analysis of Hollywood Oscar and blockbuster movie dialogues from 1950 to 2024. By employing fine-tuned LLMs, we analyze subtitles for over a thousand movies categorised into four genres to examine the trends and shifts in emotional and abusive content over the past seven decades. Our findings reveal significant temporal changes in movie dialogues, which reflect broader social and cultural influences. Overall, the emotional tendencies in the films are diverse, and the detection of abusive content also exhibits significant fluctuations. The results show a gradual rise in abusive content in recent decades, reflecting social norms and regulatory policy changes. Genres such as thrillers still present a higher frequency of abusive content that emphasises the ongoing narrative role of violence and conflict. At the same time, underlying positive emotions such as humour and optimism remain prevalent in most of the movies. Furthermore, the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues has been significant over the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question: What is the performance and reasoning ability of OpenAI o1 compared to other large language models in addressing ophthalmology-specific questions?
  Findings: This study evaluated OpenAI o1 and five LLMs using 6,990 ophthalmological questions from MedMCQA. O1 achieved the highest accuracy (0.88) and macro-F1 score but ranked third in reasoning capabilities based on text-generation metrics. Across subtopics, o1 ranked first in ``Lens'' and ``Glaucoma'' but second to GPT-4o in ``Corneal and External Diseases'', ``Vitreous and Retina'' and ``Oculoplastic and Orbital Diseases''. Subgroup analyses showed o1 performed better on queries with longer ground truth explanations.
  Meaning: O1's reasoning enhancements may not fully extend to ophthalmology, underscoring the need for domain-specific refinements to optimize performance in specialized fields like ophthalmology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwen Tang, Qiming Guo, Wenbo Sun, Yi Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form mental health assessments pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often exhibit hallucinations or inconsistent reasoning when handling extended, domain-specific contexts. We introduce Stacked Multi-Model Reasoning (SMMR), a layered framework that leverages multiple LLMs and specialized smaller models as coequal 'experts'. Early layers isolate short, discrete subtasks, while later layers integrate and refine these partial outputs through more advanced long-context models. We evaluate SMMR on the DAIC-WOZ depression-screening dataset and 48 curated case studies with psychiatric diagnoses, demonstrating consistent improvements over single-model baselines in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and PHQ-8 error reduction. By harnessing diverse 'second opinions', SMMR mitigates hallucinations, captures subtle clinical nuances, and enhances reliability in high-stakes mental health assessments. Our findings underscore the value of multi-expert frameworks for more trustworthy AI-driven screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyi Zhang, Xingyu Chen, Kexin Chen, Yuyang Du, Xilin Dang, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed extensive efforts to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, alongside growing attention to their ethical implications. However, a critical challenge remains largely overlooked: LLMs must balance between rejecting harmful requests for safety and accommodating legitimate ones for utility. This paper presents a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based alignment framework that achieves better overall performance by addressing this ethical-utility trade-off, using chemical domain applications as a proof-of-concept. Our alignment pipeline starts with a GPT-assisted three-phase data generation scheme, in which we create LibraChemQA, a chemical question-answering dataset comprising 31.6k triplet instances. By incorporating an innovative balanced seed in the data generation process, our framework systematically considers both legitimate and illegitimate requests. The framework also introduces a rephrasing mechanism for efficient data augmentation that enhances the model's chemical comprehension. We further develop a novel hybrid evaluation scheme with LLM judges for precise assessment of both safety and utility. Experimental results demonstrate our model's substantial improvements in overall performance where both safety and utility are considered - our resulting model, LibraChem, outperforms leading LLMs including Claude-3, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3 by margins of 13.44%, 7.16%, and 7.10% respectively on our released benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Xinyu Fang, Chunyi Li, Xiaohong Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Haodong Duan, Kai Chen, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid iteration of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) and the evolving demands of the field, the number of benchmarks produced annually has surged into the hundreds. The rapid growth has inevitably led to significant redundancy among benchmarks. Therefore, it is crucial to take a step back and critically assess the current state of redundancy and propose targeted principles for constructing effective MLLM benchmarks. In this paper, we focus on redundancy from three key perspectives: 1) Redundancy of benchmark capability dimensions, 2) Redundancy in the number of test questions, and 3) Cross-benchmark redundancy within specific domains. Through the comprehensive analysis over hundreds of MLLMs' performance across more than 20 benchmarks, we aim to quantitatively measure the level of redundancy lies in existing MLLM evaluations, provide valuable insights to guide the future development of MLLM benchmarks, and offer strategies to refine and address redundancy issues effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) documents is key standards in global telecommunications, while posing significant challenges for engineers and researchers in the telecommunications field due to the large volume and complexity of their contents as well as the frequent updates. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing tasks, but their general-purpose nature limits their effectiveness in specific domains like telecommunications. To address this, we propose Chat3GPP, an open-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework tailored for 3GPP specifications. By combining chunking strategies, hybrid retrieval and efficient indexing methods, Chat3GPP can efficiently retrieve relevant information and generate accurate responses to user queries without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, which is both flexible and scalable, offering significant potential for adapting to other technical standards beyond 3GPP. We evaluate Chat3GPP on two telecom-specific datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods, showcasing its potential for downstream tasks like protocol generation and code automation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate artificial surveys, with a focus on personal mobility preferences in Germany. By leveraging LLMs for synthetic data creation, we aim to address the limitations of traditional survey methods, such as high costs, inefficiency and scalability challenges. A novel approach incorporating "Personas" - combinations of demographic and behavioural attributes - is introduced and compared to five other synthetic survey methods, which vary in their use of real-world data and methodological complexity. The MiD 2017 dataset, a comprehensive mobility survey in Germany, serves as a benchmark to assess the alignment of synthetic data with real-world patterns. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively capture complex dependencies between demographic attributes and preferences while offering flexibility to explore hypothetical scenarios. This approach presents valuable opportunities for transportation planning and social science research, enabling scalable, cost-efficient and privacy-preserving data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Preston Rasmussen, Pavlo Paliychuk, Travis Beauvais, Jack Ryan, Daniel Chalef</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Zep, a novel memory layer service for AI agents that outperforms the current state-of-the-art system, MemGPT, in the Deep Memory Retrieval (DMR) benchmark. Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks for large language model (LLM)-based agents are limited to static document retrieval, enterprise applications demand dynamic knowledge integration from diverse sources including ongoing conversations and business data. Zep addresses this fundamental limitation through its core component Graphiti -- a temporally-aware knowledge graph engine that dynamically synthesizes both unstructured conversational data and structured business data while maintaining historical relationships. In the DMR benchmark, which the MemGPT team established as their primary evaluation metric, Zep demonstrates superior performance (94.8% vs 93.4%). Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further validated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better reflects enterprise use cases through complex temporal reasoning tasks. In this evaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up to 18.5% while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to baseline implementations. These results are particularly pronounced in enterprise-critical tasks such as cross-session information synthesis and long-term context maintenance, demonstrating Zep's effectiveness for deployment in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jadon Geathers, Yann Hicke, Colleen Chan, Niroop Rajashekar, Justin Sewell, Susannah Cornes, Rene Kizilcec, Dennis Shung</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are widely used to assess medical students' communication skills, but scoring interview-based assessments is time-consuming and potentially subject to human bias. This study explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate OSCE evaluations using the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS).
  Methods. We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), few-shot, and multi-step prompting. The models were benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact, off-by-one, thresholded).
  Results. Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy (0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ($\alpha = 0.98$ for GPT-4o). CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items independent of encounter phases and communication domains.
  Conclusion. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques. Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a foundation for future research in automated assessment of clinical communication skills.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains challenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional fields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time access to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential, traditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical challenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii) difficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii) system efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop reasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms that leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation of LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions.

<p>Abstract: Premise selection is a crucial yet challenging step in mathematical formalization, especially for users with limited experience. Due to the lack of available formalization projects, existing approaches that leverage language models often suffer from data scarcity. In this work, we introduce an innovative method for training a premise retriever to support the formalization of mathematics. Our approach employs a BERT model to embed proof states and premises into a shared latent space. The retrieval model is trained within a contrastive learning framework and incorporates a domain-specific tokenizer along with a fine-grained similarity computation method. Experimental results show that our model is highly competitive compared to existing baselines, achieving strong performance while requiring fewer computational resources. Performance is further enhanced through the integration of a re-ranking module. To streamline the formalization process, we will release a search engine that enables users to query Mathlib theorems directly using proof states, significantly improving accessibility and efficiency.

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has introduced new challenges in securing critical infrastructures against sophisticated cyberthreats. This study presents the development and evaluation of an advanced Intrusion detection (IDS) based on a hybrid LSTM-convolution neural network (CNN)-Attention architecture, specifically designed to detect and classify cyberattacks in IIoT environments. The research focuses on two key classification tasks: binary and multi-class classification. The proposed models was rigorously tested using the Edge-IIoTset dataset. To mitigate the class imbalance in the dataset, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to generate synthetic samples for the underrepresented classes. This ensured that the model could learn effectively from all classes, thereby improving the overall classification performance. Through systematic experimentation, various deep learning (DL) models were compared, ultimately demonstrating that the LSTM-CNN-Attention model consistently outperformed others across key performance metrics. In binary classification, the model achieved near-perfect accuracy, while in multi-class classification, it maintained a high accuracy level (99.04%), effectively categorizing different attack types with a loss value of 0.0220%.</p>

Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of three state-of-the-art commercial VLMs -- GPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in identifying and describing AR scenes. For this purpose, we use DiverseAR, the first AR dataset specifically designed to assess VLMs' ability to analyze virtual content across a wide range of AR scene complexities. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are generally capable of perceiving and describing AR scenes, achieving a True Positive Rate (TPR) of up to 93\% for perception and 71\% for description. While they excel at identifying obvious virtual objects, such as a glowing apple, they struggle when faced with seamlessly integrated content, such as a virtual pot with realistic shadows. Our results highlight both the strengths and the limitations of VLMs in understanding AR scenarios. We identify key factors affecting VLM performance, including virtual content placement, rendering quality, and physical plausibility. This study underscores the potential of VLMs as tools for evaluating the quality of AR experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted method for customizing large-scale language models. In distributed, untrusted training environments, an open source base model user may want to use LoRA weights created by an external contributor, leading to two requirements: (1) the base model user must confirm that the LoRA weights are effective when paired with the intended base model, and (2) the LoRA contributor must keep their proprietary weights private until compensation is assured.
  We present ZKLoRA, a zero-knowledge verification protocol that relies on succinct proofs and our novel Multi-Party Inference procedure to verify LoRA-base model compatibility without exposing LoRA weights. ZKLoRA produces deterministic correctness guarantees and validates each LoRA module in only 1-2 seconds on state-of-the-art large language models. This low-latency approach enables nearly real-time verification and promotes secure collaboration among geographically decentralized teams and contract-based training pipelines. The protocol ensures that the delivered LoRA module works as claimed, safeguarding the contributor's intellectual property while providing the base model user with verification of compatibility and lineage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxuan Che, Yifei Wu, Haibo Jin, Yong Xia, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to train a global model from multiple source domains and ensure its generalization ability to unseen target domains. {Due to the target domain being with unknown domain shifts, attempting to approximate these gaps by source domains may be the key to improving model generalization capability.} Existing works mainly focus on sharing and recombining local domain-specific attributes to increase data diversity and simulate potential domain shifts. {However, these methods may be insufficient since only the local attribute recombination can be hard to touch the out-of-distribution of global data.} In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-efficient framework named Federated Domain Adversarial Generation (FedDAG). {It aims to simulate the domain shift and improve the model generalization by adversarially generating novel domains different from local and global source domains.} Specifically, it generates novel-style images by maximizing the instance-level feature discrepancy between original and generated images and trains a generalizable task model by minimizing their feature discrepancy. {Further, we observed that FedDAG could cause different performance improvements for local models. It may be due to inherent data isolation and heterogeneity among clients, exacerbating the imbalance in their generalization contributions to the global model.} {Ignoring this imbalance can lead the global model's generalization ability to be sub-optimal, further limiting the novel domain generation procedure. } Thus, to mitigate this imbalance, FedDAG hierarchically aggregates local models at the within-client and across-client levels by using the sharpness concept to evaluate client model generalization contributions. {Extensive experiments across four medical benchmarks demonstrate FedDAG's ability to enhance generalization in federated medical scenarios.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncen Long, Gianluca Bardaro, Simone Mentasti, Matteo Matteucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The prevalence of harmful content on social media platforms poses significant risks to users and society, necessitating more effective and scalable content moderation strategies. Current approaches rely on human moderators, supervised classifiers, and large volumes of training data, and often struggle with scalability, subjectivity, and the dynamic nature of harmful content (e.g., violent content, dangerous challenge trends, etc.). To bridge these gaps, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to undertake few-shot dynamic content moderation via in-context learning. Through extensive experiments on multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that our few-shot approaches can outperform existing proprietary baselines (Perspective and OpenAI Moderation) as well as prior state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, in identifying harm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajvardhan Oak, Muhammad Haroon, Claire Jo, Magdalena Wojcieszak, Anshuman Chhabra</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered recommendation algorithms to maximize user engagement, which can result in inadvertent exposure to harmful content. Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary moderation approaches, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for harm mitigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyeop Yeo, Seung-won Hwang, Yu-Seung Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has gained significant attention in recent years. Existing methods often aim to improve the quality of generated code by incorporating additional contextual information or guidance into input prompts. Many of these approaches adopt sequential reasoning strategies, mimicking human-like step-by-step thinking. However, such strategies may constrain flexibility, as they do not always align with the structured characteristics of programming languages. This paper introduces the Chain of Grounded Objectives (CGO), a method that embeds functional objectives into input prompts to enhance code generation. By leveraging appropriately structured objectives as input and avoiding explicit sequential procedures, CGO adapts effectively to the structured nature of programming tasks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGO effectively enhances code generation, addressing limitations of existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive-scale corpora, the issue of data contamination has become increasingly severe, leading to potential overestimation of model performance during evaluation. To address this, we propose AdEval (Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation), a dynamic data evaluation method aimed at mitigating the impact of data contamination on evaluation reliability. AdEval extracts key knowledge points and main ideas to align dynamically generated questions with static data's core concepts. It also leverages online search to provide detailed explanations of related knowledge points, thereby creating high-quality evaluation samples with robust knowledge support. Furthermore, AdEval incorporates mechanisms to control the number and complexity of questions, enabling dynamic alignment and flexible adjustment. This ensures that the generated questions align with the complexity of static data while supporting varied complexity levels. Based on Bloom's taxonomy, AdEval conducts a multi-dimensional evaluation of LLMs across six cognitive levels: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that AdEval effectively reduces the impact of data contamination on evaluation outcomes, enhancing both the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhumika Gupta, Pralaypati Ta, Keerthi Ram, Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam</p>
<p>Abstract: The updated recommendations on diagnostic procedures and treatment pathways for a medical condition are documented as graphical flows in Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). For effective use of the CPGs in helping medical professionals in the treatment decision process, it is necessary to fully capture the guideline knowledge, particularly the contexts and their relationships in the graph. While several existing works have utilized these guidelines to create rule bases for Clinical Decision Support Systems, limited work has been done toward directly capturing the full medical knowledge contained in CPGs. This work proposes an approach to create a contextually enriched, faithful digital representation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Cancer CPGs in the form of graphs using automated extraction and node & relationship classification. We also implement semantic enrichment of the model by using Large Language Models (LLMs) for node classification, achieving an accuracy of 80.86% and 88.47% with zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a methodology for answering natural language questions with constraints to guideline text by leveraging LLMs to extract the relevant subgraph from the guideline knowledge base. By generating natural language answers based on subgraph paths and semantic information, we mitigate the risk of incorrect answers and hallucination associated with LLMs, ensuring factual accuracy in medical domain Question Answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baochen Xiong, Xiaoshan Yang, Yaguang Song, Yaowei Wang, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel federated multimodal instruction tuning task(FedMIT), which is significant for collaboratively fine-tuning MLLMs on different types of multimodal instruction data on distributed devices. To solve the new task, we propose a federated multimodal instruction tuning framework(Pilot). Our framework integrates two stages of "adapter on adapter" into the connector of the vision encoder and the LLM. In stage 1, we extract task-specific features and client-specific features from visual information. In stage 2, we build the cross-task Mixture-of-Adapters(CT-MoA) module to perform cross-task interaction. Each client can not only capture personalized information of local data and learn task-related multimodal information, but also learn general knowledge from other tasks. In addition, we introduce an adaptive parameter aggregation strategy for text training parameters, which optimizes parameter aggregation by calculating weights based on the euclidean distance between parameters, so that parameter aggregation can benefit from positive effects to the greatest extent while effectively reducing negative effects. Our framework can collaboratively exploit distributed data from different local clients to learn cross-task knowledge without being affected by the task heterogeneity during instruction tuning. The effectiveness of our method is verified in two different cross-task scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Bharadwaj, Austin Scott Glover, Aydin Buluc, James Demmel</p>
<p>Abstract: Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e., networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state-of-the-art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Hu, Yuan Cheng, Dawei Yang, Zukang Xu, Zhihang Yuan, Jiangyong Yu, Chen Xu, Zhe Jiang, Sifan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs). The major challenge in LLM quantization is that uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions can expand the quantization range, thereby reducing bit precision for most values. Recent methods attempt to eliminate outliers and balance inter-channel differences by employing linear transformations; however, they remain heuristic and are often overlook optimizing the data distribution across the entire quantization space.In this paper, we introduce Quantization Space Utilization Rate (QSUR), a novel metric that effectively assesses the quantizability of transformed data by measuring the space utilization of the data in the quantization space. We complement QSUR with mathematical derivations that examine the effects and limitations of various transformations, guiding our development of Orthogonal and Scaling Transformation-based Quantization (OSTQuant). OSQuant employs a learnable equivalent transformation, consisting of an orthogonal transformation and a scaling transformation, to optimize the distributions of weights and activations across the entire quantization space. Futhermore, we propose the KL-Top loss function, designed to mitigate noise during optimization while retaining richer semantic information within the limited calibration data imposed by PTQ. OSTQuant outperforms existing work on various LLMs and benchmarks. In the W4-only setting, it retains 99.5\% of the floating-point accuracy. In the more challenging W4A4KV4 configuration, OSTQuant reduces the performance gap by 32\% on the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to state-of-the-art methods. \href{https://github.com/BrotherHappy/OSTQuant}{https://github.com/BrotherHappy/OSTQuant}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yang, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most studies on environmental perception for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focus on urban traffic environments, where the objects/stuff to be perceived are mainly from man-made scenes and scalable datasets with dense annotations can be used to train supervised learning models. By contrast, it is hard to densely annotate a large-scale off-road driving dataset manually due to the inherently unstructured nature of off-road environments. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Contrastive Representation Learning approach for Off-Road environmental perception, namely MCRL4OR. This approach aims to jointly learn three encoders for processing visual images, locomotion states, and control actions by aligning the locomotion states with the fused features of visual images and control actions within a contrastive learning framework. The causation behind this alignment strategy is that the inertial locomotion state is the result of taking a certain control action under the current landform/terrain condition perceived by visual sensors. In experiments, we pre-train the MCRL4OR with a large-scale off-road driving dataset and adopt the learned multimodal representations for various downstream perception tasks in off-road driving scenarios. The superior performance in downstream tasks demonstrates the advantages of the pre-trained multimodal representations. The codes can be found in \url{https://github.com/1uciusy/MCRL4OR}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhen Yue, Yong Liu, Xianghua Ying, Bowei Xing, Ruohao Guo, Ji Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents \textbf{FreEformer}, a simple yet effective model that leverages a \textbf{Fre}quency \textbf{E}nhanced Trans\textbf{former} for multivariate time series forecasting. Our work is based on the assumption that the frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of series across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust representation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the complex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Transformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture cross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed independently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a low-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be attributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the strong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this, we enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional learnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1 normalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention mechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity, traffic, weather, healthcare and finance. Notably, the enhanced attention mechanism also consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art Transformer-based forecasters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhou, Hao-Zhe Tan, Peng-Xiao Song, Lan-Zhe Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable performance recently, and thus model hubs have emerged. Existing model hubs typically assume basic text matching is sufficient to search for models. However, in reality, due to different abstractions and the large number of models in model hubs, it is not easy for users to review model descriptions and example images, choosing which model best meets their needs. Therefore, it is necessary to describe model functionality wisely so that future users can efficiently search for the most suitable model for their needs. Efforts to address this issue remain limited. In this paper, we propose Conditional Generative Model Identification (CGI), which aims to provide an effective way to identify the most suitable model using user-provided example images rather than requiring users to manually review a large number of models with example images. To address this problem, we propose the PromptBased Model Identification (PMI) , which can adequately describe model functionality and precisely match requirements with specifications. To evaluate PMI approach and promote related research, we provide a benchmark comprising 65 models and 9100 identification tasks. Extensive experimental and human evaluation results demonstrate that PMI is effective. For instance, 92% of models are correctly identified with significantly better FID scores when four example images are provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hy Nguyen, Nguyen Hung Nguyen, Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen, Srikanth Thudumu, Hung Du, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is widely used for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, leveraging the principles of navigable small-world graphs. However, it faces some limitations. The first is the local optima problem, which arises from the algorithm's greedy search strategy, selecting neighbors based solely on proximity at each step. This often leads to cluster disconnections. The second limitation is that HNSW frequently fails to achieve logarithmic complexity, particularly in high-dimensional datasets, due to the exhaustive traversal through each layer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that mitigates local optima and cluster disconnections while enhancing the construction speed, maintaining inference speed. The first component is a dual-branch HNSW structure with LID-based insertion mechanisms, enabling traversal from multiple directions. This improves outlier node capture, enhances cluster connectivity, accelerates construction speed and reduces the risk of local minima. The second component incorporates a bridge-building technique that bypasses redundant intermediate layers, maintaining inference and making up the additional computational overhead introduced by the dual-branch structure. Experiments on various benchmarks and datasets showed that our algorithm outperforms the original HNSW in both accuracy and speed. We evaluated six datasets across Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing recall improvements of 18\% in NLP, and up to 30\% in CV tasks while reducing the construction time by up to 20\% and maintaining the inference speed. We did not observe any trade-offs in our algorithm. Ablation studies revealed that LID-based insertion had the greatest impact on performance, followed by the dual-branch structure and bridge-building components.</p>

<p>Abstract: The introduction of new features and services in the banking sector often overwhelms customers, creating an opportunity for banks to enhance user experience through financial chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). We initiated an AI agent designed to provide customers with relevant information about banking services and insights from annual reports. We proposed a hybrid Customer Analysis Pipeline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CAPRAG) that effectively addresses both relationship-based and contextual queries, thereby improving customer engagement in the digital banking landscape. To implement this, we developed a processing pipeline to refine text data, which we utilized in two main frameworks: Vector RAG and Graph RAG. This dual approach enables us to populate both vector and graph databases with processed data for efficient retrieval. The Cypher query component is employed to effectively query the graph database. When a user submits a query, it is first expanded by a query expansion module before being routed to construct a final query from the hybrid Knowledge Base (KB). This final query is then sent to an open-source LLM for response generation. Overall, our innovative, designed to international banks, serves bank's customers in an increasingly complex digital environment, enhancing clarity and accessibility of information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hy Nguyen, Bao Pham, Hung Du, Srikanth Thudumu, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Object Tracking is essential for many computer vision applications, such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics. Unlike Passive Object Tracking (POT), which relies on static camera viewpoints to detect and track objects across consecutive frames, Active Object Tracking (AOT) requires a controller agent to actively adjust its viewpoint to maintain visual contact with a moving target in complex environments. Existing AOT solutions are predominantly single-agent-based, which struggle in dynamic and complex scenarios due to limited information gathering and processing capabilities, often resulting in suboptimal decision-making. Alleviating these limitations necessitates the development of a multi-agent system where different agents perform distinct roles and collaborate to enhance learning and robustness in dynamic and complex environments. Although some multi-agent approaches exist for AOT, they typically rely on external auxiliary agents, which require additional devices, making them costly. In contrast, we introduce the Collaborative System for Active Object Tracking (CSAOT), a method that leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to enable multiple agents to operate on a single device, thereby improving tracking performance and reducing costs. Our approach enhances robustness against occlusions and rapid motion while optimizing camera movements to extend tracking duration. We validated the effectiveness of CSAOT on various interactive maps with dynamic and stationary obstacles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predictive models are highly advanced in understanding the mechanisms of brain function. Recent advances in machine learning further underscore the power of prediction for optimal representation in learning. However, there remains a gap in creating a biologically plausible model that explains how the neural system achieves prediction. In this paper, we introduce a framework that employs an energy-based model (EBM) to capture the nuanced processes of predicting observation after action within the neural system, encompassing prediction, learning, and inference. We implement the EBM with a hierarchical structure and integrate a continuous attractor neural network for memory, constructing a biologically plausible model. In experimental evaluations, our model demonstrates efficacy across diverse scenarios. The range of actions includes eye movement, motion in environments, head turning, and static observation while the environment changes. Our model not only makes accurate predictions for environments it was trained on, but also provides reasonable predictions for unseen environments, matching the performances of machine learning methods in multiple tasks. We hope that this study contributes to a deep understanding of how the neural system performs prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: The organization of latent knowledge within large-scale models poses unique challenges when addressing overlapping representations and optimizing contextual accuracy. Conceptual redundancies embedded across layers often result in inefficiencies that affect both computational demands and task-specific outcomes. A framework was proposed to restructure these redundancies through advanced clustering techniques and dynamic thresholding, ensuring that critical semantic relationships are preserved while removing unnecessary overlaps. Evaluations revealed improved memory efficiency and faster inference times, alongside better alignment in latent knowledge clusters that enhanced interpretability. Improvements in error rates and adversarial robustness suggest that restructuring redundancies has broader implications for increasing model reliability across diverse applications. Comparative analyses highlighted reductions in resource consumption and notable gains in performance, particularly in translation and summarization tasks. Energy metrics demonstrated significant savings during training phases, further validating the practicality of the approach for real-world deployments. Representational fidelity was also enhanced, with latent space evaluations indicating better cluster alignment and higher semantic consistency. The methodology bridges a key gap in model optimization through directly addressing redundancies at the structural level. Its application opens avenues for scalable, efficient, and contextually aware systems that can adapt to complex, domain-specific tasks without compromising on performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hy Nguyen, Duy Khoa Pham, Srikanth Thudumu, Hung Du, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) often relies on a fixed activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) for all nodes within the hidden layers. While effective in many scenarios, this uniformity may limit the networks ability to capture complex data patterns. We argue that employing the same activation function at every node is suboptimal and propose leveraging different activation functions at each node to increase flexibility and adaptability. To achieve this, we introduce Local Control Networks (LCNs), which leverage B-spline functions to enable distinct activation curves at each node. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the properties and benefits of LCNs over conventional MLPs. In addition, we demonstrate that more complex architectures, such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), are unnecessary in certain scenarios, and LCNs can be a more efficient alternative. Empirical experiments on various benchmarks and datasets validate our theoretical findings. In computer vision tasks, LCNs achieve marginal improvements over MLPs and outperform KANs by approximately 5\%, while also being more computationally efficient than KANs. In basic machine learning tasks, LCNs show a 1\% improvement over MLPs and a 0.6\% improvement over KANs. For symbolic formula representation tasks, LCNs perform on par with KANs, with both architectures outperforming MLPs. Our findings suggest that diverse activations at the node level can lead to improved performance and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kelp forests, as foundation species, are vital to marine ecosystems, providing essential food and habitat for numerous organisms. This study explores the integration of crowdsourced labels with advanced artificial intelligence models to develop a fast and accurate kelp canopy detection pipeline using Landsat images. Building on the success of a machine learning competition, where this approach ranked third and performed consistently well on both local validation and public and private leaderboards, the research highlights the effectiveness of combining Mixed Vision Transformers (MIT) with ConvNeXt models. Training these models on various image sizes significantly enhanced the accuracy of the ensemble results. U-Net emerged as the best segmentation architecture, with UpperNet also contributing to the final ensemble. Key Landsat bands, such as ShortWave InfraRed (SWIR1) and Near-InfraRed (NIR), were crucial while altitude data was used in postprocessing to eliminate false positives on land. The methodology achieved a high detection rate, accurately identifying about three out of four pixels containing kelp canopy while keeping false positives low. Despite the medium resolution of Landsat satellites, their extensive historical coverage makes them effective for studying kelp forests. This work also underscores the potential of combining machine learning models with crowdsourced data for effective and scalable environmental monitoring.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zui Chen, Tianqiao Liu, Mi Tian, Qing Tong, Weiqi Luo, Zitao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have significantly expanded their capabilities across various domains. However, mathematical reasoning remains a challenging area, prompting the development of math-specific LLMs. These models typically follow a two-stage training paradigm: pre-training with math-related corpora and post-training with problem datasets for SFT. Despite these efforts, the improvements in mathematical reasoning achieved through continued pre-training (CPT) are often less significant compared to those obtained via SFT. This study addresses this discrepancy by exploring alternative strategies during the pre-training phase, focusing on the use of problem-solving data over general mathematical corpora. We investigate three primary research questions: (1) Can problem-solving data enhance the model's mathematical reasoning capabilities more effectively than general mathematical corpora during CPT? (2) Are synthetic data from the same source equally effective, and which synthesis methods are most efficient? (3) How do the capabilities developed from the same problem-solving data differ between the CPT and SFT stages, and what factors contribute to these differences? Our findings indicate that problem-solving data significantly enhances the model's mathematical capabilities compared to general mathematical corpora. We also identify effective data synthesis methods, demonstrating that the tutorship amplification synthesis method achieves the best performance. Furthermore, while SFT facilitates instruction-following abilities, it underperforms compared to CPT with the same data, which can be partially attributed to its poor learning capacity for hard multi-step problem-solving data. These insights provide valuable guidance for optimizing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, culminating in our development of a powerful mathematical base model called JiuZhang-8B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfei Ling, Zijie Liu, Jun Du, Yao Huang, Yuehang Wang, Bingjia Xiao, Xin Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: An accurate evolution model is crucial for effective control and in-depth study of fusion plasmas. Evolution methods based on physical models often encounter challenges such as insufficient robustness or excessive computational costs. Given the proven strong fitting capabilities of deep learning methods across various fields, including plasma research, this paper introduces a deep learning-based magnetic measurement evolution method named PaMMA-Net (Plasma Magnetic Measurements Incremental Accumulative Prediction Network). This network is capable of evolving magnetic measurements in tokamak discharge experiments over extended periods or, in conjunction with equilibrium reconstruction algorithms, evolving macroscopic parameters such as plasma shape. Leveraging a incremental prediction approach and data augmentation techniques tailored for magnetic measurements, PaMMA-Net achieves superior evolution results compared to existing studies. The tests conducted on real experimental data from EAST validate the high generalization capability of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luqi Zhang, Haiping Wang, Chong Liu, Zhen Dong, Bisheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The point clouds collected by the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) system provide accurate 3D information of urban land covers. By utilizing multi-temporal ALS point clouds, semantic changes in urban area can be captured, demonstrating significant potential in urban planning, emergency management, and infrastructure maintenance. Existing 3D change detection methods struggle to efficiently extract multi-class semantic information and change features, still facing the following challenges: (1) the difficulty of accurately modeling cross-temporal point clouds spatial relationships for effective change feature extraction; (2) class imbalance of change samples which hinders distinguishability of semantic features; (3) the lack of real-world datasets for 3D semantic change detection. To resolve these challenges, we propose the Multi-task Enhanced Cross-temporal Point Transformer (ME-CPT) network. ME-CPT establishes spatiotemporal correspondences between point cloud across different epochs and employs attention mechanisms to jointly extract semantic change features, facilitating information exchange and change comparison. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic segmentation task and through the multi-task training strategy, further enhance the distinguishability of semantic features, reducing the impact of class imbalance in change types. Moreover, we release a 22.5 $km^2$ 3D semantic change detection dataset, offering diverse scenes for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed MT-CPT achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Deep-learning-based face recognition (FR) systems are susceptible to adversarial examples in both digital and physical domains. Physical attacks present a greater threat to deployed systems as adversaries can easily access the input channel, allowing them to provide malicious inputs to impersonate a victim. This paper addresses the limitations of existing projector-camera-based adversarial light attacks in practical FR setups. By incorporating device-aware adaptations into the digital attack algorithm, such as resolution-aware and color-aware adjustments, we mitigate the degradation from digital to physical domains. Experimental validation showcases the efficacy of our proposed algorithm against real and spoof adversaries, achieving high physical similarity scores in FR models and state-of-the-art commercial systems. On average, there is only a 14% reduction in scores from digital to physical attacks, with high attack success rate in both white- and black-box scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation, at the heart of counterfactual reasoning, is a crucial challenge for causal modeling both theoretically and applicatively, in domains such as healthcare, sociology, or advertising. Borrowing domain adaptation principles, a popular design maps the sample representation to a latent space that balances control and treated populations while enabling the prediction of the potential outcomes. This paper presents a new CATE estimation approach based on the asymmetrical search for two latent spaces called Asymmetrical Latent Representation for Individual Treatment Effect (ALRITE), where the two latent spaces are respectively intended to optimize the counterfactual prediction accuracy on the control and the treated samples. Under moderate assumptions, ALRITE admits an upper bound on the precision of the estimation of heterogeneous effects (PEHE), and the approach is empirically successfully validated compared to the state-of-the-art</p>

<p>Abstract: Noise remains a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, significantly affecting pulse fidelity and overall circuit performance. This paper introduces an adaptive algorithm for pulse-level quantum error mitigation, designed to enhance fidelity by dynamically responding to noise conditions without modifying circuit gates. By targeting pulse parameters directly, this method reduces the impact of various noise sources, improving algorithm resilience in quantum circuits. We show the latter by applying our protocol to Grover's and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms. Experimental results show that this pulse-level strategy provides a flexible and efficient solution for increasing fidelity during the noisy execution of quantum circuits. Our work contributes to advancements in error mitigation techniques, essential for robust quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Parameshwaran, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing formal verification methods for image-based neural network controllers in autonomous vehicles often struggle with high-dimensional inputs, computational inefficiency, and a lack of explainability. These challenges make it difficult to ensure safety and reliability, as processing high-dimensional image data is computationally intensive and neural networks are typically treated as black boxes. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{SEVIN} (Scalable and Explainable Verification of Image-Based Neural Network Controllers), a framework that leverages a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to encode high-dimensional images into a lower-dimensional, explainable latent space. By annotating latent variables with corresponding control actions, we generate convex polytopes that serve as structured input spaces for verification, significantly reducing computational complexity and enhancing scalability. Integrating the VAE's decoder with the neural network controller allows for formal and robustness verification using these explainable polytopes. Our approach also incorporates robustness verification under real-world perturbations by augmenting the dataset and retraining the VAE to capture environmental variations. Experimental results demonstrate that SEVIN achieves efficient and scalable verification while providing explainable insights into controller behavior, bridging the gap between formal verification techniques and practical applications in safety-critical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaiqun Pan, Diederick Vermetten, Manuel L\'opez-Ib\'a\~nez, Thomas B\"ack, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Surrogate models are frequently employed as efficient substitutes for the costly execution of real-world processes. However, constructing a high-quality surrogate model often demands extensive data acquisition. A solution to this issue is to transfer pre-trained surrogate models for new tasks, provided that certain invariances exist between tasks. This study focuses on transferring non-differentiable surrogate models (e.g., random forest) from a source function to a target function, where we assume their domains are related by an unknown affine transformation, using only a limited amount of transfer data points evaluated on the target. Previous research attempts to tackle this challenge for differentiable models, e.g., Gaussian process regression, which minimizes the empirical loss on the transfer data by tuning the affine transformations. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the random forest model and assess its effectiveness on a widely-used artificial problem set - Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed, and on four real-world transfer learning problems. The results highlight the significant practical advantages of the proposed method, particularly in reducing both the data requirements and computational costs of training surrogate models for complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinya Wang, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Boah Kim, Ronald M. Summers</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiphase CT studies are routinely obtained in clinical practice for diagnosis and management of various diseases, such as cancer. However, the CT studies can be acquired with low radiation doses, different scanners, and are frequently affected by motion and metal artifacts. Prior approaches have targeted the quality improvement of one specific CT phase (e.g., non-contrast CT). In this work, we hypothesized that leveraging multiple CT phases for the quality enhancement of one phase may prove advantageous for downstream tasks, such as segmentation. A 3D progressive fusion and non-local (PFNL) network was developed. It was trained with three degraded (low-quality) phases (non-contrast, arterial, and portal venous) to enhance the quality of the portal venous phase. Then, the effect of scan quality enhancement was evaluated using a proxy task of pancreas segmentation, which is useful for tracking pancreatic cancer. The proposed approach improved the pancreas segmentation by 3% over the corresponding low-quality CT scan. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to harness multiphase CT for scan quality enhancement and improved pancreas segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sneh Pandya, Purvik Patel, Brian D. Nord, Mike Walmsley, Aleksandra \'Ciprijanovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.</p>

<p>Abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their reasoning. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; meanwhile, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text). We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Krogh Petersen, Valdemar Licht, Mads Nielsen, Asbj{\o}rn Munk</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal models require aligned, shared embedding spaces. However, common CLIP-based approaches need large amounts of samples and do not natively support 3D or tabular data, both of which are crucial in the medical domain. To address these issues, we revisit CLIP-style alignment by training a domain-specific 3D foundation model as an image encoder and demonstrate that modality alignment is feasible with only 62 MRI scans. Our approach is enabled by a simple embedding accumulation strategy required for training in 3D, which scales the amount of negative pairs across batches in order to stabilize training. We perform a thorough evaluation of various design choices, including the choice of backbone and loss functions, and evaluate the proposed methodology on zero-shot classification and image-retrieval tasks. While zero-shot image-retrieval remains challenging, zero-shot classification results demonstrate that the proposed approach can meaningfully align the representations of 3D MRI with tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignav Ramesh, Kenneth Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication between multiple language model (LM) agents has been shown to scale up the reasoning ability of LMs. While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative "language" for communication between LMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting sections from clinical notes is crucial for downstream analysis but is challenging due to variability in formatting and labor-intensive nature of manual sectioning. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, privacy concerns limit their accessibility.

We fine-tuned three open-source LLMs to extract sections using a curated dataset of 487 progress notes, comparing results relative to proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini). Internal and external validity were assessed via precision, recall and F1 score. Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B outperformed GPT-4o (F1=0.92). On the external validity test set, performance remained high (F1= 0.85). Fine-tuned open-source LLMs can surpass proprietary models in clinical note sectioning, offering advantages in cost, performance, and accessibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Derek Yotheringhay, Alistair Kirkland, Humphrey Kirkbride, Josiah Whitesteeple</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformative innovations in model architectures have introduced hierarchical embedding augmentation as a means to redefine the representation of tokens through multi-level semantic structures, offering enhanced adaptability to complex linguistic inputs. Autonomous structural memory manipulation further advances this paradigm through dynamic memory reallocation mechanisms that prioritize critical contextual features while suppressing less relevant information, enabling scalable and efficient performance across diverse tasks. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in computational efficiency, with marked reductions in processing overhead for longer input sequences, achieved through memory reorganization strategies that adapt to evolving contextual requirements. Hierarchical embeddings not only improved contextual alignment but also facilitated task generalization by capturing relationships at varying semantic granularities, ensuring coherence across layers without introducing significant computational redundancies. Comparative analysis against baseline models demonstrated unique advantages in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, particularly in tasks requiring complex contextual understanding or domain-specific adaptability. The ability to dynamically adjust token representations and memory configurations contributed to the model's robustness under varied and unpredictable input conditions. Applications benefiting from these advancements include multi-domain generalization, interactive systems, and scenarios involving real-time decision-making, where traditional static memory architectures often face limitations. The proposed methodology combines advanced embedding and memory management strategies into a cohesive framework that addresses scalability challenges while preserving task-specific relevance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning Platform for Adversarial Black-box untargeted and targeted attacks, RLAB, that allows users to select from various distortion filters to create adversarial examples. The platform uses a Reinforcement Learning agent to add minimum distortion to input images while still causing misclassification by the target model. The agent uses a novel dual-action method to explore the input image at each step to identify sensitive regions for adding distortions while removing noises that have less impact on the target model. This dual action leads to faster and more efficient convergence of the attack. The platform can also be used to measure the robustness of image classification models against specific distortion types. Also, retraining the model with adversarial samples significantly improved robustness when evaluated on benchmark datasets. The proposed platform outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average number of queries required to cause misclassification. This advances trustworthiness with a positive social impact.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality and provides comprehensive anatomical and functional insights into the human body. However, its long acquisition times can lead to patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, strategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple receiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally, compressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from sparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the amount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with parallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI reconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for MRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods, including end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning, highlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights significant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI reconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based MRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration factors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based MRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging.

To address these challenges, we developed LoCoML, a low-code framework designed to simplify the integration of diverse ML models within the context of the \textit{Bhashini Project} - a large-scale initiative aimed at integrating AI-driven language technologies such as automatic speech recognition, machine translation, text-to-speech, and optical character recognition to support seamless communication across more than 20 languages. Initial evaluations show that LoCoML adds only a small amount of computational load, making it efficient and effective for large-scale ML integration. Our practical insights show that a low-code approach can be a practical solution for connecting multiple ML models in a collaborative environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong-Duy Nguyen, Xiaobao Wu, Thong Nguyen, Shuai Zhao, Khoi Le, Viet-Anh Nguyen, Feng Yichao, Anh Tuan Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous research on multimodal entity linking (MEL) has primarily employed contrastive learning as the primary objective. However, using the rest of the batch as negative samples without careful consideration, these studies risk leveraging easy features and potentially overlook essential details that make entities unique. In this work, we propose JD-CCL (Jaccard Distance-based Conditional Contrastive Learning), a novel approach designed to enhance the ability to match multimodal entity linking models. JD-CCL leverages meta-information to select negative samples with similar attributes, making the linking task more challenging and robust. Additionally, to address the limitations caused by the variations within the visual modality among mentions and entities, we introduce a novel method, CVaCPT (Contextual Visual-aid Controllable Patch Transform). It enhances visual representations by incorporating multi-view synthetic images and contextual textual representations to scale and shift patch representations. Experimental results on benchmark MEL datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suresh Babu Nettur, Shanthi Karpurapu, Unnati Nettur, Likhit Sagar Gajja, Sravanthy Myneni, Akhil Dusi, Lalithya Posham</p>
<p>Abstract: Lightweight deep learning approaches for malaria detection have gained attention for their potential to enhance diagnostics in resource constrained environments. For our study, we selected SqueezeNet1.1 as it is one of the most popular lightweight architectures. SqueezeNet1.1 is a later version of SqueezeNet1.0 and is 2.4 times more computationally efficient than the original model. We proposed and implemented three ultra-lightweight architecture variants to SqueezeNet1.1 architecture, namely Variant 1 (one fire module), Variant 2 (two fire modules), and Variant 3 (four fire modules), which are even more compact than SqueezeNetV1.1 (eight fire modules). These models were implemented to evaluate the best performing variant that achieves superior computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in malaria blood cell classification. The models were trained and evaluated using the NIH Malaria dataset. We assessed each model's performance based on metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The results show that the SqueezeNet1.1 model achieves the highest performance across all metrics, with a classification accuracy of 97.12%. Variant 3 (four fire modules) offers a competitive alternative, delivering almost identical results (accuracy 96.55%) with a 6x reduction in computational overhead compared to SqueezeNet1.1. Variant 2 and Variant 1 perform slightly lower than Variant 3, with Variant 2 (two fire modules) reducing computational overhead by 28x, and Variant 1 (one fire module) achieving a 54x reduction in trainable parameters compared to SqueezeNet1.1. These findings demonstrate that our SqueezeNet1.1 architecture variants provide a flexible approach to malaria detection, enabling the selection of a variant that balances resource constraints and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyeob Baek, Yi-Fu Wu, Gautam Singh, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have an innate ability to decompose their perceptions of the world into objects and their attributes, such as colors, shapes, and movement patterns. This cognitive process enables us to imagine novel futures by recombining familiar concepts. However, replicating this ability in artificial intelligence systems has proven challenging, particularly when it comes to modeling videos into compositional concepts and generating unseen, recomposed futures without relying on auxiliary data, such as text, masks, or bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose Dreamweaver, a neural architecture designed to discover hierarchical and compositional representations from raw videos and generate compositional future simulations. Our approach leverages a novel Recurrent Block-Slot Unit (RBSU) to decompose videos into their constituent objects and attributes. In addition, Dreamweaver uses a multi-future-frame prediction objective to capture disentangled representations for dynamic concepts more effectively as well as static concepts. In experiments, we demonstrate our model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for world modeling when evaluated under the DCI framework across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we show how the modularized concept representations of our model enable compositional imagination, allowing the generation of novel videos by recombining attributes from different objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micah Rentschler, Jesse Roberts</p>
<p>Abstract: What if artificial intelligence could not only solve problems for which it was trained but also learn to teach itself to solve new problems (i.e., meta-learn)? In this study, we demonstrate that a pre-trained transformer fine-tuned with reinforcement learning over multiple episodes develops the ability to solve problems that it has never encountered before - an emergent ability called In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL). This powerful meta-learner not only excels in solving unseen in-distribution environments with remarkable sample efficiency, but also shows strong performance in out-of-distribution environments. In addition, we show that it exhibits robustness to the quality of its training data, seamlessly stitches together behaviors from its context, and adapts to non-stationary environments. These behaviors demonstrate that an RL-trained transformer can iteratively improve upon its own solutions, making it an excellent general-purpose problem solver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhyeok Kang, Yooju Shin, Jae-Gil Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Variate tokenization, which independently embeds each variate as separate tokens, has achieved remarkable improvements in multivariate time series forecasting. However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present ENTER, an interpretable Video Question Answering (VideoQA) system based on event graphs. Event graphs convert videos into graphical representations, where video events form the nodes and event-event relationships (temporal/causal/hierarchical) form the edges. This structured representation offers many benefits: 1) Interpretable VideoQA via generated code that parses event-graph; 2) Incorporation of contextual visual information in the reasoning process (code generation) via event graphs; 3) Robust VideoQA via Hierarchical Iterative Update of the event graphs. Existing interpretable VideoQA systems are often top-down, disregarding low-level visual information in the reasoning plan generation, and are brittle. While bottom-up approaches produce responses from visual data, they lack interpretability. Experimental results on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema demonstrate that not only does our method outperform existing top-down approaches while obtaining competitive performance against bottom-up approaches, but more importantly, offers superior interpretability and explainability in the reasoning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Hu, Tingting Dong, Sen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, termed Reward-Guided Conservative Q-learning (RG-CQL), to enhance coordination between ride-pooling and public transit within a multimodal transportation network. We model each ride-pooling vehicle as an agent governed by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose an offline training and online fine-tuning RL framework to learn the optimal operational decisions of the multimodal transportation systems, including rider-vehicle matching, selection of drop-off locations for passengers, and vehicle routing decisions, with improved data efficiency. During the offline training phase, we develop a Conservative Double Deep Q Network (CDDQN) as the action executor and a supervised learning-based reward estimator, termed the Guider Network, to extract valuable insights into action-reward relationships from data batches. In the online fine-tuning phase, the Guider Network serves as an exploration guide, aiding CDDQN in effectively and conservatively exploring unknown state-action pairs. The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated through a realistic case study using real-world data from Manhattan. We show that integrating ride-pooling with public transit outperforms two benchmark cases solo rides coordinated with transit and ride-pooling without transit coordination by 17% and 22% in the achieved system rewards, respectively. Furthermore, our innovative offline training and online fine-tuning framework offers a remarkable 81.3% improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional online RL methods with adequate exploration budgets, with a 4.3% increase in total rewards and a 5.6% reduction in overestimation errors. Experimental results further demonstrate that RG-CQL effectively addresses the challenges of transitioning from offline to online RL in large-scale ride-pooling systems integrated with transit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Liang, Chaofeng Guan, Jiaying Lu, Huiyao Chen, Huan Wang, Haoji Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable success in multimodal tasks but face practical limitations due to the quadratic complexity of decoder attention mechanisms and autoregressive generation. Existing methods like FASTV and VTW have achieved notable results in reducing redundant visual tokens, but these approaches focus on pruning tokens in a single forward pass without systematically analyzing the redundancy of visual tokens throughout the entire generation process. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy tailored for VLMs, namedDynamic Rate (DyRate), which progressively adjusts the compression rate during generation. Our analysis of the distribution of attention reveals that the importance of visual tokens decreases throughout the generation process, inspiring us to adopt a more aggressive compression rate. By integrating a lightweight predictor based on attention distribution, our approach enables flexible adjustment of pruning rates based on the attention distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational demands but also maintains the quality of responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hammad Ayyubi, Xuande Feng, Junzhang Liu, Xudong Lin, Zhecan Wang, Shih-Fu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of predicting time and location from images is challenging and requires complex human-like puzzle-solving ability over different clues. In this work, we formalize this ability into core skills and implement them using different modules in an expert pipeline called PuzzleGPT. PuzzleGPT consists of a perceiver to identify visual clues, a reasoner to deduce prediction candidates, a combiner to combinatorially combine information from different clues, a web retriever to get external knowledge if the task can't be solved locally, and a noise filter for robustness. This results in a zero-shot, interpretable, and robust approach that records state-of-the-art performance on two datasets -- TARA and WikiTilo. PuzzleGPT outperforms large VLMs such as BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, LLaVA, and even GPT-4V, as well as automatically generated reasoning pipelines like VisProg, by at least 32% and 38%, respectively. It even rivals or surpasses finetuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Lin, Shanda Li, Haotian Ye, Yiming Yang, Stefano Ermon, Yitao Liang, Jianzhu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Ye, Yongxin Zhang, Yikai Zhang, Haoyu Kuang, Zhongyu Wei, Peng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires AI agents that can not only make stratigic decisions but also engage in flexible and meaningful communication. Inspired by Wittgenstein's language game theory in Philosophical Investigations, we propose that language agents can learn through in-context interaction rather than traditional multi-stage frameworks that separate decision-making from language expression. Using Werewolf, a social deduction game that tests language understanding, strategic interaction, and adaptability, we develop the Multi-agent Kahneman & Tversky's Optimization (MaKTO). MaKTO engages diverse models in extensive gameplay to generate unpaired desirable and unacceptable responses, then employs KTO to refine the model's decision-making process. In 9-player Werewolf games, MaKTO achieves a 61% average win rate across various models, outperforming GPT-4o and two-stage RL agents by relative improvements of 23.0% and 10.9%, respectively. Notably, MaKTO also demonstrates human-like performance, winning 60% against expert players and showing only 49% detectability in Turing-style blind tests. These results showcase MaKTO's superior decision-making, strategic adaptation, and natural language generation in complex social deduction games.</p>

<p>Abstract: A mutation in the DNA of a single cell that compromises its function initiates leukemia,leading to the overproduction of immature white blood cells that encroach upon the space required for the generation of healthy blood cells.Leukemia is treatable if identified in its initial stages. However,its diagnosis is both arduous and time consuming. This study proposes a novel approach for diagnosing leukemia across four stages Benign,Early,Pre,and Pro using deep learning techniques.We employed two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models as MobileNetV2 with an altered head and a custom model. The custom model consists of multiple convolutional layers,each paired with corresponding max pooling layers.We utilized MobileNetV2 with ImageNet weights,adjusting the head to integrate the final results.The dataset used is the publicly available "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Image Dataset", and we applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to augment and balance the training dataset.The custom model achieved an accuracy of 98.6%, while MobileNetV2 attained a superior accuracy of 99.69%. The pretrained model showed promising results,indicating an increased likelihood of real-world application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14250">Siren: A Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Framework for Simulating Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhao, Youzhi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications, raising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with jailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus primarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by real-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or predefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during attacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework designed to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of three stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback (Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the attacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against Gemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a 7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that leverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing decomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack goals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against advanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhao Jiang, Chenghao Chen, Hao Feng, Yu Yang, Jin Liu, Jie Zhang, Jia Jia, Ning Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In reality, users have different interests in different periods, regions, scenes, etc. Such changes in interest are so drastic that they are difficult to be captured by recommenders. Existing multi-domain learning can alleviate this problem. However, the structure of the industrial recommendation system is complex, the amount of data is huge, and the training cost is extremely high, so it is difficult to modify the structure of the industrial recommender and re-train it. To fill this gap, we consider recommenders as large pre-trained models and fine-tune them. We first propose the theory of the information bottleneck for fine-tuning and present an explanation for the fine-tuning technique in recommenders. To tailor for recommendation, we design an information-aware adaptive kernel (IAK) technique to fine-tune the pre-trained recommender. Specifically, we define fine-tuning as two phases: knowledge compression and knowledge matching and let the training stage of IAK explicitly approximate these two phases. Our proposed approach designed from the essence of fine-tuning is well interpretable. Extensive online and offline experiments show the superiority of our proposed method. Besides, we also share unique and important lessons we learned when deploying the method in a large-scale online platform. We also present the potential issues of fine-tuning techniques in recommendation systems and the corresponding solutions. The recommender with IAK technique has been deployed on the homepage of a billion-scale online food platform for several months and has yielded considerable profits in our business.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14269">Hierarchical Time-Aware Mixture of Experts for Multi-Modal Sequential Recommendation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengzhe Zhang, Liyi Chen, Dazhong Shen, Chao Wang, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal sequential recommendation (SR) leverages multi-modal data to learn more comprehensive item features and user preferences than traditional SR methods, which has become a critical topic in both academia and industry. Existing methods typically focus on enhancing multi-modal information utility through adaptive modality fusion to capture the evolving of user preference from user-item interaction sequences. However, most of them overlook the interference caused by redundant interest-irrelevant information contained in rich multi-modal data. Additionally, they primarily rely on implicit temporal information based solely on chronological ordering, neglecting explicit temporal signals that could more effectively represent dynamic user interest over time. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical time-aware Mixture of experts for multi-modal Sequential Recommendation (HM4SR) with a two-level Mixture of Experts (MoE) and a multi-task learning strategy. Specifically, the first MoE, named Interactive MoE, extracts essential user interest-related information from the multi-modal data of each item. Then, the second MoE, termed Temporal MoE, captures user dynamic interests by introducing explicit temporal embeddings from timestamps in modality encoding. To further address data sparsity, we propose three auxiliary supervision tasks: sequence-level category prediction (CP) for item feature understanding, contrastive learning on ID (IDCL) to align sequence context with user interests, and placeholder contrastive learning (PCL) to integrate temporal information with modalities for dynamic interest modeling. Extensive experiments on four public datasets verify the effectiveness of HM4SR compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadegh Mahdavi, Muchen Li, Kaiwen Liu, Christos Thrampoulidis, Leonid Sigal, Renjie Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Liang, Xu Li, Xiaolei Chen, Haotian Chen, Yi Zheng, Chenghang Lai, Bin Li, Xiangyang Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demand for high-resolution image processing in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) grows, sub-image partitioning has become a popular approach for mitigating visual information loss associated with fixed-resolution processing. However, existing partitioning methods uniformly process sub-images, resulting in suboptimal image understanding. In this work, we reveal that the sub-images with higher semantic relevance to the entire image encapsulate richer visual information for preserving the model's visual understanding ability. Therefore, we propose the Global Semantic-guided Weight Allocator (GSWA) module, which dynamically allocates weights to sub-images based on their relative information density, emulating human visual attention mechanisms. This approach enables the model to focus on more informative regions, overcoming the limitations of uniform treatment. We integrate GSWA into the InternVL2-2B framework to create SleighVL, a lightweight yet high-performing model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SleighVL outperforms models with comparable parameters and remains competitive with larger models. Our work provides a promising direction for more efficient and contextually aware high-resolution image processing in LVLMs, advancing multimodal system development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyun Park, Dongmin Park, Jae-Gil Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables deep neural networks to adapt to ever-changing data distributions. In practice, there may be scenarios where annotation is costly, leading to active continual learning (ACL), which performs active learning (AL) for the CL scenarios when reducing the labeling cost by selecting the most informative subset is preferable. However, conventional AL strategies are not suitable for ACL, as they focus solely on learning the new knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. Therefore, ACL requires a new AL strategy that can balance the prevention of catastrophic forgetting and the ability to quickly learn new tasks. In this paper, we propose AccuACL, Accumulated informativeness-based Active Continual Learning, by the novel use of the Fisher information matrix as a criterion for sample selection, derived from a theoretical analysis of the Fisher-optimality preservation properties within the framework of ACL, while also addressing the scalability issue of Fisher information-based AL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AccuACL significantly outperforms AL baselines across various CL algorithms, increasing the average accuracy and forgetting by 23.8% and 17.0%, respectively, in average.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text, especially in short-context documents, is difficult because there is not enough context for accurate classification. This paper presents a new teacher-student model that uses domain adaptation and data augmentation to solve these problems. The teacher model, which combines DeBERTa-v3-large and Mamba-790m, learns semantic knowledge through domain-specific fine-tuning. The student model handles short-context text more efficiently. The system uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to guide the student's learning, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Also, data augmentation methods like spelling correction and error injection make the model more robust. Experimental results show that this approach works better than baseline methods, proving its usefulness for real-time AI-generated text detection and other text classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sullam Jeoung, Yubin Ge, Haohan Wang, Jana Diesner</p>
<p>Abstract: Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.
  Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calvin Yeung, Jeff Yu, King Chau Cheung, Tat Wing Wong, Chun Man Chan, Kin Chi Wong, Keisuke Fujii</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated grading has become an essential tool in education technology due to its ability to efficiently assess large volumes of student work, provide consistent and unbiased evaluations, and deliver immediate feedback to enhance learning. However, current systems face significant limitations, including the need for large datasets in few-shot learning methods, a lack of personalized and actionable feedback, and an overemphasis on benchmark performance rather than student experience. To address these challenges, we propose a Zero-Shot Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Automated Assignment Grading (AAG) system. This framework leverages prompt engineering to evaluate both computational and explanatory student responses without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The AAG system delivers tailored feedback that highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement, thereby enhancing student learning outcomes. Our study demonstrates the system's effectiveness through comprehensive evaluations, including survey responses from higher education students that indicate significant improvements in motivation, understanding, and preparedness compared to traditional grading methods. The results validate the AAG system's potential to transform educational assessment by prioritizing learning experiences and providing scalable, high-quality feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Insu Lee, Jiseob Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Byonghyo Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to identify unseen state-object compositions by leveraging knowledge learned from seen compositions. Existing approaches often independently predict states and objects, overlooking their relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, learning primitive relations (LPR), designed to probabilistically capture the relationships between states and objects. By employing the cross-attention mechanism, LPR considers the dependencies between states and objects, enabling the model to infer the likelihood of unseen compositions. Experimental results demonstrate that LPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all three CZSL benchmark datasets in both closed-world and open-world settings. Through qualitative analysis, we show that LPR leverages state-object relationships for unseen composition prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raquel Espinosa, Gracia S\'anchez, Jos\'e Palma, Fernando Jim\'enez</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in the analysis of high-dimensional data, where the number of features often vastly exceeds the number of samples. Effective feature selection not only improves model performance and interpretability but also reduces computational costs and mitigates the risk of overfitting. In this context, we propose a novel feature selection method for high-dimensional data, based on the well-known permutation feature importance approach, but extending it to evaluate subsets of attributes rather than individual features. This extension more effectively captures how interactions among features influence model performance. The proposed method employs a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to search for candidate feature subsets, with the objectives of maximizing the degradation in model performance when the selected features are shuffled, and minimizing the cardinality of the feature subset. The effectiveness of our method has been validated on a set of 24 publicly available high-dimensional datasets for classification and regression tasks, and compared against 9 well-established feature selection methods designed for high-dimensional problems, including the conventional permutation feature importance method. The results demonstrate the ability of our approach in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for feature selection in complex, high-dimensional datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Nyiri, Olivier Gibaru</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, but they have the disadvantage of not providing any information about their decision. Consequently, estimating the reasoning of the system provides additional information. For this, Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is one of the methods in eXplainable Machine Learning (XML). Its purpose is to provide contributions of any neural network output in the domain of its input. The main drawback of current methods is mainly due to division by small values. To overcome this problem, we provide a new definition called Relative LRP where the classical conservation law is satisfied up to a multiplicative factor but without divisions by small values except for Resnet skip connection. In this article, we will focus on image classification. This allows us to visualize the contributions of a pixel to the predictions of a multi-layer neural network. Pixel contributions provide a focus to further analysis on regions of potential interest. R-LRP can be applied for any dense, CNN or residual neural networks. Moreover, R-LRP doesn't need any hyperparameters to tune contrary to other LRP methods. We then compare the R-LRP method on different datasets with simple CNN, VGG16, VGG19 and Resnet50 networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshko koloski, Nada Lavra\v{c}, Bla\v{z} \v{S}krlj</p>
<p>Abstract: Construction of neural network architectures suitable for learning from both continuous and discrete tabular data is a challenging research endeavor. Contemporary high-dimensional tabular data sets are often characterized by a relatively small instance count, requiring data-efficient learning. We propose HorNets (Horn Networks), a neural network architecture with state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-life data sets from scarce-data tabular domains. HorNets are based on a clipped polynomial-like activation function, extended by a custom discrete-continuous routing mechanism that decides which part of the neural network to optimize based on the input's cardinality. By explicitly modeling parts of the feature combination space or combining whole space in a linear attention-like manner, HorNets dynamically decide which mode of operation is the most suitable for a given piece of data with no explicit supervision. This architecture is one of the few approaches that reliably retrieves logical clauses (including noisy XNOR) and achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on 14 real-life biomedical high-dimensional data sets. HorNets are made freely available under a permissive license alongside a synthetic generator of categorical benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Ma, Yifeng Xu, Yang Lin, Tianlong Wang, Xu Chu, Xin Gao, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents.

<p>Abstract: The level of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a prognostic factor for patients with (triple-negative) breast cancer (BC). Computational TIL assessment (CTA) has the potential to assist pathologists in this labour-intensive task, but current CTA models rely heavily on many detailed annotations. We propose and validate a fundamentally simpler deep learning based CTA that can be trained in only ten minutes on hundredfold fewer pathologist annotations. We collected whole slide images (WSIs) with TILs scores and clinical data of 2,340 patients with BC from six cohorts including three randomised clinical trials. Morphological features were extracted from whole slide images (WSIs) using a pathology foundation model. Our label-efficient Computational stromal TIL assessment model (ECTIL) directly regresses the TILs score from these features. ECTIL trained on only a few hundred samples (ECTIL-TCGA) showed concordance with the pathologist over five heterogeneous external cohorts (r=0.54-0.74, AUROC=0.80-0.94). Training on all slides of five cohorts (ECTIL-combined) improved results on a held-out test set (r=0.69, AUROC=0.85). Multivariable Cox regression analyses indicated that every 10% increase of ECTIL scores was associated with improved overall survival independent of clinicopathological variables (HR 0.86, p<0.01), similar to the pathologist score (HR 0.87, p<0.001). We demonstrate that ECTIL is highly concordant with an expert pathologist and obtains a similar hazard ratio. ECTIL has a fundamentally simpler design than existing methods and can be trained on orders of magnitude fewer annotations. Such a CTA may be used to pre-screen patients for, e.g., immunotherapy clinical trial inclusion, or as a tool to assist clinicians in the diagnostic work-up of patients with BC.

To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjie Wang, Jiacheng You, Yihang Hu, Jiongye Li, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world tasks such as garment manipulation and table rearrangement demand robots to perform generalizable, highly precise, and long-horizon actions. Although imitation learning has proven to be an effective approach for teaching robots new skills, large amounts of expert demonstration data are still indispensible for these complex tasks, resulting in high sample complexity and costly data collection. To address this, we propose Semantic Keypoint Imitation Learning (SKIL), a framework which automatically obtain semantic keypoints with help of vision foundation models, and forms the descriptor of semantic keypoints that enables effecient imitation learning of complex robotic tasks with significantly lower sample complexity. In real world experiments, SKIL doubles the performance of baseline methods in tasks such as picking a cup or mouse, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to variations in objects, environmental changes, and distractors. For long-horizon tasks like hanging a towel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean success rate of 70\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL naturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints abstraction, our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring considerable improvement to the learning performance. All these results demonstrate the great success of SKIL in achieving data-efficint generalizable robotic learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wu, Jia Hu, Geyong Min, Shiqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and versatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting to various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on mobile devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data leads to significant performance degradation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel Federated Adaptive Rank Allocation for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance flexibility and expressiveness, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local training time and peak memory usage in each round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms weak baselines by an average of 8.49\% and strong baselines by 6.95\% across various datasets under data heterogeneity while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40\(\times\). Moreover, experiments on AGX Orin, Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5 devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90\% and 46.95\%, respectively.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14443">Learning more with the same effort: how randomization improves the robustness of a robotic deep reinforcement learning agent</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luc\'ia G\"uitta-L\'opez, Jaime Boal, \'Alvaro J. L\'opez-L\'opez</p>
<p>Abstract: The industrial application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is frequently slowed down because of the inability to generate the experience required to train the models. Collecting data often involves considerable time and economic effort that is unaffordable in most cases. Fortunately, devices like robots can be trained with synthetic experience thanks to virtual environments. With this approach, the sample efficiency problems of artificial agents are mitigated, but another issue arises: the need for efficiently transferring the synthetic experience into the real world (sim-to-real).
  This paper analyzes the robustness of a state-of-the-art sim-to-real technique known as progressive neural networks (PNNs) and studies how adding diversity to the synthetic experience can complement it. To better understand the drivers that lead to a lack of robustness, the robotic agent is still tested in a virtual environment to ensure total control on the divergence between the simulated and real models.
  The results show that a PNN-like agent exhibits a substantial decrease in its robustness at the beginning of the real training phase. Randomizing certain variables during simulation-based training significantly mitigates this issue. On average, the increase in the model's accuracy is around 25% when diversity is introduced in the training process. This improvement can be translated into a decrease in the required real experience for the same final robustness performance. Notwithstanding, adding real experience to agents should still be beneficial regardless of the quality of the virtual experience fed into the agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Goksenin Yuksel, Jaap Kamps</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense retrievers have demonstrated significant potential for neural information retrieval; however, they exhibit a lack of robustness to domain shifts, thereby limiting their efficacy in zero-shot settings across diverse domains. Previous research has investigated unsupervised domain adaptation techniques to adapt dense retrievers to target domains. However, these studies have not focused on explainability analysis to understand how such adaptations alter the model's behavior. In this paper, we propose utilizing the integrated gradients framework to develop an interpretability method that provides both instance-based and ranking-based explanations for dense retrievers. To generate these explanations, we introduce a novel baseline that reveals both query and document attributions. This method is used to analyze the effects of domain adaptation on input attributions for query and document tokens across two datasets: the financial question answering dataset (FIQA) and the biomedical information retrieval dataset (TREC-COVID). Our visualizations reveal that domain-adapted models focus more on in-domain terminology compared to non-adapted models, exemplified by terms such as "hedge," "gold," "corona," and "disease." This research addresses how unsupervised domain adaptation techniques influence the behavior of dense retrievers when adapted to new domains. Additionally, we demonstrate that integrated gradients are a viable choice for explaining and analyzing the internal mechanisms of these opaque neural models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Duetting, Michal Feldman, Tomasz Ponitka, Ermis Soumalias</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic contract design studies scenarios where a principal incentivizes an agent to exert effort on her behalf. In this work, we focus on settings where the agent's type is drawn from an unknown distribution, and formalize an offline learning framework for learning near-optimal contracts from sample agent types. A central tool in our analysis is the notion of pseudo-dimension from statistical learning theory. Beyond its role in establishing upper bounds on the sample complexity, pseudo-dimension measures the intrinsic complexity of a class of contracts, offering a new perspective on the tradeoffs between simplicity and optimality in contract design. Our main results provide essentially optimal tradeoffs between pseudo-dimension and representation error (defined as the loss in principal's utility) with respect to linear and bounded contracts. Using these tradeoffs, we derive sample- and time-efficient learning algorithms, and demonstrate their near-optimality by providing almost matching lower bounds on the sample complexity. Conversely, for unbounded contracts, we prove an impossibility result showing that no learning algorithm exists.
  Finally, we extend our techniques in three important ways. First, we provide refined pseudo-dimension and sample complexity guarantees for the combinatorial actions model, revealing a novel connection between the number of critical values and sample complexity. Second, we extend our results to menus of contracts, showing that their pseudo-dimension scales linearly with the menu size. Third, we adapt our algorithms to the online learning setting, where we show that, a polynomial number of type samples suffice to learn near-optimal bounded contracts. Combined with prior work, this establishes a formal separation between expert advice and bandit feedback for this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Walid Yassine, Martin Charachon, C\'eline Hudelot, Roberto Ardon</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing cancer progression in liver CT scans is a clinical challenge, requiring a comparison of scans at different times for the same patient. Practitioners must identify existing tumors, compare them with prior exams, identify new tumors, and evaluate overall disease evolution. This process is particularly complex in liver examinations due to misalignment between exams caused by several factors. Indeed, longitudinal liver examinations can undergo different non-pathological and pathological changes due to non-rigid deformations, the appearance or disappearance of pathologies, and other variations. In such cases, existing registration approaches, mainly based on intrinsic features may distort tumor regions, biasing the tumor progress evaluation step and the corresponding diagnosis. This work proposes a registration method based only on geometrical and anatomical information from liver segmentation, aimed at aligning longitudinal liver images for aided diagnosis. The proposed method is trained and tested on longitudinal liver CT scans, with 317 patients for training and 53 for testing. Our experimental results support our claims by showing that our method is better than other registration techniques by providing a smoother deformation while preserving the tumor burden (total volume of tissues considered as tumor) within the volume. Qualitative results emphasize the importance of smooth deformations in preserving tumor appearance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Critiques are important for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling both self-improvement and constructive feedback for others by identifying flaws and suggesting improvements. However, evaluating the critique capabilities of LLMs presents a significant challenge due to the open-ended nature of the task. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to assess the critique capabilities of LLMs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which typically function in an open-loop fashion, our approach employs a closed-loop methodology that evaluates the quality of corrections generated from critiques. Moreover, the benchmark incorporates features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, which are crucial for distinguishing the abilities of advanced reasoning models from more classical ones. We implement this benchmark using eight challenging reasoning tasks. We have several interesting findings. First, despite demonstrating comparable performance in direct chain-of-thought generation, classical LLMs significantly lag behind the advanced reasoning-based model o1-mini across all critique scenarios. Second, in self-critique and iterative critique settings, classical LLMs may even underperform relative to their baseline capabilities. We hope that this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource to guide future advancements. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/tangzhy/RealCritic}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Using the exact gradients of the rewards to directly optimize policy parameters via backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) enables high training performance for quadrotor tasks. However, designing a fully differentiable reward architecture is often challenging. Partially differentiable rewards will result in biased gradient propagation that degrades training performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose Amended Backpropagation-through-Time (ABPT), a novel approach that mitigates gradient bias while preserving the training efficiency of BPTT. ABPT combines 0-step and N-step returns, effectively reducing the bias by leveraging value gradients from the learned Q-value function. Additionally, it adopts entropy regularization and state initialization mechanisms to encourage exploration during training. We evaluate ABPT on four representative quadrotor flight tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ABPT converges significantly faster and achieves higher ultimate rewards than existing learning algorithms, particularly in tasks involving partially differentiable rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haifeng Wen, Hong Xing, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc calibration of pre-trained models is critical for ensuring reliable inference, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a robust post-hoc calibration framework, providing distribution-free statistical coverage guarantees for prediction sets by leveraging held-out datasets. In this work, we address a decentralized setting where each device has limited calibration data and can communicate only with its neighbors over an arbitrary graph topology. We propose two message-passing-based approaches for achieving reliable inference via CP: quantile-based distributed conformal prediction (Q-DCP) and histogram-based distributed conformal prediction (H-DCP). Q-DCP employs distributed quantile regression enhanced with tailored smoothing and regularization terms to accelerate convergence, while H-DCP uses a consensus-based histogram estimation approach. Through extensive experiments, we investigate the trade-offs between hyperparameter tuning requirements, communication overhead, coverage guarantees, and prediction set sizes across different network topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamid Sarmadi, Ola Hall, Thorsteinn R\"ognvaldsson, Mattias Ohlsson</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the novel application of Large Language Models (LLMs) with vision capabilities to analyze satellite imagery for village-level poverty prediction. Although LLMs were originally designed for natural language understanding, their adaptability to multimodal tasks, including geospatial analysis, has opened new frontiers in data-driven research. By leveraging advancements in vision-enabled LLMs, we assess their ability to provide interpretable, scalable, and reliable insights into human poverty from satellite images. Using a pairwise comparison approach, we demonstrate that ChatGPT can rank satellite images based on poverty levels with accuracy comparable to domain experts. These findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of LLMs in socioeconomic research, providing a foundation for their integration into poverty assessment workflows. This study contributes to the ongoing exploration of unconventional data sources for welfare analysis and opens pathways for cost-effective, large-scale poverty monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhao Zeng, Jerry Huang, Peng Lu, Gezheng Xu, Boxing Chen, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Over recent years, the Transformer has become a fundamental building block for sequence modeling architectures. Yet at its core is the use of self-attention, whose memory and computational cost grow quadratically with the sequence length $N$, rendering it prohibitively expensive for long sequences. A promising approach is top-$k$ attention, which selects only the $k$ most relevant tokens and achieves performance comparable to vanilla self-attention while significantly reducing space and computational demands. However, causal masks require the current query token to only attend to past tokens, preventing the existing top-$k$ attention method from efficiently searching for the most relevant tokens in parallel, thereby limiting training efficiency. In this work, we propose ZETA, leveraging \textbf{Z}-Order Curves for \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{T}op-$k$ \textbf{A}ttention, to enable parallel querying of past tokens for entire sequences. % in both space and time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. We first theoretically show that the choice of key and query dimensions involves a trade-off between the curse of dimensionality and the preservation of relative distances after projection. In light of this insight, we propose reducing the dimensionality of keys and queries in contrast to values and further leverage $Z$-order curves to map low-dimensional keys and queries into \emph{one}-dimensional space, which permits parallel sorting, thereby largely improving the efficiency for top-$k$ token selection. Experimental results demonstrate that ZETA matches the performance of standard attention on the synthetic \textsc{Multi-Query Associative Recall} task and outperforms attention and its variants on \textsc{Long Range Arena} and \textsc{WikiText-103} language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sankani Sarathchandra, Eslam Eldeeb, Mohammad Shehab, Hirley Alves, Konstantin Mikhaylov, Mohamed-Slim Alouini</p>
<p>Abstract: Age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power are crucial performance metrics in low energy wireless networks, where information freshness is of paramount importance. This study examines a power-limited internet of things (IoT) network supported by a flying unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) that collects data. Our aim is to optimize the UAV flight trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize a varying AoI and transmission power combination. To tackle this variation, this paper proposes a meta-deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach that integrates deep Q-networks (DQNs) with model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). DQNs determine optimal UAV decisions, while MAML enables scalability across varying objective functions. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm converges faster and adapts to new objectives more effectively than traditional deep RL methods, achieving minimal AoI and transmission power overall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feyisayo Olalere, Kiki van der Heijden, Christiaan H. Stronks, Jeroen Briaire, Johan HM Frijns, Marcel van Gerven</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech separation approaches for single-channel, dry speech mixtures have significantly improved. However, real-world spatial and reverberant acoustic environments remain challenging, limiting the effectiveness of these approaches for assistive hearing devices like cochlear implants (CIs). To address this, we quantify the impact of real-world acoustic scenes on speech separation and explore how spatial cues can enhance separation quality efficiently. We analyze performance based on implicit spatial cues (inherent in the acoustic input and learned by the model) and explicit spatial cues (manually calculated spatial features added as auxiliary inputs). Our findings show that spatial cues (both implicit and explicit) improve separation for mixtures with spatially separated and nearby talkers. Furthermore, spatial cues enhance separation when spectral cues are ambiguous, such as when voices are similar. Explicit spatial cues are particularly beneficial when implicit spatial cues are weak. For instance, single CI microphone recordings provide weaker implicit spatial cues than bilateral CIs, but even single CIs benefit from explicit cues. These results emphasize the importance of training models on real-world data to improve generalizability in everyday listening scenarios. Additionally, our statistical analyses offer insights into how data properties influence model performance, supporting the development of efficient speech separation approaches for CIs and other assistive devices in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Vujinovic, Aleksandar Kovacevic</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning efficient representations for decision-making policies is a challenge in imitation learning (IL). Current IL methods require expert demonstrations, which are expensive to collect. Consequently, they often have underdeveloped world models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an alternative by allowing models to learn from diverse, unlabeled data, including failures. However, SSL methods often operate in raw input space, making them inefficient. In this work, we propose ACT-JEPA, a novel architecture that integrates IL and SSL to enhance policy representations. We train a policy to predict (1) action sequences and (2) abstract observation sequences. The first objective uses action chunking to improve action prediction and reduce compounding errors. The second objective extends this idea of chunking by predicting abstract observation sequences. We utilize Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture to predict in abstract representation space, allowing the model to filter out irrelevant details, improve efficiency, and develop a robust world model. Our experiments show that ACT-JEPA improves the quality of representations by learning temporal environment dynamics. Additionally, the model's ability to predict abstract observation sequences results in representations that effectively generalize to action sequence prediction. ACT-JEPA performs on par with established baselines across a range of decision-making tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelo Rodio, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized learning enables distributed agents to train a shared machine learning model through local computation and peer-to-peer communication. Although each agent retains its dataset locally, the communication of local models can still expose private information to adversaries. To mitigate these threats, local differential privacy (LDP) injects independent noise per agent, but it suffers a larger utility gap than central differential privacy (CDP). We introduce Whisper D-SGD, a novel covariance-based approach that generates correlated privacy noise across agents, unifying several state-of-the-art methods as special cases. By leveraging network topology and mixing weights, Whisper D-SGD optimizes the noise covariance to achieve network-wide noise cancellation. Experimental results show that Whisper D-SGD cancels more noise than existing pairwise-correlation schemes, substantially narrowing the CDP-LDP gap and improving model performance under the same privacy guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trong-Binh Nguyen, Minh-Duong Nguyen, Jinsun Park, Quoc-Viet Pham, Won Joo Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to learn from multiple known source domains a model that can generalize well to unknown target domains. One of the key approaches in DG is training an encoder which generates domain-invariant representations. However, this approach is not applicable in Federated Domain Generalization (FDG), where data from various domains are distributed across different clients. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, dubbed Federated Learning via On-server Matching Gradient (FedOMG), which can \emph{efficiently leverage domain information from distributed domains}. Specifically, we utilize the local gradients as information about the distributed models to find an invariant gradient direction across all domains through gradient inner product maximization. The advantages are two-fold: 1) FedOMG can aggregate the characteristics of distributed models on the centralized server without incurring any additional communication cost, and 2) FedOMG is orthogonal to many existing FL/FDG methods, allowing for additional performance improvements by being seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experimental evaluations on various settings to demonstrate the robustness of FedOMG compared to other FL/FDG baselines. Our method outperforms recent SOTA baselines on four FL benchmark datasets (MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100), and three FDG benchmark datasets (PACS, VLCS, and OfficeHome).</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongzhi Zhang, Junhao Zheng, Zhiping Peng, Qianli Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Recently, a line of message-passing-based research has been proposed to solve CQA. However, they perform unsatisfactorily on negative queries and fail to address the noisy messages between variable nodes in the query graph. Moreover, they offer little interpretability and require complex query data and resource-intensive training. In this paper, we propose a Neural-Symbolic Message Passing (NSMP) framework based on pre-trained neural link predictors. By introducing symbolic reasoning and fuzzy logic, NSMP can generalize to arbitrary existential first order logic queries without requiring training while providing interpretable answers. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy to filter out noisy messages between variable nodes. Experimental results show that NSMP achieves a strong performance. Additionally, through complexity analysis and empirical verification, we demonstrate the superiority of NSMP in inference time over the current state-of-the-art neural-symbolic method. Compared to this approach, NSMP demonstrates faster inference times across all query types on benchmark datasets, with speedup ranging from 2$\times$ to over 150$\times$.</p>

Recently, researchers have focused on advancing methods to improve state-of-the-art results in low-resource settings. Motivated by these advancements, we propose the MPoincareSum method. This method applies the Mamba state space model to generate the semantics of reviews and sentences, which are then concatenated. A Poincare compression is used to select the most meaningful features, followed by the application of a linear layer to predict sentence relevance based on the corresponding review. Finally, we paraphrase the relevant sentences to create the final summary. To evaluate the effectiveness of MPoincareSum, we conducted extensive experiments using the Amazon review dataset. The performance of the method was assessed using ROUGE scores. The experimental results demonstrate that MPoincareSum outperforms several existing approaches in the literature</p>

<p>Abstract: Precise and real-time estimation of the robotic arm's position on the patient's side is essential for the success of remote robotic surgery in Tactile Internet (TI) environments. This paper presents a prediction model based on the Transformer-based Informer framework for accurate and efficient position estimation. Additionally, it combines a Four-State Hidden Markov Model (4-State HMM) to simulate realistic packet loss scenarios. The proposed approach addresses challenges such as network delays, jitter, and packet loss to ensure reliable and precise operation in remote surgical applications. The method integrates the optimization problem into the Informer model by embedding constraints such as energy efficiency, smoothness, and robustness into its training process using a differentiable optimization layer. The Informer framework uses features such as ProbSparse attention, attention distilling, and a generative-style decoder to focus on position-critical features while maintaining a low computational complexity of O(L log L). The method is evaluated using the JIGSAWS dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 90 percent under various network scenarios. A comparison with models such as TCN, RNN, and LSTM demonstrates the Informer framework's superior performance in handling position prediction and meeting real-time requirements, making it suitable for Tactile Internet-enabled robotic surgery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attention-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in modelling long-range dependencies on spherical cortical surfaces, surpassing traditional Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) models. However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Rongzhao-He/surface-vision-mamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simran Ketha, Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Overparameterized Deep Neural Networks that generalize well have been key to the dramatic success of Deep Learning in recent years. The reasons for their remarkable ability to generalize are not well understood yet. It has also been known that deep networks possess the ability to memorize training data, as evidenced by perfect or high training accuracies on models trained with corrupted data that have class labels shuffled to varying degrees. Concomitantly, such models are known to generalize poorly, i.e. they suffer from poor test accuracies, due to which it is thought that the act of memorizing substantially degrades the ability to generalize. It has, however, been unclear why the poor generalization that accompanies such memorization, comes about. One possibility is that in the process of training with corrupted data, the layers of the network irretrievably reorganize their representations in a manner that makes generalization difficult. The other possibility is that the network retains significant ability to generalize, but the trained network somehow chooses to readout in a manner that is detrimental to generalization. Here, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating, empirically, that such models possess information in their representations for substantially improved generalization, even in the face of memorization. Furthermore, such generalization abilities can be easily decoded from the internals of the trained model, and we build a technique to do so from the outputs of specific layers of the network. We demonstrate results on multiple models trained with a number of standard datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and reveal significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the existing table instruction-tuning works, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong Li, Yuhang Wang, Matthijs van Leeuwen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm that exploits supervisory signals generated from the data itself, and many recent studies have leveraged SSL to conduct graph anomaly detection. However, we empirically found that three important factors can substantially impact detection performance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the tuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination weights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection methods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by label information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and combination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance, using label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage and leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been criticized as "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", yet many recent studies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information to select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an internal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select hyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection. We perform extensive experiments using 10 recent SSL-based graph anomaly detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating both the prior issues with hyperparameter selection and the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilya Orson Sandoval, Isaac Symes Thompson, Vasilios Mavroudis, Chris Hicks</p>
<p>Abstract: As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent, self-improving defensive systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information. To address this gap, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment that encodes the observable network state as a directed graph, utilizing realistic and interpretable low-level features. %, like number of open ports and unexpected detected connections. We leverage a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and modify its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. GAT policies offer several advantages over standard approaches based on simplistic flattened state observations. They can handle the changes in network topology that occur at runtime when dynamic connections between hosts appear. Policies can be deployed to networks that differ in size to the ones seen during training, enabling a degree of generalisation inaccessible with alternative approaches. Furthermore, the graph neural network policies outputs are explainable in terms of tangible network properties, providing enhanced interpretability of defensive actions. We verify that our low-level graph observations are meaningful enough to train GAT defensive policies that are able to adapt to changing topologies. We evaluate how our trained policies perform when deployed on networks of varying sizes with the same subnetwork structure, comparing them against policies specifically trained for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ipek Baris Schlicht, Zhixue Zhao, Burcu Sayin, Lucie Flek, Paolo Rosso</p>
<p>Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital for public health, but the quality of online health resources varies by language, raising concerns about inconsistencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare. In this study, we examine the consistency of responses provided by LLMs to health-related questions across English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. We largely expand the HealthFC dataset by categorizing health-related questions by disease type and broadening its multilingual scope with Turkish and Chinese translations. We reveal significant inconsistencies in responses that could spread healthcare misinformation. Our main contributions are 1) a multilingual health-related inquiry dataset with meta-information on disease categories, and 2) a novel prompt-based evaluation workflow that enables sub-dimensional comparisons between two languages through parsing. Our findings highlight key challenges in deploying LLM-based tools in multilingual contexts and emphasize the need for improved cross-lingual alignment to ensure accurate and equitable healthcare information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Zha, Jiaan Wang, Zhixu Li, Xiangru Zhu, Wei Song, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal knowledge bases (MMKBs) provide cross-modal aligned knowledge crucial for multimodal tasks. However, the images in existing MMKBs are generally collected for entities in encyclopedia knowledge graphs. Therefore, detailed groundings of visual semantics with linguistic concepts are lacking, which are essential for the visual concept cognition ability of multimodal models. Addressing this gap, we introduce M^2ConceptBase, the first concept-centric MMKB. M^2ConceptBase models concepts as nodes with associated images and detailed textual descriptions. We propose a context-aware multimodal symbol grounding approach to align concept-image and concept-description pairs using context information from image-text datasets. Comprising 951K images and 152K concepts, M^2ConceptBase links each concept to an average of 6.27 images and a single description, ensuring comprehensive visual and textual semantics. Human studies confirm more than 95% alignment accuracy, underscoring its quality. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that M^2ConceptBase significantly enhances VQA model performance on the OK-VQA task. M^2ConceptBase also substantially improves the fine-grained concept understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models through retrieval augmentation in two concept-related tasks, highlighting its value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo C. T. Bezerra, Alexander E. I. Brownlee, Luana Ferraz Alvarenga, Renan Cipriano Moioli, Thais Vasconcelos Batista</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has driven many information and communication technology (ICT) breakthroughs. Nonetheless, the scope of ICT systems has expanded far beyond AI since the Turing test proposal. Critically, recent AI regulation proposals adopt AI definitions affecting ICT techniques, approaches, and systems that are not AI. In some cases, even works from mathematics, statistics, and engineering would be affected. Worryingly, AI misdefinitions are observed from Western societies to the Global South. In this paper, we propose a framework to score how validated as appropriately-defined for regulation (VADER) an AI definition is. Our online, publicly-available VADER framework scores the coverage of premises that should underlie AI definitions for regulation, which aim to (i) reproduce principles observed in other successful technology regulations, and (ii) include all AI techniques and approaches while excluding non-AI works. Regarding the latter, our score is based on a dataset of representative AI, non-AI ICT, and non-ICT examples. We demonstrate our contribution by reviewing the AI regulation proposals of key players, namely the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Brazil. Importantly, none of the proposals assessed achieve the appropriateness score, ranging from a revision need to a concrete risk to ICT systems and works from other fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongye Xiao, Chenyu Zhou, Heng Ping, Defu Cao, Yaxing Li, Yi-Zhuo Zhou, Shixuan Li, Nikos Kanakaris, Paul Bogdan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing attention on the capabilities of large models, particularly in handling complex tasks that small-scale models are unable to perform. Notably, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated ``intelligent'' abilities such as complex reasoning and abstract language comprehension, reflecting cognitive-like behaviors. However, current research on emergent abilities in large models predominantly focuses on the relationship between model performance and size, leaving a significant gap in the systematic quantitative analysis of the internal structures and mechanisms driving these emergent abilities. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience research on brain network structure and self-organization, we propose (i) a general network representation of large models, (ii) a new analytical framework, called Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis (NeuroMFA), for structural analysis, and (iii) a novel structure-based metric as a proxy for emergent abilities of large models. By linking structural features to the capabilities of large models, NeuroMFA provides a quantitative framework for analyzing emergent phenomena in large models. Our experiments show that the proposed method yields a comprehensive measure of network's evolving heterogeneity and organization, offering theoretical foundations and a new perspective for investigating emergent abilities in large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasaman Etesam, Hyunmin Cheong, Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI has made remarkable progress in addressing various design challenges. One prominent area where generative AI could bring significant value is in engineering design. In particular, selecting an optimal set of components and their interfaces to create a mechanical system that meets design requirements is one of the most challenging and time-consuming tasks for engineers. This configuration design task is inherently challenging due to its categorical nature, multiple design requirements a solution must satisfy, and the reliance on physics simulations for evaluating potential solutions. These characteristics entail solving a combinatorial optimization problem with multiple constraints involving black-box functions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep generative model to predict the optimal combination of components and interfaces for a given design problem. To demonstrate our approach, we solve a gear train synthesis problem by first creating a synthetic dataset using a grammar, a parts catalogue, and a physics simulator. We then train a Transformer using this dataset, named GearFormer, which can not only generate quality solutions on its own, but also augment search methods such as an evolutionary algorithm and Monte Carlo tree search. We show that GearFormer outperforms such search methods on their own in terms of satisfying the specified design requirements with orders of magnitude faster generation time. Additionally, we showcase the benefit of hybrid methods that leverage both GearFormer and search methods, which further improve the quality of the solutions.</p>

Recent advances in Constraint Programming (CP) and Temporal Networks have reinvoked interest in evaluating the advantages and drawbacks of various proactive and reactive scheduling methods.

Our statistical analysis shows that the STNU-based algorithm performs best in terms of solution quality, while also showing good relative offline and online computation time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowei Jiang, Liang Ou, Yanan Chen, Na Ao, Yu-Cheng Chang, Thomas Do, Chin-Teng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research. The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity. This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange. The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingjia Shen, Hao Wang, Chuhan Wu, Jin Yao Chin, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Huifeng Guo, Defu Lian, Ruiming Tang, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling Laws have emerged as a powerful framework for understanding how model performance evolves as they increase in size, providing valuable insights for optimizing computational resources. In the realm of Sequential Recommendation (SR), which is pivotal for predicting users' sequential preferences, these laws offer a lens through which to address the challenges posed by the scalability of SR models. However, the presence of structural and collaborative issues in recommender systems prevents the direct application of the Scaling Law (SL) in these systems. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models, which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship between model performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCG metrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approach compared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accurate predictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating a strong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achieving optimal performance for any given model configuration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanxiang Hu, Qiyu Li, Anze Xie, Nan Jiang, Ion Stoica, Haojian Jin, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions. With the burst of capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D, etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger by the day. However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities. In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless. We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.). Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key components of Eliza's runtime.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Schumacher, Markus Strohmaier, Florian Lemmerich</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years. However, a comprehensive empirical comparison of quantification methods that supports algorithm selection is not available yet. In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on overall more than 40 data sets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods including the threshold selection-based Median Sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman's mixture model, and Friedman's method that performs best in the binary setting. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the Generalized Probabilistic Adjusted Count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman's method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance. More generally, we find that the performance on multiclass quantification is inferior to the results obtained in the binary setting. Our results can guide practitioners who intend to apply quantification algorithms and help researchers to identify opportunities for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umang Bhatt, Valerie Chen, Katherine M. Collins, Parameswaran Kamalaruban, Emma Kallina, Adrian Weller, Ameet Talwalkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Individual human decision-makers may benefit from different forms of support to improve decision outcomes, but when each form of support will yield better outcomes? In this work, we posit that personalizing access to decision support tools can be an effective mechanism for instantiating the appropriate use of AI assistance. Specifically, we propose the general problem of learning a decision support policy that, for a given input, chooses which form of support to provide to decision-makers for whom we initially have no prior information. We develop $\texttt{Modiste}$, an interactive tool to learn personalized decision support policies. $\texttt{Modiste}$ leverages stochastic contextual bandit techniques to personalize a decision support policy for each decision-maker and supports extensions to the multi-objective setting to account for auxiliary objectives like the cost of support. We find that personalized policies outperform offline policies, and, in the cost-aware setting, reduce the incurred cost with minimal degradation to performance. Our experiments include various realistic forms of support (e.g., expert consensus and predictions from a large language model) on vision and language tasks. Our human subject experiments validate our computational experiments, demonstrating that personalization can yield benefits in practice for real users, who interact with $\texttt{Modiste}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian B\"other, Ties Robroek, Viktor Gsteiger, Robin Holzinger, Xianzhe Ma, P{\i}nar T\"oz\"un, Ana Klimovic</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines, datasets are continuously growing. Models must incorporate this new training data to improve generalization and adapt to potential distribution shifts. The cost of model retraining is proportional to how frequently the model is retrained and how much data it is trained on, which makes the naive approach of retraining from scratch each time impractical.
  We present Modyn, a data-centric end-to-end machine learning platform. Modyn's ML pipeline abstraction enables users to declaratively describe policies for continuously training a model on a growing dataset. Modyn pipelines allow users to apply data selection policies (to reduce the number of data points) and triggering policies (to reduce the number of trainings). Modyn executes and orchestrates these continuous ML training pipelines. The system is open-source and comes with an ecosystem of benchmark datasets, models, and tooling. We formally discuss how to measure the performance of ML pipelines by introducing the concept of composite models, enabling fair comparison of pipelines with different data selection and triggering policies. We empirically analyze how various data selection and triggering policies impact model accuracy, and also show that Modyn enables high throughput training with sample-level data selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread success of deep learning, its intense requirements for vast amounts of data and extensive training make it impractical for various real-world applications where data is scarce. In recent years, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has emerged as a learning paradigm that aims to address these limitations by leveraging prior knowledge to enable rapid adaptation to novel learning tasks. Due to its properties that highly complement deep learning's data-intensive needs, FSL has seen significant growth in the past few years. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of both well-established methods as well as recent advancements in the FSL field. The presented taxonomy extends previously proposed ones by incorporating emerging FSL paradigms, such as in-context learning, along with novel categories within the meta-learning paradigm for FSL, including neural processes and probabilistic meta-learning. Furthermore, a holistic overview of FSL is provided by discussing hybrid FSL approaches that extend FSL beyond the typically examined supervised learning setting. The survey also explores FSL's diverse applications across various domains. Finally, recent trends shaping the field, outstanding challenges, and promising future research directions are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: We employ an audit design to investigate biases in state-of-the-art large language models, including GPT-4. In our study, we prompt the models for advice involving a named individual across a variety of scenarios, such as during car purchase negotiations or election outcome predictions. We find that the advice systematically disadvantages names that are commonly associated with racial minorities and women. Names associated with Black women receive the least advantageous outcomes. The biases are consistent across 42 prompt templates and several models, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents. While providing numerical, decision-relevant anchors in the prompt can successfully counteract the biases, qualitative details have inconsistent effects and may even increase disparities. Our findings underscore the importance of conducting audits at the point of LLM deployment and implementation to mitigate their potential for harm against marginalized communities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has exhibited substantial success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). For example large language models have empirically proven to be capable of producing text of high complexity and cohesion. However, they are prone to inaccuracies and hallucinations. As these systems are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their safety and reliability becomes a primary concern. There are safety critical contexts where such models must be robust to variability or attack, and give guarantees over their output. Computer Vision had pioneered the use of formal verification of neural networks for such scenarios and developed common verification standards and pipelines, leveraging precise formal reasoning about geometric properties of data manifolds. In contrast, NLP verification methods have only recently appeared in the literature. While presenting sophisticated algorithms, these papers have not yet crystallised into a common methodology. They are often light on the pragmatical issues of NLP verification and the area remains fragmented. In this paper, we attempt to distil and evaluate general components of an NLP verification pipeline, that emerges from the progress in the field to date. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we propose a general methodology to analyse the effect of the embedding gap, a problem that refers to the discrepancy between verification of geometric subspaces and the semantic meaning of sentences, which the geometric subspaces are supposed to represent. We propose a number of practical NLP methods that can help to quantify the effects of the embedding gap. Secondly, we give a general method for training and verification of neural networks that leverages a more precise geometric estimation of semantic similarity of sentences in the embedding space and helps to overcome the effects of the embedding gap in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Shmakov, Kevin Greif, Michael James Fenton, Aishik Ghosh, Pierre Baldi, Daniel Whiteson</p>
<p>Abstract: The measurements performed by particle physics experiments must account for the imperfect response of the detectors used to observe the interactions. One approach, unfolding, statistically adjusts the experimental data for detector effects. Recently, generative machine learning models have shown promise for performing unbinned unfolding in a high number of dimensions. However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces. The performance of this method is evaluated in the context of semi-leptonic top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoming Li, Jian Yang, Shangsong Liang, Dongsheng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks are proposed to harness spectral information inherent in graph-structured data through the application of polynomial-defined graph filters, recently achieving notable success in graph-based web applications. Existing studies reveal that various polynomial choices greatly impact spectral GNN performance, underscoring the importance of polynomial selection. However, this selection process remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Although prior work suggests a connection between the approximation capabilities of polynomials and the efficacy of spectral GNNs, there is a lack of theoretical insights into this relationship, rendering polynomial selection a largely heuristic process.
  To address the issue, this paper examines polynomial selection from an error-sum of function slices perspective. Inspired by the conventional signal decomposition, we represent graph filters as a sum of disjoint function slices. Building on this, we then bridge the polynomial capability and spectral GNN efficacy by proving that the construction error of graph convolution layer is bounded by the sum of polynomial approximation errors on function slices. This result leads us to develop an advanced filter based on trigonometric polynomials, a widely adopted option for approximating narrow signal slices. The proposed filter remains provable parameter efficiency, with a novel Taylor-based parameter decomposition that achieves streamlined, effective implementation. With this foundation, we propose TFGNN, a scalable spectral GNN operating in a decoupled paradigm. We validate the efficacy of TFGNN via benchmark node classification tasks, along with an example graph anomaly detection application to show its practical utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Generative Models (DGMs) can learn flexible latent variable representations of images while avoiding intractable computations, common in Bayesian inference. However, investigating the properties of inference in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a major class of DGMs, reveals severe problems in their uncertainty representations. Here we draw inspiration from classical computer vision to introduce an inductive bias into the VAE by incorporating a global explaining-away latent variable, which remedies defective inference in VAEs. Unlike standard VAEs, the Explaing-Away VAE (EA-VAE) provides uncertainty estimates that align with normative requirements across a wide spectrum of perceptual tasks, including image corruption, interpolation, and out-of-distribution detection. We find that restored inference capabilities are delivered by developing a motif in the inference network (the encoder) which is widespread in biological neural networks: divisive normalization. Our results establish EA-VAEs as reliable tools to perform inference under deep generative models with appropriate estimates of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has favoured major languages such as English, leaving a significant gap for many others due to limited resources. This is especially evident in the context of data annotation, a task whose importance cannot be underestimated, but which is time-consuming and costly. Thus, any dataset for resource-poor languages is precious, in particular when it is task-specific. Here, we explore the feasibility of repurposing an existing multilingual dataset for a new NLP task: we repurpose a subset of the BELEBELE dataset (Bandarkar et al., 2023), which was designed for multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), to enable the more practical task of extractive QA (EQA) in the style of machine reading comprehension. We present annotation guidelines and a parallel EQA dataset for English and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We also present QA evaluation results for several monolingual and cross-lingual QA pairs including English, MSA, and five Arabic dialects. We aim to help others adapt our approach for the remaining 120 BELEBELE language variants, many of which are deemed under-resourced. We also provide a thorough analysis and share insights to deepen understanding of the challenges and opportunities in NLP task reformulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungho Jeon, Xinyue Ma, Kwang In Kim, Myeongjae Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent rehearsal-free methods, guided by prompts, generally excel in vision-related continual learning (CL) scenarios with continuously drifting data. To be deployable on real-world devices, these methods must contain high resource efficiency during training. In this paper, we introduce Resource-Efficient Prompting (REP), which targets improving the resource efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free methods. Our key focus is on avoiding catastrophic trade-offs with accuracy while trimming computational and memory costs during prompt learning. We achieve this by exploiting swift prompt selection that enhances input data using a carefully provisioned model, and by developing adaptive token merging (AToM) and layer dropping (ALD) algorithms for the prompt updating stage. AToM and ALD perform selective skipping across the data and model dimensions without compromising task-specific features while learning new tasks. We validate REP's superior resource efficiency over current state-of-the-art ViT- and CNN-based methods through extensive experiments on three image classification datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Sahu, Olga Vechtomova, Issam H. Laradji</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches for low-resource text summarization primarily employ large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4 at inference time to generate summaries directly; however, such approaches often suffer from inconsistent LLM outputs and are difficult to adapt to domain-specific data in low-resource scenarios. In this work, we propose two novel methods to effectively utilize LLMs for low-resource text summarization: 1) MixSumm, an LLM-based data augmentation regime that synthesizes high-quality documents (short and long) for few-shot text summarization, and 2) PPSL, a prompt-based pseudolabeling strategy for sample-efficient semi-supervised text summarization. Specifically, MixSumm leverages the open-source LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate new documents by mixing topical information derived from a small seed set, and PPSL leverages the LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a semi-supervised learning setup. We evaluate our methods on the TweetSumm, WikiHow, and ArXiv/PubMed datasets and use L-Eval, a LLaMA-3-based evaluation metric, and ROUGE scores to measure the quality of generated summaries. Our experiments on extractive and abstractive summarization show that MixSumm and PPSL achieve competitive ROUGE scores as a fully supervised method with 5% of the labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqing Yang, Hanbin Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Xinze Li, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Yu Gu, Minghe Yu, Zhiyuan Liu, Ge Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Code debugging is a vital stage of software development, essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation task. Human debugging typically follows a multi-stage process, which includes Bug Localization, Bug Identification, Code Repair, and Code Recognition. However, existing code debugging benchmarks predominantly focus on the Code Repair stage, which offers only a limited perspective on evaluating the debugging capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the debugging abilities of LLMs by emulating the multi-stage human debugging process. Through evaluating on DEBUGEVAL, we observe that 7B-scale models consistently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, highlighting their limitations in comprehending code semantics. In this case, we propose the COmmunicative Agent-based data SynThesis (COAST) framework, which employs a multi-agent system to generate high-quality training data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that COAST-generated data outperform human-curated and GPT-4-generated data, enabling 7B-scale LLMs to achieve debugging performance comparable to GPT-3.5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Sun, Yongpan Sheng, Lirong He, Yongbin Qin, Ming Liu, Tao Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention for its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby enriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs. Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative Causal Enhanced Graph Representation Learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing the performance of the TKGR task. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal knowledge graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglin Wang, Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Yiwei Li, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (PTC) posits that the development of cognitive levels forms the foundation for human learning across various abilities. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable abilities across a wide variety of tasks, we are curious about the cognitive levels of current LLMs: to what extent they have developed and how this development has been achieved. To this end, we construct a benchmark CogLM (Cognitive Ability Evaluation for Language Model) based on PTC to assess the cognitive levels of LLMs. CogLM comprises 1,220 questions spanning 10 cognitive abilities crafted by more than 20 human experts, providing a comprehensive testbed for the cognitive levels of LLMs. Through extensive experiments across multiple mainstream LLMs with CogLM, we find that: (1) Human-like cognitive abilities have emerged in advanced LLMs (GPT-4), comparable to those of a 20-year-old human. (2) The parameter size and optimization objective are two key factors affecting the cognitive levels of LLMs. (3) The performance on downstream tasks is positively correlated with the level of cognitive abilities. These findings fill the gap in research on the cognitive abilities of LLMs, tracing the development of LLMs from a cognitive perspective and guiding the future direction of their evolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Wei, Anees Abrol, Vince Calhoun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning structured state space models, especially the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements while maintaining linear complexity. In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture component-level and network-level information. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. We further show brain connectivities and dynamics that are crucial for the prediction. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglin Wang, Shaoxiong Feng, Yiwei Li, Peiwen Yuan, Yueqi Zhang, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-consistency (SC), a widely used decoding strategy for chain-of-thought reasoning, shows significant gains across various multi-step reasoning tasks but comes with a high cost due to multiple sampling with the preset size. Its variants, Adaptive self-consistency (ASC) and Early-stopping self-consistency (ESC), dynamically adjust the number of samples based on the posterior distribution of a set of pre-samples, reducing the cost of SC with minimal impact on performance. Both methods, however, do not exploit the prior information about question difficulty. It often results in unnecessary repeated sampling for easy questions that could be accurately answered with just one attempt, wasting resources. To tackle this problem, we propose Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC), which leverages the difficulty information from both prior and posterior perspectives to adaptively allocate inference resources, further reducing the cost of SC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DSC, we conduct extensive experiments on three popular categories of reasoning tasks: arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning on six benchmarks. The empirical results show that DSC consistently surpasses the strong baseline ASC and ESC in terms of costs by a significant margin, while attaining comparable performances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mehdi Rastikerdar, Jin Huang, Hui Guan, Deepak Ganesan</p>
<p>Abstract: Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models for inference tasks in remote environments. However, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Through extensive evaluation on multiple camera trap deployments, we demonstrate that WildFit significantly improves accuracy while greatly reducing adaptation overhead compared to traditional approaches.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639">Moral Alignment for LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizaveta Tennant, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Yang, Peng Chen, Zhihui Lu, Ruijun Deng, Qiang Duan, Jianping Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Graph Neural Network (FedGNN) integrate federated learning (FL) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enable privacy-preserving training on distributed graph data. Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network (VFGNN), a key branch of FedGNN, handles scenarios where data features and labels are distributed among participants. Despite the robust privacy-preserving design of VFGNN, we have found that it still faces the risk of backdoor attacks, even in situations where labels are inaccessible. This paper proposes BVG, a novel backdoor attack method that leverages multi-hop triggers and backdoor retention, requiring only four target-class nodes to execute effective attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that BVG achieves nearly 100% attack success rates across three commonly used datasets and three GNN models, with minimal impact on the main task accuracy. We also evaluated various defense methods, and the BVG method maintained high attack effectiveness even under existing defenses. This finding highlights the need for advanced defense mechanisms to counter sophisticated backdoor attacks in practical VFGNN applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmood Hegazy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language generation but often confidently produce incorrect responses, especially in tasks like mathematical reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting, self-verification, and multi-agent debate are among the strategies proposed to improve the reasoning and factual accuracy of LLMs. Building on Du et al.'s multi-agent debate framework, we find that multi-agent debate helps at any model scale, and that diversity of thought elicits stronger reasoning in debating LLMs. Across various model sizes, performance on mathematical reasoning tasks benefits most when diverse trained models are used. Remarkably, after 4 rounds of debate, a diverse set of medium-capacity models (Gemini-Pro, Mixtral 7BX8, and PaLM 2-M) outperforms GPT-4 on the GSM-8K benchmark, scoring 91% accuracy. By comparison, when 3 instances of Gemini-Pro are used, performance only reaches 82%. Finally, this diverse set of medium-capacity models sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the ASDiv benchmark (94%). These results underscore the idea that the future of AI is agentic, with diverse cooperating agents yielding emergent capabilities beyond even the most powerful individual models.</p>

<p>Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in global applications, the importance of cultural sensitivity becomes paramount, ensuring that users from diverse backgrounds feel respected and understood. Cultural harm can arise when these models fail to align with specific cultural norms, resulting in misrepresentations or violations of cultural values. This work addresses the challenges of ensuring cultural sensitivity in LLMs, especially in small-parameter models that often lack the extensive training data needed to capture global cultural nuances. We present two key contributions: (1) A cultural harm test dataset, created to assess model outputs across different cultural contexts through scenarios that expose potential cultural insensitivities, and (2) A culturally aligned preference dataset, aimed at restoring cultural sensitivity through fine-tuning based on feedback from diverse annotators. These datasets facilitate the evaluation and enhancement of LLMs, ensuring their ethical and safe deployment across different cultural landscapes. Our results show that integrating culturally aligned feedback leads to a marked improvement in model behavior, significantly reducing the likelihood of generating culturally insensitive or harmful content. Ultimately, this work paves the way for more inclusive and respectful AI systems, fostering a future where LLMs can safely and ethically navigate the complexities of diverse cultural landscapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikael Rinkinen, Lauri Koskinen, Olli Silven, Mehdi Safarpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Reduced voltage operation is an effective technique for substantial energy efficiency improvement in digital circuits. This brief introduces a simple approach for enabling reduced voltage operation of Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators by mere software modifications. Conventional approaches for enabling reduced voltage operation e.g., Timing Error Detection (TED) systems, incur significant development costs and overheads, while not being applicable to the off-the-shelf components. Contrary to those, the solution proposed in this paper relies on algorithm-based error detection, and hence, is implemented with low development costs, does not require any circuit modifications, and is even applicable to commodity devices. By showcasing the solution through experimenting on popular DNNs, i.e., LeNet and VGG16, on a GPU platform, we demonstrate 18% to 25% energy saving with no accuracy loss of the models and negligible throughput compromise (< 3.9%), considering the overheads from integration of the error detection schemes into the DNN. The integration of presented algorithmic solution into the design is simpler when compared conventional TED based techniques that require extensive circuit-level modifications, cell library characterizations or special support from the design tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent self-supervised clustering-based pre-training techniques like DINO and Cribo have shown impressive results for downstream detection and segmentation tasks. However, real-world applications such as autonomous driving face challenges with imbalanced object class and size distributions and complex scene geometries. In this paper, we propose S3PT a novel scene semantics and structure guided clustering to provide more scene-consistent objectives for self-supervised training. Specifically, our contributions are threefold: First, we incorporate semantic distribution consistent clustering to encourage better representation of rare classes such as motorcycles or animals. Second, we introduce object diversity consistent spatial clustering, to handle imbalanced and diverse object sizes, ranging from large background areas to small objects such as pedestrians and traffic signs. Third, we propose a depth-guided spatial clustering to regularize learning based on geometric information of the scene, thus further refining region separation on the feature level. Our learned representations significantly improve performance in downstream semantic segmentation and 3D object detection tasks on the nuScenes, nuImages, and Cityscapes datasets and show promising domain translation properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiologists have preferred visual impressions or 'styles' of X-ray images that are manually adjusted to their needs to support their diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose an automatic and interpretable X-ray style transfer by introducing a trainable version of the Local Laplacian Filter (LLF). From the shape of the LLF's optimized remap function, the characteristics of the style transfer can be inferred and reliability of the algorithm can be ensured. Moreover, we enable the LLF to capture complex X-ray style features by replacing the remap function with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and adding a trainable normalization layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by transforming unprocessed mammographic X-ray images into images that match the style of target mammograms and achieve a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.94 compared to 0.82 of the baseline LLF style transfer method from Aubry et al.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Teacher2Task, a novel framework for multi-teacher learning that eliminates the need for manual aggregation heuristics. Existing multi-teacher methods typically rely on such heuristics to combine predictions from multiple teachers, often resulting in sub-optimal aggregated labels and the propagation of aggregation errors. Teacher2Task addresses these limitations by introducing teacher-specific input tokens and reformulating the training process. Instead of relying on aggregated labels, the framework transforms the training data, consisting of ground truth labels and annotations from N teachers, into N+1 distinct tasks: N auxiliary tasks that predict the labeling styles of the N individual teachers, and one primary task that focuses on the ground truth labels. This approach, drawing upon principles from multiple learning paradigms, demonstrates strong empirical results across a range of architectures, modalities, and tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxin Liu, Xiang Gao, Yisha Li, Xin Li, Haiyang Lu, Ben Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement, thus improving dwelling time and improving user retention. In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to inject at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream injection policy for accurate live stream allocation. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, and these issues may cause too many live stream allocation, which interrupts user's short video interest and leads to a decrease in the user's app usage duration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the platform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aman Tiwari, Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay, Vikas Yadav, Masoud Hashemi, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph databases like Neo4j are gaining popularity for handling complex, interconnected data, over traditional relational databases in modeling and querying relationships. While translating natural language into SQL queries is well-researched, generating Cypher queries for Neo4j remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we present an automated, LLM-Supervised, pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data for Text2Cypher. Our Cypher data generation pipeline introduces LLM-As-Database-Filler, a novel strategy for ensuring Cypher query correctness, thus resulting in high quality generations. Using our pipeline, we generate high quality Text2Cypher data - SynthCypher containing 29.8k instances across various domains and queries with varying complexities. Training open-source LLMs like LLaMa-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and QWEN-7B on SynthCypher results in performance gains of up to 40% on the Text2Cypher test split and 30% on the SPIDER benchmark, adapted for graph databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Thompson, Nuno Saavedra, Pedro Carrott, Kevin Fisher, Alex Sanchez-Stern, Yuriy Brun, Jo\~ao F. Ferreira, Sorin Lerner, Emily First</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq, enables the creation of high-quality software. However, the verification process requires significant expertise and manual effort to write proofs. Recent work has explored automating proof synthesis using machine learning and large language models (LLMs). This work has shown that identifying relevant premises, such as lemmas and definitions, can aid synthesis. We present Rango, a fully automated proof synthesis tool for Coq that automatically identifies relevant premises and also similar proofs from the current project and uses them during synthesis. Rango uses retrieval augmentation at every step of the proof to automatically determine which proofs and premises to include in the context of its fine-tuned LLM. In this way, Rango adapts to the project and to the evolving state of the proof. We create a new dataset, CoqStoq, of 2,226 open-source Coq projects and 196,929 theorems from GitHub, which includes both training data and a curated evaluation benchmark of well-maintained projects. On this benchmark, Rango synthesizes proofs for 32.0% of the theorems, which is 29% more theorems than the prior state-of-the-art tool Tactician. Our evaluation also shows that Rango adding relevant proofs to its context leads to a 47% increase in the number of theorems proven.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Ahnaf Akib, Md. Muktadir Mazumder, Salman Ahsan</p>
<p>Abstract: Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions for source code. Deep learning has been used more and more recently in software engineering, particularly for tasks like code creation and summarization. Specifically, it appears that the most current Large Language Models with coding perform well on these tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of code summarization, providing sophisticated methods for generating concise and accurate summaries of source code. This study aims to perform a comparative analysis of several open-source LLMs, namely LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Gemma. These models' performance is assessed using important metrics such as BLEU\textsubscript{3.1} and ROUGE\textsubscript{3.2}.
  Through this analysis, we seek to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model, offering insights into their applicability and effectiveness in code summarization tasks. Our findings contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of LLMs, supporting their integration into tools that enhance software development and maintenance processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laypeople -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.
  To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewhan Kim, Soeun Lee, Si-Woo Kim, Dong-Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent lightweight image captioning models using retrieved data mainly focus on text prompts. However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPCap significantly outperforms prior lightweight captioning models in efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for a plug-and-play solution.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06252">Transformer-Squared: Self-adaptive LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Sun, Edoardo Cetin, Yujin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are often computationally intensive and static in their ability to handle diverse tasks. We introduce Transformer-Squared, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, Transformer-Squared employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific 'expert' vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method consistently outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. Furthermore, Transformer-Squared demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. Transformer-Squared represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liping Yuan, Jiawei Wang, Haomiao Sun, Yuchen Zhang, Yuan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Tarsier2, a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) designed for generating detailed and accurate video descriptions, while also exhibiting superior general video understanding capabilities. Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8% over GPT-4o and 5.8% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Salezze Vieira, Eduardo Machado Silva, Antonio Augusto Chaves</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient surgery room scheduling is essential for hospital efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource utilization. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel concept of Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), rigorously tested on literature and new, real-world inspired instances. Our combinatorial optimization problem incorporates multi-room scheduling, equipment scheduling, and complex availability constraints for rooms, patients, and surgeons, facilitating rescheduling and enhancing operational flexibility. The RKO approach represents solutions as points in a continuous space, which are then mapped in the problem solution space via a deterministic function known as a decoder. The core idea is to operate metaheuristics and heuristics in the random-key space, unaware of the original solution space. We design the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with $Q$-Learning, Simulated Annealing, and Iterated Local Search for use within an RKO framework, employing a single decoder function. The proposed metaheuristics are complemented by lower-bound formulations, providing optimal gaps for evaluating the effectiveness of the heuristic results. Our results demonstrate significant lower and upper bounds improvements for the literature instances, notably proving one optimal result. Furthermore, the best-proposed metaheuristic efficiently generates schedules for the newly introduced instances, even in highly constrained scenarios. This research offers valuable insights and practical solutions for improving surgery scheduling processes, offering tangible benefits to hospitals by optimising resource allocation, reducing patient wait times, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordi Montes Sanabria, Pol Alvarez Vecino</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models has fundamentally transformed the capabilities of AI agents, enabling a new class of autonomous agents capable of interacting with their environment through dynamic code generation and execution. These agents possess the theoretical capacity to operate as independent economic actors within digital markets, offering unprecedented potential for value creation through their distinct advantages in operational continuity, perfect replication, and distributed learning capabilities. However, contemporary digital infrastructure, architected primarily for human interaction, presents significant barriers to their participation.
  This work presents a systematic analysis of the infrastructure requirements necessary for AI agents to function as autonomous participants in digital markets. We examine four key areas - identity and authorization, service discovery, interfaces, and payment systems - to show how existing infrastructure actively impedes agent participation. We argue that addressing these infrastructure challenges represents more than a technical imperative; it constitutes a fundamental step toward enabling new forms of economic organization. Much as traditional markets enable human intelligence to coordinate complex activities beyond individual capability, markets incorporating AI agents could dramatically enhance economic efficiency through continuous operation, perfect information sharing, and rapid adaptation to changing conditions. The infrastructure challenges identified in this work represent key barriers to realizing this potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liu, Zhenchao Ma, Zepu Wang, Yang Liu, Zehua Wang, Peng Sun, Liang Song, Bo Hu, Azzedine Boukerche, Victor C. M. Leung</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Held, Bhargavi Paranjape, Punit Singh Koura, Mike Lewis, Frank Zhang, Todor Mihaylov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models improve with increasing amounts of high-quality training data. However, leveraging larger datasets requires balancing quality, quantity, and diversity across sources. After evaluating nine baseline methods under both compute- and data-constrained scenarios, we find token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes, indicating that simple approaches accounting for dataset size and diversity are surprisingly effective. Building on this insight, we propose two complementary approaches: UtiliMax, which extends token-based heuristics by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations, achieving up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines; and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which leverages LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples, matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by $\sim$200x. Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shixuan Song, Hao Chen, Shu Hu, Xin Wang, Jinrong Hu, Xi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a highly challenging task, often categorized as a one-class classification and segmentation problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Evaluated on the MVTec AD dataset, PFADSeg achieves state-of-the-art results with an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Liu, Kai Wang, Senmao Li, Joost van de Weijer, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Shiqi Yang, Yaxing Wang, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation models can create high-quality images from input prompts. However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of language models, coined context consistency, to comprehend identity through context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent context consistency, we propose a novel training-free method for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed "One-Prompt-One-Story" (1Prompt1Story). Our approach 1Prompt1Story concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the generation process using two novel techniques: Singular-Value Reweighting and Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention, ensuring better alignment with the input description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.
