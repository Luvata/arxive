<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgio Franceschelli, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are revolutionizing several areas, including artificial creativity. However, the process of generation in machines profoundly diverges from that observed in humans. In particular, machine generation is characterized by a lack of intentionality and an underlying creative process. We propose a method called Creative Beam Search that uses Diverse Beam Search and LLM-as-a-Judge to perform response generation and response validation. The results of a qualitative experiment show how our approach can provide better output than standard sampling techniques. We also show that the response validation step is a necessary complement to the response generation step.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Beverley, Peter M. Koch, David Limbaugh, Barry Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: In our daily lives, as in science and in all other domains, we encounter huge numbers of dispositions (tendencies, potentials, powers) which are realized in processes such as sneezing, sweating, shedding dandruff, and on and on. Among this plethora of what we can think of as mere dispositions is a subset of dispositions in whose realizations we have an interest a car responding well when driven on ice, a rabbits lungs responding well when it is chased by a wolf, and so on. We call the latter capabilities and we attempt to provide a robust ontological account of what capabilities are that is of sufficient generality to serve a variety of purposes, for example by providing a useful extension to ontology-based research in areas where capabilities data are currently being collected in siloed fashion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Beverley, Robin McGill, Sam Smith, Jie Zheng, Giacomo De Colle, Finn Wilson, Matthew Diller, William D. Duncan, William R. Hogan, Yongqun He</p>
<p>Abstract: The term credential encompasses educational certificates, degrees, certifications, and government-issued licenses. An occupational credential is a verification of an individuals qualification or competence issued by a third party with relevant authority. Job seekers often leverage such credentials as evidence that desired qualifications are satisfied by their holders. Many U.S. education and workforce development organizations have recognized the importance of credentials for employment and the challenges of understanding the value of credentials. In this study, we identified and ontologically defined credential and credential-related terms at the textual and semantic levels based on the Occupation Ontology (OccO), a BFO-based ontology. Different credential types and their authorization logic are modeled. We additionally defined a high-level hierarchy of credential related terms and relations among many terms, which were initiated in concert with the Alabama Talent Triad (ATT) program, which aims to connect learners, earners, employers and education/training providers through credentials and skills. To our knowledge, our research provides for the first time systematic ontological modeling of the important domain of credentials and related contents, supporting enhanced credential data and knowledge integration in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Nunn, Marco S\"alzer, Fran\c{c}ois Schwarzentruber, Nicolas Troquard</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a modal logic in which counting modalities appear in linear inequalities. We show that each formula can be transformed into an equivalent graph neural network (GNN). We also show that a broad class of GNNs can be transformed efficiently into a formula, thus significantly improving upon the literature about the logical expressiveness of GNNs. We also show that the satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. These results bring together the promise of using standard logical methods for reasoning about GNNs and their properties, particularly in applications such as GNN querying, equivalence checking, etc. We prove that such natural problems can be solved in polynomial space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanwoo Park, Mingyang Liu, Kaiqing Zhang, Asuman Ozdaglar</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been an effective technique for aligning AI systems with human values, with remarkable successes in fine-tuning large-language models recently. Most existing RLHF paradigms make the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively homogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human preferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing feedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous human feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and aggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on representation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple reward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and variance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by personalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both approaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as already deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse and truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward and preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both utilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models, with sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human feedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the probabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle strategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences with untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach ensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule maximizing social welfare functions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00285">iMTSP: Solving Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Imperative Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Guo, Zhongqiang Ren, Chen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers a Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP), where the goal is to find a set of tours, one for each agent, to collectively visit all the cities while minimizing the length of the longest tour. Though MTSP has been widely studied, obtaining near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems is still challenging due to its NP-hardness. Recent efforts in data-driven methods face challenges of the need for hard-to-obtain supervision and issues with high variance in gradient estimations, leading to slow convergence and highly suboptimal solutions. We address these issues by reformulating MTSP as a bilevel optimization problem, using the concept of imperative learning (IL). This involves introducing an allocation network that decomposes the MTSP into multiple single-agent traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The longest tour from these TSP solutions is then used to self-supervise the allocation network, resulting in a new self-supervised, bilevel, end-to-end learning framework, which we refer to as imperative MTSP (iMTSP). Additionally, to tackle the high-variance gradient issues during the optimization, we introduce a control variate-based gradient estimation algorithm. Our experiments showed that these innovative designs enable our gradient estimator to converge 20% faster than the advanced reinforcement learning baseline and find up to 80% shorter tour length compared with Google OR-Tools MTSP solver, especially in large-scale problems (e.g. 1000 cities and 15 agents).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00352">Transformer-based Reasoning for Learning Evolutionary Chain of Events on Temporal Knowledge Graph</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Fang, Shuai-Long Lei, Xiaobin Zhu, Chun Yang, Shi-Xue Zhang, Xu-Cheng Yin, Jingyan Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning often involves completing missing factual elements along the timeline. Although existing methods can learn good embeddings for each factual element in quadruples by integrating temporal information, they often fail to infer the evolution of temporal facts. This is mainly because of (1) insufficiently exploring the internal structure and semantic relationships within individual quadruples and (2) inadequately learning a unified representation of the contextual and temporal correlations among different quadruples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer-based reasoning model (dubbed ECEformer) for TKG to learn the Evolutionary Chain of Events (ECE). Specifically, we unfold the neighborhood subgraph of an entity node in chronological order, forming an evolutionary chain of events as the input for our model. Subsequently, we utilize a Transformer encoder to learn the embeddings of intra-quadruples for ECE. We then craft a mixed-context reasoning module based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the unified representations of inter-quadruples for ECE while accomplishing temporal knowledge reasoning. In addition, to enhance the timeliness of the events, we devise an additional time prediction task to complete effective temporal information within the learned unified representation. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets verify the state-of-the-art performance and the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00358">Arbitrary Time Information Modeling via Polynomial Approximation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Fang, Jingyan Qin, Xiaobin Zhu, Chun Yang, Xu-Cheng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Distinguished from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) must explore and reason over temporally evolving facts adequately. However, existing TKG approaches still face two main challenges, i.e., the limited capability to model arbitrary timestamps continuously and the lack of rich inference patterns under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose an innovative TKGE method (PTBox) via polynomial decomposition-based temporal representation and box embedding-based entity representation to tackle the above-mentioned problems. Specifically, we decompose time information by polynomials and then enhance the model's capability to represent arbitrary timestamps flexibly by incorporating the learnable temporal basis tensor. In addition, we model every entity as a hyperrectangle box and define each relation as a transformation on the head and tail entity boxes. The entity boxes can capture complex geometric structures and learn robust representations, improving the model's inductive capability for rich inference patterns. Theoretically, our PTBox can encode arbitrary time information or even unseen timestamps while capturing rich inference patterns and higher-arity relations of the knowledge base. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00451">Monte Carlo Tree Search Boosts Reasoning via Iterative Preference Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Xie, Anirudh Goyal, Wenyue Zheng, Min-Yen Kan, Timothy P. Lillicrap, Kenji Kawaguchi, Michael Shieh</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an approach aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through an iterative preference learning process inspired by the successful strategy employed by AlphaZero. Our work leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively collect preference data, utilizing its look-ahead ability to break down instance-level rewards into more granular step-level signals. To enhance consistency in intermediate steps, we combine outcome validation and stepwise self-evaluation, continually updating the quality assessment of newly generated data. The proposed algorithm employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to update the LLM policy using this newly generated step-level preference data. Theoretical analysis reveals the critical importance of using on-policy sampled data for successful self-improving. Extensive evaluations on various arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over existing models. For instance, our approach outperforms the Mistral-7B Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baseline on GSM8K, MATH, and SciQ, with substantial percentage increases in accuracy to $80.7\%$ (+$4.8\%$), $32.2\%$ (+$3.3\%$), and $88.5\%$ (+$7.7\%$), respectively. Additionally, our research delves into the training and inference compute tradeoff, providing insights into how our method effectively maximizes performance gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Zhang, Yashar Moshfeghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing the challenge of automated geometry math problem-solving in artificial intelligence (AI) involves understanding multi-modal information and mathematics. Current methods struggle with accurately interpreting geometry diagrams, which hinders effective problem-solving. To tackle this issue, we present the Geometry problem sOlver with natural Language Description (GOLD) model. GOLD enhances the extraction of geometric relations by separately processing symbols and geometric primitives within the diagram. Subsequently, it converts the extracted relations into natural language descriptions, efficiently utilizing large language models to solve geometry math problems. Experiments show that the GOLD model outperforms the Geoformer model, the previous best method on the UniGeo dataset, by achieving accuracy improvements of 12.7% and 42.1% in calculation and proving subsets. Additionally, it surpasses the former best model on the PGPS9K and Geometry3K datasets, PGPSNet, by obtaining accuracy enhancements of 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile van Krieken, Samy Badreddine, Robin Manhaeve, Eleonora Giunchiglia</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy), which combines learning and reasoning, has recently experienced significant growth. There now are a wide variety of NeSy frameworks, each with its own specific language for expressing background knowledge and how to relate it to neural networks. This heterogeneity hinders accessibility for newcomers and makes comparing different NeSy frameworks challenging. We propose a unified language for NeSy, which we call ULLER, a Unified Language for LEarning and Reasoning. ULLER encompasses a wide variety of settings, while ensuring that knowledge described in it can be used in existing NeSy systems. ULLER has a neuro-symbolic first-order syntax for which we provide example semantics including classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics. We believe ULLER is a first step towards making NeSy research more accessible and comparable, paving the way for libraries that streamline training and evaluation across a multitude of semantics, knowledge bases, and NeSy systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert J. Moss, Arec Jamgochian, Johannes Fischer, Anthony Corso, Mykel J. Kochenderfer</p>
<p>Abstract: To plan safely in uncertain environments, agents must balance utility with safety constraints. Safe planning problems can be modeled as a chance-constrained partially observable Markov decision process (CC-POMDP) and solutions often use expensive rollouts or heuristics to estimate the optimal value and action-selection policy. This work introduces the ConstrainedZero policy iteration algorithm that solves CC-POMDPs in belief space by learning neural network approximations of the optimal value and policy with an additional network head that estimates the failure probability given a belief. This failure probability guides safe action selection during online Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). To avoid overemphasizing search based on the failure estimates, we introduce $\Delta$-MCTS, which uses adaptive conformal inference to update the failure threshold during planning. The approach is tested on a safety-critical POMDP benchmark, an aircraft collision avoidance system, and the sustainability problem of safe CO$_2$ storage. Results show that by separating safety constraints from the objective we can achieve a target level of safety without optimizing the balance between rewards and costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjoong Kim, Sangwu Park, Yeonjun In, Seokwon Han, Chanyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, interpreting complex charts with logical reasoning have emerged as challenges due to the development of vision-language models. A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, Deplot, has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt addressing the shortcoming of recent SOTA model, ignoring visual attributes such as color.

<p>Abstract: This research addresses the pressing challenge of enhancing processing times and detection capabilities in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)/drone imagery for global wildfire detection, despite limited datasets. Proposing a Segmented Neural Network (SegNet) selection approach, we focus on reducing feature maps to boost both time resolution and accuracy significantly advancing processing speeds and accuracy in real-time wildfire detection. This paper contributes to increased processing speeds enabling real-time detection capabilities for wildfire, increased detection accuracy of wildfire, and improved detection capabilities of early wildfire, through proposing a new direction for image classification of amorphous objects like fire, water, smoke, etc. Employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, emphasizing on the reduction of irrelevant features vital for deep learning processes, especially in live feed data for fire detection. Amidst the complexity of live feed data in fire detection, our study emphasizes on image feed, highlighting the urgency to enhance real-time processing. Our proposed algorithm combats feature overload through segmentation, addressing challenges arising from diverse features like objects, colors, and textures. Notably, a delicate balance of feature map size and dataset adequacy is pivotal. Several research papers use smaller image sizes, compromising feature richness which necessitating a new approach. We illuminate the critical role of pixel density in retaining essential details, especially for early wildfire detection. By carefully selecting number of filters during training, we underscore the significance of higher pixel density for proper feature selection. The proposed SegNet approach is rigorously evaluated using real-world dataset obtained by a drone flight and compared to state-of-the-art literature.</p>

The battery is a key component that determines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an appropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust inspections. In this context, this paper presents a novel hybrid probabilistic approach for battery end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage prediction of Li-Po batteries. The hybridization is achieved in an error-correction configuration, which combines physics-based discharge and probabilistic error-correction models to quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of the hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset comprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained from real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore wind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different probabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in probabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method. In addition, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties provide robust estimations to enhance the diagnosis of battery health-states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingrui Ma, Lansheng Han, Chunjie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Webshell, as the "culprit" behind numerous network attacks, is one of the research hotspots in the field of cybersecurity. However, the complexity, stealthiness, and confusing nature of webshells pose significant challenges to the corresponding detection schemes. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, researchers have started to apply different intelligent algorithms and neural network architectures to the task of webshell detection. However, the related research still lacks a systematic and standardized methodological process, which is confusing and redundant. Therefore, following the development timeline, we carefully summarize the progress of relevant research in this field, dividing it into three stages: Start Stage, Initial Development Stage, and In-depth Development Stage. We further elaborate on the main characteristics and core algorithms of each stage. In addition, we analyze the pain points and challenges that still exist in this field and predict the future development trend of this field from our point of view. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that details the research related to AI-based webshell detection. It is also hoped that this paper can provide detailed technical information for more researchers interested in AI-based webshell detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nisha Pillai, Bindu Nanduri, Michael J Rothrock Jr., Zhiqian Chen, Mahalingam Ramkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic microbiomes offer new possibilities for modulating microbiota, to address the barriers in multidtug resistance (MDR) research. We present a Bayesian optimization approach to enable efficient searching over the space of synthetic microbiome variants to identify candidates predictive of reduced MDR. Microbiome datasets were encoded into a low-dimensional latent space using autoencoders. Sampling from this space allowed generation of synthetic microbiome signatures. Bayesian optimization was then implemented to select variants for biological screening to maximize identification of designs with restricted MDR pathogens based on minimal samples. Four acquisition functions were evaluated: expected improvement, upper confidence bound, Thompson sampling, and probability of improvement. Based on each strategy, synthetic samples were prioritized according to their MDR detection. Expected improvement, upper confidence bound, and probability of improvement consistently produced synthetic microbiome candidates with significantly fewer searches than Thompson sampling. By combining deep latent space mapping and Bayesian learning for efficient guided screening, this study demonstrated the feasibility of creating bespoke synthetic microbiomes with customized MDR profiles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Letoffe, Xuanxiang Huang, Joao Marques-Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work uncovered examples of classifiers for which SHAP scores yield misleading feature attributions. While such examples might be perceived as suggesting the inadequacy of Shapley values for explainability, this paper shows that the source of the identified shortcomings of SHAP scores resides elsewhere. Concretely, the paper makes the case that the failings of SHAP scores result from the characteristic functions used in earlier works. Furthermore, the paper identifies a number of properties that characteristic functions ought to respect, and proposes several novel characteristic functions, each exhibiting one or more of the desired properties. More importantly, some of the characteristic functions proposed in this paper are guaranteed not to exhibit any of the shortcomings uncovered by earlier work. The paper also investigates the impact of the new characteristic functions on the complexity of computing SHAP scores. Finally, the paper proposes modifications to the tool SHAP to use instead one of our novel characteristic functions, thereby eliminating some of the limitations reported for SHAP scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Engelmann, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds tremendous potential in medicine, but is traditionally limited by the lack of massive datasets to train models on. Foundation models, pre-trained models that can be adapted to downstream tasks with small datasets, could alleviate this problem. Researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) proposed RETFound-MEH, a foundation model for retinal imaging that was trained on 900,000 images, including private hospital data. Recently, data-efficient DERETFound was proposed that provides comparable performance while being trained on only 150,000 images that are all publicly available. However, both these models required very substantial resources to train initially and are resource-intensive in downstream use. We propose a novel Token Reconstruction objective that we use to train RETFound-Green, a retinal foundation model trained using only 75,000 publicly available images and 400 times less compute. We estimate the cost of training RETFound-MEH and DERETFound at $10,000 and $14,000, respectively, while RETFound-Green could be trained for less than $100, with equally reduced environmental impact. RETFound-Green is also far more efficient in downstream use: it can be downloaded 14 times faster, computes vector embeddings 2.7 times faster which then require 2.6 times less storage space. Despite this, RETFound-Green does not perform systematically worse. In fact, it performs best on 14 tasks, compared to six for DERETFound and two for RETFound-MEH. Our results suggest that RETFound-Green is a very efficient, high-performance retinal foundation model. We anticipate that our Token Reconstruction objective could be scaled up for even higher performance and be applied to other domains beyond retinal imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Goya van Boven, Yupei Du, Dong Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Gender-neutral pronouns are increasingly being introduced across Western languages. Recent evaluations have however demonstrated that English NLP systems are unable to correctly process gender-neutral pronouns, with the risk of erasing and misgendering non-binary individuals. This paper examines a Dutch coreference resolution system's performance on gender-neutral pronouns, specifically hen and die. In Dutch, these pronouns were only introduced in 2016, compared to the longstanding existence of singular they in English. We additionally compare two debiasing techniques for coreference resolution systems in non-binary contexts: Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and delexicalisation. Moreover, because pronoun performance can be hard to interpret from a general evaluation metric like LEA, we introduce an innovative evaluation metric, the pronoun score, which directly represents the portion of correctly processed pronouns. Our results reveal diminished performance on gender-neutral pronouns compared to gendered counterparts. Nevertheless, although delexicalisation fails to yield improvements, CDA substantially reduces the performance gap between gendered and gender-neutral pronouns. We further show that CDA remains effective in low-resource settings, in which a limited set of debiasing documents is used. This efficacy extends to previously unseen neopronouns, which are currently infrequently used but may gain popularity in the future, underscoring the viability of effective debiasing with minimal resources and low computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Skylar Chan, Pranav Kulkarni, Paul H. Yi, Vishwa S. Parekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential for improving the multi-label classification of rare, albeit critical, diseases in large-scale chest x-ray (CXR) datasets due to theoretical quantum advantages over classical machine learning (CML) in sample efficiency and generalizability. While prior literature has explored QML with CXRs, it has focused on binary classification tasks with small datasets due to limited access to quantum hardware and computationally expensive simulations. To that end, we implemented a Jax-based framework that enables the simulation of medium-sized qubit architectures with significant improvements in wall-clock time over current software offerings. We evaluated the performance of our Jax-based framework in terms of efficiency and performance for hybrid quantum transfer learning for long-tailed classification across 8, 14, and 19 disease labels using large-scale CXR datasets. The Jax-based framework resulted in up to a 58% and 95% speed-up compared to PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations, respectively. However, compared to CML, QML demonstrated slower convergence and an average AUROC of 0.70, 0.73, and 0.74 for the classification of 8, 14, and 19 CXR disease labels. In comparison, the CML models had an average AUROC of 0.77, 0.78, and 0.80 respectively. In conclusion, our work presents an accessible implementation of hybrid quantum transfer learning for long-tailed CXR classification with a computationally efficient Jax-based framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pharmacometric models are pivotal across drug discovery and development, playing a decisive role in determining the progression of candidate molecules. However, the derivation of mathematical equations governing the system is a labor-intensive trial-and-error process, often constrained by tight timelines. In this study, we introduce PKINNs, a novel purely data-driven pharmacokinetic-informed neural network model. PKINNs efficiently discovers and models intrinsic multi-compartment-based pharmacometric structures, reliably forecasting their derivatives. The resulting models are both interpretable and explainable through Symbolic Regression methods. Our computational framework demonstrates the potential for closed-form model discovery in pharmacometric applications, addressing the labor-intensive nature of traditional model derivation. With the increasing availability of large datasets, this framework holds the potential to significantly enhance model-informed drug discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to automatically comprehend unusual occurrences in videos, thereby enabling various applications such as traffic surveillance and industrial manufacturing. While existing VAU benchmarks primarily concentrate on anomaly detection and localization, our focus is on more practicality, prompting us to raise the following crucial questions: "what anomaly occurred?", "why did it happen?", and "how severe is this abnormal event?". In pursuit of these answers, we present a comprehensive benchmark for Causation Understanding of Video Anomaly (CUVA). Specifically, each instance of the proposed benchmark involves three sets of human annotations to indicate the "what", "why" and "how" of an anomaly, including 1) anomaly type, start and end times, and event descriptions, 2) natural language explanations for the cause of an anomaly, and 3) free text reflecting the effect of the abnormality. In addition, we also introduce MMEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to better align with human preferences for CUVA, facilitating the measurement of existing LLMs in comprehending the underlying cause and corresponding effect of video anomalies. Finally, we propose a novel prompt-based method that can serve as a baseline approach for the challenging CUVA. We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of our evaluation metric and the prompt-based approach. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/fesvhtr/CUVA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Catto, Nan Jia, Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi, Anita Raja</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing value imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for many machine learning problems. However, it is often considered as a separate subtask from downstream applications such as classification, regression, or clustering, and thus is not optimized together with them. We hypothesize that treating the imputation model and downstream task model together and optimizing over full pipelines will yield better results than treating them separately. Our work describes a novel AutoML technique for making downstream predictions with missing data that automatically handles preprocessing, model weighting, and selection during inference time, with minimal compute overhead. Specifically we develop M-DEW, a Dynamic missingness-aware Ensemble Weighting (DEW) approach, that constructs a set of two-stage imputation-prediction pipelines, trains each component separately, and dynamically calculates a set of pipeline weights for each sample during inference time. We thus extend previous work on dynamic ensemble weighting to handle missing data at the level of full imputation-prediction pipelines, improving performance and calibration on downstream machine learning tasks over standard model averaging techniques. M-DEW is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art in that it produces statistically significant reductions in model perplexity in 17 out of 18 experiments, while improving average precision in 13 out of 18 experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samir Arora, Liangliang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Full fine-tuning is a popular approach to adapt Transformer-based pre-trained large language models to a specific downstream task. However, the substantial requirements for computational power and storage have discouraged its widespread use. Moreover, increasing evidence of catastrophic forgetting and overparameterization in the Transformer architecture has motivated researchers to seek more efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. Commonly known parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and BitFit are typically applied across all layers of the model. We propose a PEFT method, called Stratified Progressive Adaptation Fine-tuning (SPAFIT), based on the localization of different types of linguistic knowledge to specific layers of the model. Our experiments, conducted on nine tasks from the GLUE benchmark, show that our proposed SPAFIT method outperforms other PEFT methods while fine-tuning only a fraction of the parameters adjusted by other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many of the recent capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs) arise primarily from their ability to exploit contextual information. In this paper, we explore ways to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs through (1) exploration of different chains of thought and (2) validation of the individual steps of the reasoning process. We propose three general principles that a model should adhere to while reasoning: (i) Relevance, (ii) Mathematical Accuracy, and (iii) Logical Consistency. We apply these constraints to the reasoning steps generated by the LLM to improve the accuracy of the final generation. The constraints are applied in the form of verifiers: the model itself is asked to verify if the generated steps satisfy each constraint. To further steer the generations towards high-quality solutions, we use the perplexity of the reasoning steps as an additional verifier. We evaluate our method on 4 distinct types of reasoning tasks, spanning a total of 9 different datasets. Experiments show that our method is always better than vanilla generation, and, in 6 out of the 9 datasets, it is better than best-of N sampling which samples N reasoning chains and picks the lowest perplexity generation.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00218">Constrained Decoding for Secure Code Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjun Fu, Ethan Baker, Yizheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have been increasingly used by developers to boost productivity, but they often generate vulnerable code. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that code generated by Code LLMs is correct and secure. Previous research has primarily focused on generating secure code, overlooking the fact that secure code also needs to be correct. This oversight can lead to a false sense of security. Currently, the community lacks a method to measure actual progress in this area, and we need solutions that address both security and correctness of code generation.
  This paper introduces a new benchmark, CodeGuard+, along with two new metrics, secure-pass@k and secure@$k_{\text{pass}}$, to measure Code LLMs' ability to generate both secure and correct code. Using our new evaluation methods, we show that the state-of-the-art defense technique, prefix tuning, may not be as strong as previously believed, since it generates secure code but sacrifices functional correctness. We also demonstrate that different decoding methods significantly affect the security of Code LLMs.
  Furthermore, we explore a new defense direction: constrained decoding for secure code generation. We propose new constrained decoding techniques to generate code that satisfies security and correctness constraints simultaneously. Our results reveal that constrained decoding is more effective than prefix tuning to improve the security of Code LLMs, without requiring a specialized training dataset. Moreover, constrained decoding can be used together with prefix tuning to further improve the security of Code LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohe Liu, Xuenan Xu, Yi Yuan, Mengyue Wu, Wenwu Wang, Mark D. Plumbley</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modelling techniques to audio data. However, traditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such as speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language modelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel codec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second across diverse audio types, including speech, general audio, and music, without compromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a semantic encoder using a self-supervised AudioMAE, discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and an acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic encoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based decoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25, 50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31 kbps and 1.43 kbps. Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction quality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly richer semantic information than all evaluated audio codecs, even at significantly lower bitrates. Our code and demos are available at https://haoheliu.github.io/SemantiCodec/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tracking objects in three-dimensional space is critical for autonomous driving. To ensure safety while driving, the tracker must be able to reliably track objects across frames and accurately estimate their states such as velocity and acceleration in the present. Existing works frequently focus on the association task while either neglecting the model performance on state estimation or deploying complex heuristics to predict the states. In this paper, we propose STT, a Stateful Tracking model built with Transformers, that can consistently track objects in the scenes while also predicting their states accurately. STT consumes rich appearance, geometry, and motion signals through long term history of detections and is jointly optimized for both data association and state estimation tasks. Since the standard tracking metrics like MOTA and MOTP do not capture the combined performance of the two tasks in the wider spectrum of object states, we extend them with new metrics called S-MOTA and MOTPS that address this limitation. STT achieves competitive real-time performance on the Waymo Open Dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end driving models trained by imitation learning can lead to affordable solutions for autonomous driving. However, training these well-performing models usually requires a huge amount of data, while still lacking explicit and intuitive activation maps to reveal the inner workings of these models while driving. In this paper, we study how to guide the attention of these models to improve their driving quality and obtain more intuitive activation maps by adding a loss term during training using salient semantic maps. In contrast to previous work, our method does not require these salient semantic maps to be available during testing time, as well as removing the need to modify the model's architecture to which it is applied. We perform tests using perfect and noisy salient semantic maps with encouraging results in both, the latter of which is inspired by possible errors encountered with real data. Using CIL++ as a representative state-of-the-art model and the CARLA simulator with its standard benchmarks, we conduct experiments that show the effectiveness of our method in training better autonomous driving models, especially when data and computational resources are scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) using deep learning technologies can now generate high quality one-to-many voices and thus has been used in some practical application fields, such as entertainment and healthcare. However, voice conversion can pose potential social issues when manipulated voices are employed for deceptive purposes. Moreover, it is a big challenge to find who are real speakers from the converted voices as the acoustic characteristics of source speakers are changed greatly. In this paper we attempt to explore the feasibility of identifying authentic speakers from converted voices. This study is conducted with the assumption that certain information from the source speakers persists, even when their voices undergo conversion into different target voices. Therefore our experiments are geared towards recognising the source speakers given the converted voices, which are generated by using FragmentVC on the randomly paired utterances from source and target speakers. To improve the robustness against converted voices, our recognition model is constructed by using hierarchical vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) in deep neural networks. The authentic speaker recognition system is mainly tested in two aspects, including the impact of quality of converted voices and the variations of VLAD. The dataset used in this work is VCTK corpus, where source and target speakers are randomly paired. The results obtained on the converted utterances show promising performances in recognising authentic speakers from converted voices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingzhi Li, Junyu Liu, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating & reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Xiao, Chunan Shi, Xiaonan Nie, Fan Yang, Xiangwei Deng, Lei Su, Weipeng Chen, Bin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from low efficiency as the mismatch between the requirement of auto-regressive decoding and the design of most contemporary GPUs. Specifically, billions to trillions of parameters must be loaded to the GPU cache through its limited memory bandwidth for computation, but only a small batch of tokens is actually computed. Consequently, the GPU spends most of its time on memory transfer instead of computation. Recently, parallel decoding, a type of speculative decoding algorithms, is becoming more popular and has demonstrated impressive efficiency improvement in generation. It introduces extra decoding heads to large models, enabling them to predict multiple subsequent tokens simultaneously and verify these candidate continuations in a single decoding step. However, this approach deviates from the training objective of next token prediction used during pre-training, resulting in a low hit rate for candidate tokens. In this paper, we propose a new speculative decoding algorithm, Clover, which integrates sequential knowledge into the parallel decoding process. This enhancement improves the hit rate of speculators and thus boosts the overall efficiency. Clover transmits the sequential knowledge from pre-speculated tokens via the Regressive Connection, then employs an Attention Decoder to integrate these speculated tokens. Additionally, Clover incorporates an Augmenting Block that modifies the hidden states to better align with the purpose of speculative generation rather than next token prediction. The experiment results demonstrate that Clover outperforms the baseline by up to 91% on Baichuan-Small and 146% on Baichuan-Large, respectively, and exceeds the performance of the previously top-performing method, Medusa, by up to 37% on Baichuan-Small and 57% on Baichuan-Large, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anran Hu, Junzi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning for multi-agent games has attracted lots of attention recently. However, given the challenge of solving Nash equilibria for large population games, existing works with guaranteed polynomial complexities either focus on variants of zero-sum and potential games, or aim at solving (coarse) correlated equilibria, or require access to simulators, or rely on certain assumptions that are hard to verify. This work proposes MF-OML (Mean-Field Occupation-Measure Learning), an online mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of large population sequential symmetric games. MF-OML is the first fully polynomial multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for provably solving Nash equilibria (up to mean-field approximation gaps that vanish as the number of players $N$ goes to infinity) beyond variants of zero-sum and potential games. When evaluated by the cumulative deviation from Nash equilibria, the algorithm is shown to achieve a high probability regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{3/4}+N^{-1/2}M)$ for games with the strong Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, and a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{11/12}+N^{- 1/6}M)$ for games with only the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, where $M$ is the total number of episodes and $N$ is the number of agents of the game. As a byproduct, we also obtain the first tractable globally convergent computational algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of monotone mean-field games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaejeong Lee, Jeongwhan Choi, Hyowon Wi, Sung-Bae Cho, Noseong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based collaborative filtering (CF) has emerged as a promising approach in recommendation systems. Despite its achievements, graph-based CF models face challenges due to data sparsity and negative sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic sampling for i) COntrastive views and ii) hard NEgative samples (SCONE) to overcome these issues. By considering that they are both sampling tasks, we generate dynamic augmented views and diverse hard negative samples via our unified stochastic sampling framework based on score-based generative models. In our comprehensive evaluations with 6 benchmark datasets, our proposed SCONE significantly improves recommendation accuracy and robustness, and demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing CF models. Furthermore, we prove the efficacy of user-item specific stochastic sampling for addressing the user sparsity and item popularity issues. The integration of the stochastic sampling and graph-based CF obtains the state-of-the-art in personalized recommendation systems, making significant strides in information-rich environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenning Yang, Ryan Krawec, Liang-Yuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are proved to be very powerful on different NLP tasks. However, there are still many ways to attack the model with very low costs. How to defend the model becomes an important problem. In our work, we treat adversarial attack results as a new (unseen) domain of the model, and we frame the defending problem into how to improve the robustness of the model on the new domain. We focus on the task of conversation entailment, where multi-turn natural language dialogues are the premise, and the transformer model is fine-tuned to predict whether a given hypothesis about the given dialogue is true or false. The adversary would attack the hypothesis to fool the model to make the wrong predictions. We apply synonym-swapping as the attack method. To show the robustness of the model, we implement some fine-tuning strategies and propose the embedding perturbation loss as a method to improve the robustness of the model. Finally, we show the importance of our work by discussing the adversarial attacks in NLP in the real world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jionghao Lin, Eason Chen, Zeifei Han, Ashish Gurung, Danielle R. Thomas, Wei Tan, Ngoc Dang Nguyen, Kenneth R. Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated explanatory feedback systems play a crucial role in facilitating learning for a large cohort of learners by offering feedback that incorporates explanations, significantly enhancing the learning process. However, delivering such explanatory feedback in real-time poses challenges, particularly when high classification accuracy for domain-specific, nuanced responses is essential. Our study leverages the capabilities of large language models, specifically Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT), to explore a sequence labeling approach focused on identifying components of desired and less desired praise for providing explanatory feedback within a tutor training dataset. Our aim is to equip tutors with actionable, explanatory feedback during online training lessons. To investigate the potential of GPT models for providing the explanatory feedback, we employed two commonly-used approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. To quantify the quality of highlighted praise components identified by GPT models, we introduced a Modified Intersection over Union (M-IoU) score. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) the M-IoU score effectively correlates with human judgment in evaluating sequence quality; (2) using two-shot prompting on GPT-3.5 resulted in decent performance in recognizing effort-based (M-IoU of 0.46) and outcome-based praise (M-IoU of 0.68); and (3) our optimally fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model achieved M-IoU scores of 0.64 for effort-based praise and 0.84 for outcome-based praise, aligning with the satisfaction levels evaluated by human coders. Our results show promise for using GPT models to provide feedback that focuses on specific elements in their open-ended responses that are desirable or could use improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyuan Li, Ying Zhang, Yusong Wang, Funakoshi Kataro, Manabu Okumura</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has garnered increasing attention due to its wide range of applications in various fields, including human-machine interaction, virtual assistants, and mental health assistance. However, existing SER methods often overlook the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream SER task, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, current methods require much time for fine-tuning on each specific speech dataset, such as IEMOCAP, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale noisy data. To address these issues, we propose an active learning (AL)-based fine-tuning framework for SER, called \textsc{After}, that leverages task adaptation pre-training (TAPT) and AL methods to enhance performance and efficiency. Specifically, we first use TAPT to minimize the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream speech emotion recognition task. Then, AL methods are employed to iteratively select a subset of the most informative and diverse samples for fine-tuning, thereby reducing time consumption. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method \textsc{After}, using only 20\% of samples, improves accuracy by 8.45\% and reduces time consumption by 79\%. The additional extension of \textsc{After} and ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness and applicability to various real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayou Du, Gu Gong, Xiaowen Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently garnered considerable attention, emerging as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in several vision-related applications. However, their large model sizes and high computational and memory demands hinder deployment, especially on resource-constrained devices. This underscores the necessity of algorithm-hardware co-design specific to ViTs, aiming to optimize their performance by tailoring both the algorithmic structure and the underlying hardware accelerator to each other's strengths. Model quantization, by converting high-precision numbers to lower-precision, reduces the computational demands and memory needs of ViTs, allowing the creation of hardware specifically optimized for these quantized algorithms, boosting efficiency. This article provides a comprehensive survey of ViTs quantization and its hardware acceleration. We first delve into the unique architectural attributes of ViTs and their runtime characteristics. Subsequently, we examine the fundamental principles of model quantization, followed by a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art quantization techniques for ViTs. Additionally, we explore the hardware acceleration of quantized ViTs, highlighting the importance of hardware-friendly algorithm design. In conclusion, this article will discuss ongoing challenges and future research paths.

<p>Abstract: Data augmentation serves as a popular regularization technique to combat overfitting challenges in neural networks. While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning never ends, and there is no age limit to grow yourself. However, the educational landscape may face challenges in effectively catering to students' inclusion and diverse learning needs. These students should have access to state-of-the-art methods for lecture delivery, online resources, and technology needs. However, with all the diverse learning sources, it becomes harder for students to comprehend a large amount of knowledge in a short period of time. Traditional assistive technologies and learning aids often lack the dynamic adaptability required for individualized education plans. Large Language Models (LLM) have been used in language translation, text summarization, and content generation applications. With rapid growth in AI over the past years, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have been developed. This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing an innovative study buddy we will be calling the 'SAMCares'. The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) (in our case, LLaMa-2 70B as the base model) and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer real-time, context-aware, and adaptive educational support. The context of the model will be limited to the knowledge base of Sam Houston State University (SHSU) course notes. The LLM component enables a chat-like environment to interact with it to meet the unique learning requirements of each student. For this, we will build a custom web-based GUI. At the same time, RAG enhances real-time information retrieval and text generation, in turn providing more accurate and context-specific assistance. An option to upload additional study materials in the web GUI is added in case additional knowledge support is required. The system's efficacy will be evaluated through controlled trials and iterative feedback mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zidong Cao, Zhan Wang, Yexin Liu, Yan-Pei Cao, Ying Shan, Wei Zeng, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Viewing omnidirectional images (ODIs) in virtual reality (VR) represents a novel form of media that provides immersive experiences for users to navigate and interact with digital content. Nonetheless, this sense of immersion can be greatly compromised by a blur effect that masks details and hampers the user's ability to engage with objects of interest. In this paper, we present a novel system, called OmniVR, designed to enhance visual clarity during VR navigation. Our system enables users to effortlessly locate and zoom in on the objects of interest in VR. It captures user commands for navigation and zoom, converting these inputs into parameters for the Mobius transformation matrix. Leveraging these parameters, the ODI is refined using a learning-based algorithm. The resultant ODI is presented within the VR media, effectively reducing blur and increasing user engagement. To verify the effectiveness of our system, we first evaluate our algorithm with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets, which achieves the best performance. Furthermore, we undertake a comprehensive user study to evaluate viewer experiences across diverse scenarios and to gather their qualitative feedback from multiple perspectives. The outcomes reveal that our system enhances user engagement by improving the viewers' recognition, reducing discomfort, and improving the overall immersive experience. Our system makes the navigation and zoom more user-friendly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoori Oh, Yoseob Han, Kyogu Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been growing interest in audio-language retrieval research, where the objective is to establish the correlation between audio and text modalities. However, most audio-text paired datasets often lack rich expression of the text data compared to the audio samples. One of the significant challenges facing audio-text datasets is the presence of similar or identical captions despite different audio samples. Therefore, under many-to-one mapping conditions, audio-text datasets lead to poor performance of retrieval tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle the data imbalance problem in audio-language retrieval task. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a method that employs a distance sampling-based paraphraser leveraging ChatGPT, utilizing distance function to generate a controllable distribution of manipulated text data. For a set of sentences with the same context, the distance is used to calculate a degree of manipulation for any two sentences, and ChatGPT's few-shot prompting is performed using a text cluster with a similar distance defined by the Jaccard similarity. Therefore, ChatGPT, when applied to few-shot prompting with text clusters, can adjust the diversity of the manipulated text based on the distance. The proposed approach is shown to significantly enhance performance in audio-text retrieval, outperforming conventional text augmentation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Gibert, Luca Demetrio, Giulio Zizzo, Quan Le, Jordi Planes, Battista Biggio</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based malware detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial EXEmples - carefully-crafted malicious programs that evade detection with minimal perturbation. As such, the community is dedicating effort to develop mechanisms to defend against adversarial EXEmples. However, current randomized smoothing-based defenses are still vulnerable to attacks that inject blocks of adversarial content. In this paper, we introduce a certifiable defense against patch attacks that guarantees, for a given executable and an adversarial patch size, no adversarial EXEmple exist. Our method is inspired by (de)randomized smoothing which provides deterministic robustness certificates. During training, a base classifier is trained using subsets of continguous bytes. At inference time, our defense splits the executable into non-overlapping chunks, classifies each chunk independently, and computes the final prediction through majority voting to minimize the influence of injected content. Furthermore, we introduce a preprocessing step that fixes the size of the sections and headers to a multiple of the chunk size. As a consequence, the injected content is confined to an integer number of chunks without tampering the other chunks containing the real bytes of the input examples, allowing us to extend our certified robustness guarantees to content insertion attacks. We perform an extensive ablation study, by comparing our defense with randomized smoothing-based defenses against a plethora of content manipulation attacks and neural network architectures. Results show that our method exhibits unmatched robustness against strong content-insertion attacks, outperforming randomized smoothing-based defenses in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Chahoud, Azzam Mourad, Hadi Otrok, Jamal Bentahar, Mohsen Guizani</p>
<p>Abstract: Containerization technology plays a crucial role in Federated Learning (FL) setups, expanding the pool of potential clients and ensuring the availability of specific subsets for each learning iteration. However, doubts arise about the trustworthiness of devices deployed as clients in FL scenarios, especially when container deployment processes are involved. Addressing these challenges is important, particularly in managing potentially malicious clients capable of disrupting the learning process or compromising the entire model. In our research, we are motivated to integrate a trust element into the client selection and model deployment processes within our system architecture. This is a feature lacking in the initial client selection and deployment mechanism of the On-Demand architecture. We introduce a trust mechanism, named "Trusted-On-Demand-FL", which establishes a relationship of trust between the server and the pool of eligible clients. Utilizing Docker in our deployment strategy enables us to monitor and validate participant actions effectively, ensuring strict adherence to agreed-upon protocols while strengthening defenses against unauthorized data access or tampering. Our simulations rely on a continuous user behavior dataset, deploying an optimization model powered by a genetic algorithm to efficiently select clients for participation. By assigning trust values to individual clients and dynamically adjusting these values, combined with penalizing malicious clients through decreased trust scores, our proposed framework identifies and isolates harmful clients. This approach not only reduces disruptions to regular rounds but also minimizes instances of round dismissal, Consequently enhancing both system stability and security.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate self-supervised pre-training methods for document text recognition. Nowadays, large unlabeled datasets can be collected for many research tasks, including text recognition, but it is costly to annotate them. Therefore, methods utilizing unlabeled data are researched. We study self-supervised pre-training methods based on masked label prediction using three different approaches -- Feature Quantization, VQ-VAE, and Post-Quantized AE. We also investigate joint-embedding approaches with VICReg and NT-Xent objectives, for which we propose an image shifting technique to prevent model collapse where it relies solely on positional encoding while completely ignoring the input image. We perform our experiments on historical handwritten (Bentham) and historical printed datasets mainly to investigate the benefits of the self-supervised pre-training techniques with different amounts of annotated target domain data. We use transfer learning as strong baselines. The evaluation shows that the self-supervised pre-training on data from the target domain is very effective, but it struggles to outperform transfer learning from closely related domains. This paper is one of the first researches exploring self-supervised pre-training in document text recognition, and we believe that it will become a cornerstone for future research in this area. We made our implementation of the investigated methods publicly available at https://github.com/DCGM/pero-pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishav Mukherji, Mark Sch\"one, Khaleelulla Khan Nazeer, Christian Mayr, David Kappel, Anand Subramoney</p>
<p>Abstract: Activity and parameter sparsity are two standard methods of making neural networks computationally more efficient. Event-based architectures such as spiking neural networks (SNNs) naturally exhibit activity sparsity, and many methods exist to sparsify their connectivity by pruning weights. While the effect of weight pruning on feed-forward SNNs has been previously studied for computer vision tasks, the effects of pruning for complex sequence tasks like language modeling are less well studied since SNNs have traditionally struggled to achieve meaningful performance on these tasks. Using a recently published SNN-like architecture that works well on small-scale language modeling, we study the effects of weight pruning when combined with activity sparsity. Specifically, we study the trade-off between the multiplicative efficiency gains the combination affords and its effect on task performance for language modeling. To dissect the effects of the two sparsities, we conduct a comparative analysis between densely activated models and sparsely activated event-based models across varying degrees of connectivity sparsity. We demonstrate that sparse activity and sparse connectivity complement each other without a proportional drop in task performance for an event-based neural network trained on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 language modeling datasets. Our results suggest sparsely connected event-based neural networks are promising candidates for effective and efficient sequence modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masanari Kimura, Hiroki Naganuma</p>
<p>Abstract: The key factor in implementing machine learning algorithms in decision-making situations is not only the accuracy of the model but also its confidence level. The confidence level of a model in a classification problem is often given by the output vector of a softmax function for convenience. However, these values are known to deviate significantly from the actual expected model confidence. This problem is called model calibration and has been studied extensively. One of the simplest techniques to tackle this task is focal loss, a generalization of cross-entropy by introducing one positive parameter. Although many related studies exist because of the simplicity of the idea and its formalization, the theoretical analysis of its behavior is still insufficient. In this study, our objective is to understand the behavior of focal loss by reinterpreting this function geometrically. Our analysis suggests that focal loss reduces the curvature of the loss surface in training the model. This indicates that curvature may be one of the essential factors in achieving model calibration. We design numerical experiments to support this conjecture to reveal the behavior of focal loss and the relationship between calibration performance and curvature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Manzour Hussien, Angie Nataly Melo, Augusto Luis Ballardini, Carlota Salinas Maldonado, Rub\'en Izquierdo, Miguel \'Angel Sotelo</p>
<p>Abstract: Prediction of road users' behaviors in the context of autonomous driving has gained considerable attention by the scientific community in the last years. Most works focus on predicting behaviors based on kinematic information alone, a simplification of the reality since road users are humans, and as such they are highly influenced by their surrounding context. In addition, a large plethora of research works rely on powerful Deep Learning techniques, which exhibit high performance metrics in prediction tasks but may lack the ability to fully understand and exploit the contextual semantic information contained in the road scene, not to mention their inability to provide explainable predictions that can be understood by humans. In this work, we propose an explainable road users' behavior prediction system that integrates the reasoning abilities of Knowledge Graphs (KG) and the expressiveness capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) by using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. For that purpose, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) and Bayesian inference are combined to allow the deployment of a fully inductive reasoning system that enables the issuing of predictions that rely on legacy information contained in the graph as well as on current evidence gathered in real time by onboard sensors. Two use cases have been implemented following the proposed approach: 1) Prediction of pedestrians' crossing actions; 2) Prediction of lane change maneuvers. In both cases, the performance attained surpasses the current state of the art in terms of anticipation and F1-score, showing a promising avenue for future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Ogorodova, Pakizar Shamoi, Aron Karatayev</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing software projects allows students to put knowledge into practice and gain teamwork skills. However, assessing student performance in project-oriented courses poses significant challenges, particularly as the size of classes increases. The current paper introduces a fuzzy intelligent system designed to evaluate academic software projects using object-oriented programming and design course as an example. To establish evaluation criteria, we first conducted a survey of student project teams (n=31) and faculty (n=3) to identify key parameters and their applicable ranges. The selected criteria - clean code, use of inheritance, and functionality - were selected as essential for assessing the quality of academic software projects. These criteria were then represented as fuzzy variables with corresponding fuzzy sets. Collaborating with three experts, including one professor and two course instructors, we defined a set of fuzzy rules for a fuzzy inference system. This system processes the input criteria to produce a quantifiable measure of project success. The system demonstrated promising results in automating the evaluation of projects. Our approach standardizes project evaluations and helps to reduce the subjective bias in manual grading.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushan Wang, Yanan Xin, Yatao Zhang, Fernando Perez-Cruz, Martin Raubal</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used in traffic forecasting and have achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. However, the black-box nature of those models makes the results difficult to interpret by users. This study aims to leverage an Explainable AI approach, counterfactual explanations, to enhance the explainability and usability of deep learning-based traffic forecasting models. Specifically, the goal is to elucidate relationships between various input contextual features and their corresponding predictions. We present a comprehensive framework that generates counterfactual explanations for traffic forecasting and provides usable insights through the proposed scenario-driven counterfactual explanations. The study first implements a deep learning model to predict traffic speed based on historical traffic data and contextual variables. Counterfactual explanations are then used to illuminate how alterations in these input variables affect predicted outcomes, thereby enhancing the transparency of the deep learning model. We investigated the impact of contextual features on traffic speed prediction under varying spatial and temporal conditions. The scenario-driven counterfactual explanations integrate two types of user-defined constraints, directional and weighting constraints, to tailor the search for counterfactual explanations to specific use cases. These tailored explanations benefit machine learning practitioners who aim to understand the model's learning mechanisms and domain experts who seek insights for real-world applications. The results showcase the effectiveness of counterfactual explanations in revealing traffic patterns learned by deep learning models, showing its potential for interpreting black-box deep learning models used for spatiotemporal predictions in general.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ultrasound robots are increasingly used in medical diagnostics and early disease screening. However, current ultrasound robots lack the intelligence to understand human intentions and instructions, hindering autonomous ultrasound scanning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Ultrasound Embodied Intelligence system that equips ultrasound robots with the large language model (LLM) and domain knowledge, thereby improving the efficiency of ultrasound robots. Specifically, we first design an ultrasound operation knowledge database to add expertise in ultrasound scanning to the LLM, enabling the LLM to perform precise motion planning. Furthermore, we devise a dynamic ultrasound scanning strategy based on a \textit{think-observe-execute} prompt engineering, allowing LLMs to dynamically adjust motion planning strategies during the scanning procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system significantly improves ultrasound scan efficiency and quality from verbal commands. This advancement in autonomous medical scanning technology contributes to non-invasive diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jincheng Zhang, Qijun Zhao, Tie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To facilitate the re-identification (Re-ID) of individual animals, existing methods primarily focus on maximizing feature similarity within the same individual and enhancing distinctiveness between different individuals. However, most of them still rely on supervised learning and require substantial labeled data, which is challenging to obtain. To avoid this issue, we propose a Feature-Aware Noise Contrastive Learning (FANCL) method to explore an unsupervised learning solution, which is then validated on the task of red panda re-ID. FANCL employs a Feature-Aware Noise Addition module to produce noised images that conceal critical features and designs two contrastive learning modules to calculate the losses. Firstly, a feature consistency module is designed to bridge the gap between the original and noised features. Secondly, the neural networks are trained through a cluster contrastive learning module. Through these more challenging learning tasks, FANCL can adaptively extract deeper representations of red pandas. The experimental results on a set of red panda images collected in both indoor and outdoor environments prove that FANCL outperforms several related state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving high performance comparable to supervised learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Peeperkorn, Tom Kouwenhoven, Dan Brown, Anna Jordanous</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism. The temperature parameter of an LLM regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter. Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model and prompt. Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the LLM output for different temperature values using four necessary conditions for creativity in narrative generation: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality. However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results suggest that the LLM generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher. Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled LLM creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas-Andre\"i Thil, Mirela Popa, Gerasimos Spanakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable improvements in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as web navigation. Supervised learning (SL) approaches have achieved impressive performance while utilizing significantly less training data compared to previous methods. However, these SL-based models fall short when compared to reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which have shown superior results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines SL and RL techniques over the MiniWoB benchmark to leverage the strengths of both methods. We also address a critical limitation in previous models' understanding of HTML content, revealing a tendency to memorize target elements rather than comprehend the underlying structure. To rectify this, we propose methods to enhance true understanding and present a new baseline of results. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SL methods on certain tasks using less data and narrows the performance gap with RL models, achieving 43.58\% average accuracy in SL and 36.69\% when combined with a multimodal RL approach. This study sets a new direction for future web navigation and offers insights into the limitations and potential of language modeling for computer tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quy Hoang Nguyen, Minh-Van Truong Nguyen, Kiet Van Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of multimodal data on social media platforms presents new opportunities to better understand user sentiments toward a given aspect. However, existing multimodal datasets for Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis (ACSA) often focus on textual annotations, neglecting fine-grained information in images. Consequently, these datasets fail to fully exploit the richness inherent in multimodal. To address this, we introduce a new Vietnamese multimodal dataset, named ViMACSA, which consists of 4,876 text-image pairs with 14,618 fine-grained annotations for both text and image in the hotel domain. Additionally, we propose a Fine-Grained Cross-Modal Fusion Framework (FCMF) that effectively learns both intra- and inter-modality interactions and then fuses these information to produce a unified multimodal representation. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms SOTA models on the ViMACSA dataset, achieving the highest F1 score of 79.73%. We also explore characteristics and challenges in Vietnamese multimodal sentiment analysis, including misspellings, abbreviations, and the complexities of the Vietnamese language. This work contributes both a benchmark dataset and a new framework that leverages fine-grained multimodal information to improve multimodal aspect-category sentiment analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhili Liu, Yunhao Gou, Kai Chen, Lanqing Hong, Jiahui Gao, Fei Mi, Yu Zhang, Zhenguo Li, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, James T. Kwok</p>
<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have expanded dramatically, aligning these models with human values presents a significant challenge, posing potential risks during deployment. Traditional alignment strategies rely heavily on human intervention, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or on the self-alignment capacities of LLMs, which usually require a strong LLM's emergent ability to improve its original bad answer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-alignment method that utilizes a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, termed AlignCoT. This method encompasses stages of Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, and Safe Answer production. It is designed to enable LLMs to generate high-quality, safe responses throughout various stages of their development. Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE) architecture, which applies the mixture of experts to enhance each component of the AlignCoT process, markedly increasing alignment efficiency. The MoTE approach not only outperforms existing methods in aligning LLMs with human values but also highlights the benefits of using self-generated data, revealing the dual benefits of improved alignment and training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingze Zeng, Naili Xing, Shaofeng Cai, Gang Chen, Beng Chin Ooi, Jian Pei, Yuncheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are widely used for the storage and retrieval of structured data. To derive insights beyond statistical aggregation, we typically have to extract specific subdatasets from the database using conventional database operations, and then apply deep neural networks (DNN) training and inference on these respective subdatasets in a separate machine learning system. The process can be prohibitively expensive, especially when there are a combinatorial number of subdatasets extracted for different analytical purposes. This calls for efficient in-database support of advanced analytical methods In this paper, we introduce LEADS, a novel SQL-aware dynamic model slicing technique to customize models for subdatasets specified by SQL queries. LEADS improves the predictive modeling of structured data via the mixture of experts (MoE) technique and maintains inference efficiency by a SQL-aware gating network. At the core of LEADS is the construction of a general model with multiple expert sub-models via MoE trained over the entire database. This SQL-aware MoE technique scales up the modeling capacity, enhances effectiveness, and preserves efficiency by activating only necessary experts via the gating network during inference. Additionally, we introduce two regularization terms during the training process of LEADS to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency. We also design and build an in-database inference system, called INDICES, to support end-to-end advanced structured data analytics by non-intrusively incorporating LEADS onto PostgreSQL. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LEADS consistently outperforms baseline models, and INDICES delivers effective in-database analytics with a considerable reduction in inference latency compared to traditional solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Regional traffic forecasting is a critical challenge in urban mobility, with applications to various fields such as the Internet of Everything. In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Kyun Jang, Dat Huynh, Ashish Shah, Wen-Kai Chen, Ser-Nam Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that retrieves images using a query, which is configured with an image and a caption that describes desired modifications to that image. Supervised CIR approaches have shown strong performance, but their reliance on expensive manually-annotated datasets restricts their scalability and broader applicability. To address these issues, previous studies have proposed pseudo-word token-based Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods, which utilize a projection module to map images to word tokens. However, we conjecture that this approach has a downside: the projection module distorts the original image representation and confines the resulting composed embeddings to the text-side. In order to resolve this, we introduce a novel ZS-CIR method that uses Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) to directly merge image and text representations by identifying an intermediate embedding of both. Furthermore, we introduce Text-Anchored-Tuning (TAT), a method that fine-tunes the image encoder while keeping the text encoder fixed. TAT closes the modality gap between images and text, making the Slerp process much more effective. Notably, the TAT method is not only efficient in terms of the scale of the training dataset and training time, but it also serves as an excellent initial checkpoint for training supervised CIR models, thereby highlighting its wider potential. The integration of the Slerp-based ZS-CIR with a TAT-tuned model enables our approach to deliver state-of-the-art retrieval performance across CIR benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model alignment is widely used and studied to avoid LLM producing unhelpful and harmful responses. However, the lengthy training process and predefined preference bias hinder adaptation to online diverse human preferences. To this end, this paper proposes an alignment framework, called Reinforcement Learning with Human Behavior (RLHB), to align LLMs by directly leveraging real online human behaviors. By taking the generative adversarial framework, the generator is trained to respond following expected human behavior; while the discriminator tries to verify whether the triplets of query, response, and human behavior come from real online environments. Behavior modeling in natural-language form and the multi-model joint training mechanism enable an active and sustainable online alignment. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed methods by both human and automatic evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Catarina G Bel\'em, Preethi Seshadri, Yasaman Razeghi, Sameer Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions. A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data. In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings? To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios. USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations. To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation. Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models. Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words. These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation. We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causal reasoning is viewed as crucial for achieving human-level machine intelligence. Recent advances in language models have expanded the horizons of artificial intelligence across various domains, sparking inquiries into their potential for causal reasoning. In this work, we introduce Causal evaluation of Language Models (CaLM), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the causal reasoning capabilities of language models. First, we propose the CaLM framework, which establishes a foundational taxonomy consisting of four modules: causal target (i.e., what to evaluate), adaptation (i.e., how to obtain the results), metric (i.e., how to measure the results), and error (i.e., how to analyze the bad results). This taxonomy defines a broad evaluation design space while systematically selecting criteria and priorities. Second, we compose the CaLM dataset, comprising 126,334 data samples, to provide curated sets of causal targets, adaptations, metrics, and errors, offering extensive coverage for diverse research pursuits. Third, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 28 leading language models on a core set of 92 causal targets, 9 adaptations, 7 metrics, and 12 error types. Fourth, we perform detailed analyses of the evaluation results across various dimensions (e.g., adaptation, scale). Fifth, we present 50 high-level empirical findings across 9 dimensions (e.g., model), providing valuable guidance for future language model development. Finally, we develop a multifaceted platform, including a website, leaderboards, datasets, and toolkits, to support scalable and adaptable assessments. We envision CaLM as an ever-evolving benchmark for the community, systematically updated with new causal targets, adaptations, models, metrics, and error types to reflect ongoing research advancements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunnie S. Y. Kim, Q. Vera Liao, Mihaela Vorvoreanu, Stephanie Ballard, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan</p>
<p>Abstract: Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growth of Renewable Energy (RE) generation, the operation of power grids has become increasingly complex. One solution is automated grid operation, where Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has repeatedly shown significant potential in Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) challenges. However, only individual actions at the substation level have been subjected to topology optimization by most existing DRL algorithms. In contrast, we propose a more holistic approach in this paper by proposing specific Target Topologies (TTs) as actions. These topologies are selected based on their robustness. As part of this paper, we present a search algorithm to find the TTs and upgrade our previously developed DRL agent CurriculumAgent (CAgent) to a novel topology agent. We compare the upgrade to the previous CAgent agent and can increase their scores significantly by 10%. Further, we achieve a 25% better median survival with our TTs included. Later analysis shows that almost all TTs are close to the base topology, explaining their robustness.</p>

Although quantized weights offer storage efficiency and allow for faster inference, existing works have indicated that quantization might compromise performance and exacerbate biases in LLMs. This study investigates the confidence and calibration of quantized models, considering factors such as language model type and scale as contributors to quantization loss. Firstly, we reveal that quantization with GPTQ to 4-bit results in a decrease in confidence regarding true labels, with varying impacts observed among different language models. Secondly, we observe fluctuations in the impact on confidence across different scales. Finally, we propose an explanation for quantization loss based on confidence levels, indicating that quantization disproportionately affects samples where the full model exhibited low confidence levels in the first place.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongqi Pu, Vera Demberg</p>
<p>Abstract: For long document summarization, discourse structure is important to discern the key content of the text and the differences in importance level between sentences. Unfortunately, the integration of rhetorical structure theory (RST) into parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for long document summarization remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper introduces RST-LoRA and proposes four RST-aware variants to explicitly incorporate RST into the LoRA model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that incorporating the type and uncertainty of rhetorical relations can complementarily enhance the performance of LoRA in summarization tasks. Furthermore, the best-performing variant we introduced outperforms the vanilla LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning models, as confirmed by multiple automatic and human evaluations, and even surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsang Yoon, Akshat Gupta, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a targeted model editing analysis focused on the latest large language model, Llama-3. We explore the efficacy of popular model editing techniques - ROME, MEMIT, and EMMET, which are designed for precise layer interventions. We identify the most effective layers for targeted edits through an evaluation that encompasses up to 4096 edits across three distinct strategies: sequential editing, batch editing, and a hybrid approach we call as sequential-batch editing. Our findings indicate that increasing edit batch-sizes may degrade model performance more significantly than using smaller edit batches sequentially for equal number of edits. With this, we argue that sequential model editing is an important component for scaling model editing methods and future research should focus on methods that combine both batched and sequential editing. This observation suggests a potential limitation in current model editing methods which push towards bigger edit batch sizes, and we hope it paves way for future investigations into optimizing batch sizes and model editing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Wu, Zhiqing Sun, Huizhuo Yuan, Kaixuan Ji, Yiming Yang, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches relying on parametric models like the Bradley-Terry model fall short in capturing the intransitivity and irrationality in human preferences. Recent advancements suggest that directly working with preference probabilities can yield a more accurate reflection of human preferences, enabling more flexible and accurate language model alignment. In this paper, we propose a self-play-based method for language model alignment, which treats the problem as a constant-sum two-player game aimed at identifying the Nash equilibrium policy. Our approach, dubbed \textit{Self-Play Preference Optimization} (SPPO), approximates the Nash equilibrium through iterative policy updates and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantee. Our method can effectively increase the log-likelihood of the chosen response and decrease that of the rejected response, which cannot be trivially achieved by symmetric pairwise loss such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). In our experiments, using only 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging a pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model from fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled win-rate of 28.53% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative) DPO and IPO on MT-Bench and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Notably, the strong performance of SPPO is achieved without additional external supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: A central challenge for cognitive science is to explain how abstract concepts are acquired from limited experience. This has often been framed in terms of a dichotomy between connectionist and symbolic cognitive models. Here, we highlight a recently emerging line of work that suggests a novel reconciliation of these approaches, by exploiting an inductive bias that we term the relational bottleneck. In that approach, neural networks are constrained via their architecture to focus on relations between perceptual inputs, rather than the attributes of individual inputs. We review a family of models that employ this approach to induce abstractions in a data-efficient manner, emphasizing their potential as candidate models for the acquisition of abstract concepts in the human mind and brain.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI alignment aims to make AI systems behave in line with human intentions and values. As AI systems grow more capable, so do risks from misalignment. To provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the alignment field, in this survey, we delve into the core concepts, methodology, and practice of alignment. First, we identify four principles as the key objectives of AI alignment: Robustness, Interpretability, Controllability, and Ethicality (RICE). Guided by these four principles, we outline the landscape of current alignment research and decompose them into two key components: forward alignment and backward alignment. The former aims to make AI systems aligned via alignment training, while the latter aims to gain evidence about the systems' alignment and govern them appropriately to avoid exacerbating misalignment risks. On forward alignment, we discuss techniques for learning from feedback and learning under distribution shift. On backward alignment, we discuss assurance techniques and governance practices.
  We also release and continually update the website (www.alignmentsurvey.com) which features tutorials, collections of papers, blog posts, and other resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: We build a computational model of how humans actively infer hidden rules by doing experiments. The basic principles behind the model is that, even if the rule is deterministic, the learner considers a broader space of fuzzy probabilistic rules, which it represents in natural language, and updates its hypotheses online after each experiment according to approximately Bayesian principles. In the same framework we also model experiment design according to information-theoretic criteria. We find that the combination of these three principles -- explicit hypotheses, probabilistic rules, and online updates -- can explain human performance on a Zendo-style task, and that removing any of these components leaves the model unable to account for the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tessa Han, Aounon Kumar, Chirag Agarwal, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop ever-improving capabilities and are applied in real-world settings, it is important to understand their safety. While initial steps have been taken to evaluate the safety of general-knowledge LLMs, exposing some weaknesses, the safety of medical LLMs has not been sufficiently evaluated despite their high risks to personal health and safety, public health and safety, patient rights, and human rights. To address this gap, we conduct, to our knowledge, the first study of its kind to evaluate and improve the safety of medical LLMs. We find that 1) current medical LLMs do not meet standards of general or medical safety, as they readily comply with harmful requests and that 2) fine-tuning medical LLMs on safety demonstrations significantly improves their safety, reducing their tendency to comply with harmful requests. In addition, we present a definition of medical safety for LLMs and develop a benchmark dataset to evaluate and train for medical safety in LLMs. Poised at the intersection of research on machine learning safety and medical machine learning, this work casts light on the status quo of the safety of medical LLMs and motivates future work in this area, mitigating the risks of harm of LLMs in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madeleine I. G. Daepp, Scott Counts</p>
<p>Abstract: The digital divide describes disparities in access to and usage of digital tooling between social and economic groups. Emerging generative artificial intelligence tools, which strongly affect productivity, could magnify the impact of these divides. However, the affordability, multi-modality, and multilingual capabilities of these tools could also make them more accessible to diverse users in comparison with previous forms of digital tooling. In this study, we characterize spatial differences in U.S. residents' knowledge of a new generative AI tool, ChatGPT, through an analysis of state- and county-level search query data. In the first six months after the tool's release, we observe the highest rates of users searching for ChatGPT in West Coast states and persistently low rates of search in Appalachian and Gulf states. Counties with the highest rates of search are relatively more urbanized and have proportionally more educated, more economically advantaged, and more Asian residents in comparison with other counties or with the U.S. average. In multilevel models adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as industry makeup, education is the strongest positive predictor of rates of search for generative AI tooling. Although generative AI technologies may be novel, early differences in uptake appear to be following familiar paths of digital marginalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Excellence in a wide variety of medical applications poses considerable challenges for AI, requiring advanced reasoning, access to up-to-date medical knowledge and understanding of complex multimodal data. Gemini models, with strong general capabilities in multimodal and long-context reasoning, offer exciting possibilities in medicine. Building on these core strengths of Gemini, we introduce Med-Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models that are specialized in medicine with the ability to seamlessly use web search, and that can be efficiently tailored to novel modalities using custom encoders. We evaluate Med-Gemini on 14 medical benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on 10 of them, and surpass the GPT-4 model family on every benchmark where a direct comparison is viable, often by a wide margin. On the popular MedQA (USMLE) benchmark, our best-performing Med-Gemini model achieves SoTA performance of 91.1% accuracy, using a novel uncertainty-guided search strategy. On 7 multimodal benchmarks including NEJM Image Challenges and MMMU (health & medicine), Med-Gemini improves over GPT-4V by an average relative margin of 44.5%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-Gemini's long-context capabilities through SoTA performance on a needle-in-a-haystack retrieval task from long de-identified health records and medical video question answering, surpassing prior bespoke methods using only in-context learning. Finally, Med-Gemini's performance suggests real-world utility by surpassing human experts on tasks such as medical text summarization, alongside demonstrations of promising potential for multimodal medical dialogue, medical research and education. Taken together, our results offer compelling evidence for Med-Gemini's potential, although further rigorous evaluation will be crucial before real-world deployment in this safety-critical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanggyu Lee, Suchae Jeong, Jihie Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs trained in the understanding of programming syntax are now providing effective assistance to developers and are being used in programming education such as in generation of coding problem examples or providing code explanations. A key aspect of programming education is understanding and dealing with error message. However, 'logical errors' in which the program operates against the programmer's intentions do not receive error messages from the compiler. In this study, building on existing research on programming errors, we first define the types of logical errors that can occur in programming in general. Based on the definition, we propose an effective approach for detecting logical errors with LLMs that makes use of relations among error types in the Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought prompts. The experimental results indicate that when such logical error descriptions in the prompt are used, the average classifition performance is about 21% higher than the ones without them. We also conducted an experiment for exploiting the relations among errors in generating a new logical error dataset using LLMs. As there is very limited dataset for logical errors such benchmark dataset can be very useful for various programming related applications. We expect that our work can assist novice programmers in identifying the causes of code errors and correct them more effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Zhao, Changchun Yang, Artur Schweidtmann, Qian Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: The self-configuring nnU-Net has achieved leading performance in a large range of medical image segmentation challenges. It is widely considered as the model of choice and a strong baseline for medical image segmentation. However, despite its extraordinary performance, nnU-Net does not supply a measure of uncertainty to indicate its possible failure. This can be problematic for large-scale image segmentation applications, where data are heterogeneous and nnU-Net may fail without notice. In this work, we introduce a novel method to estimate nnU-Net uncertainty for medical image segmentation. We propose a highly effective scheme for posterior sampling of weight space for Bayesian uncertainty estimation. Different from previous baseline methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout and mean-field Bayesian Neural Networks, our proposed method does not require a variational architecture and keeps the original nnU-Net architecture intact, thereby preserving its excellent performance and ease of use. Additionally, we boost the segmentation performance over the original nnU-Net via marginalizing multi-modal posterior models. We applied our method on the public ACDC and M&M datasets of cardiac MRI and demonstrated improved uncertainty estimation over a range of baseline methods. The proposed method further strengthens nnU-Net for medical image segmentation in terms of both segmentation accuracy and quality control.</p>

<p>Abstract: We build on the view of the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) as an instantiation of Optimal Transport described by a functional convection-diffusion equation. We provide a new information theoretic perspective for understanding the ERG through the intermediary of Bayesian Statistical Inference. This connection is facilitated by the Dynamical Bayesian Inference scheme, which encodes Bayesian inference in the form of a one parameter family of probability distributions solving an integro-differential equation derived from Bayes' law. In this note, we demonstrate how the Dynamical Bayesian Inference equation is, itself, equivalent to a diffusion equation which we dub Bayesian Diffusion. Identifying the features that define Bayesian Diffusion, and mapping them onto the features that define the ERG, we obtain a dictionary outlining how renormalization can be understood as the inverse of statistical inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyan Su, Zhiheng Zhang, Jiyan Qiu, Jun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The identification of a seed set to maximize information spread in a network is crucial, a concept known as Influence Maximization (IM). Elegant IM algorithms could naturally extend to cases where each node is equipped with specific weight, referred to as individual effect, to measure the node's importance. Prevailing literature has typically assumed that the individual effect remains constant during the cascade process. However, this assumption is not always feasible, as the individual effect of each node is primarily evaluated by the difference between the outputs in the activated and non-activated states, with one of these states always being unobservable after propagation. Moreover, the individual effect is sensitive to the environmental information provided by surrounding nodes. To address these challenges, we extend the consideration of IM to a broader scenario involving general networks with dynamic node individual effects, leveraging causality techniques. In our paper, we address this through the development of a Causal Influence Maximization (CauIM) algorithm. Theoretically, for CauIM, we present the generalized lower bound of influence spread and provide robustness analysis. Empirically, in synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CauIM, along with a novel acceleration technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Ye, Zaixiang Zheng, Yu Bao, Lihua Qian, Mingxuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in generating continuous signals such as images and audio, it remains elusive for diffusion models in learning discrete sequence data like natural languages. Although recent advances circumvent this challenge of discreteness by embedding discrete tokens as continuous surrogates, they still fall short of satisfactory generation quality. To understand this, we first dive deep into the denoised training protocol of diffusion-based sequence generative models and determine their three severe problems, i.e., 1) failing to learn, 2) lack of scalability, and 3) neglecting source conditions. We argue that these problems can be boiled down to the pitfall of the not completely eliminated discreteness in the embedding space, and the scale of noises is decisive herein. In this paper, we introduce DINOISER to facilitate diffusion models for sequence generation by manipulating noises. We propose to adaptively determine the range of sampled noise scales for counter-discreteness training; and encourage the proposed diffused sequence learner to leverage source conditions with amplified noise scales during inference. Experiments show that DINOISER enables consistent improvement over the baselines of previous diffusion-based sequence generative models on several conditional sequence modeling benchmarks thanks to both effective training and inference strategies. Analyses further verify that DINOISER can make better use of source conditions to govern its generative process.</p>

We then relate the optimization of the VICReg objective to mutual information optimization, highlighting underlying assumptions and facilitating a constructive comparison with other SSL algorithms and derive a generalization bound for VICReg, revealing its inherent advantages for downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifeng Wang, Chufan Gao, Cao Xiao, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data prediction has been employed in medical applications such as patient health risk prediction. However, existing methods usually revolve around the algorithm design while overlooking the significance of data engineering. Medical tabular datasets frequently exhibit significant heterogeneity across different sources, with limited sample sizes per source. As such, previous predictors are often trained on manually curated small datasets that struggle to generalize across different tabular datasets during inference. This paper proposes to scale medical tabular data predictors (MediTab) to various tabular inputs with varying features. The method uses a data engine that leverages large language models (LLMs) to consolidate tabular samples to overcome the barrier across tables with distinct schema. It also aligns out-domain data with the target task using a "learn, annotate, and refinement" pipeline. The expanded training data then enables the pre-trained MediTab to infer for arbitrary tabular input in the domain without fine-tuning, resulting in significant improvements over supervised baselines: it reaches an average ranking of 1.57 and 1.00 on 7 patient outcome prediction datasets and 3 trial outcome prediction datasets, respectively. In addition, MediTab exhibits impressive zero-shot performances: it outperforms supervised XGBoost models by 8.9% and 17.2% on average in two prediction tasks, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity of offline RL methods is an important step towards making data-hungry RL algorithms practically viable. Currently, most results hinge on unrealistic assumptions about the data distribution -- namely that it comprises a set of i.i.d. trajectories collected by a single logging policy. We consider a more general setting where the dataset may have been gathered adaptively. We develop theory for the TMIS Offline Policy Evaluation (OPE) estimator in this generalized setting for tabular MDPs, deriving high-probability, instance-dependent bounds on its estimation error. We also recover minimax-optimal offline learning in the adaptive setting. Finally, we conduct simulations to empirically analyze the behavior of these estimators under adaptive and non-adaptive regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Tang, Xiaodan Xing, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based Generative Models have the potential to convert low-resolution CT images into high-resolution counterparts without long acquisition times and increased radiation exposure in thin-slice CT imaging. However, procuring appropriate training data for these Super-Resolution (SR) models is challenging. Previous SR research has simulated thick-slice CT images from thin-slice CT images to create training pairs. However, these methods either rely on simplistic interpolation techniques that lack realism or sinogram reconstruction, which require the release of raw data and complex reconstruction algorithms. Thus, we introduce a simple yet realistic method to generate thick CT images from thin-slice CT images, facilitating the creation of training pairs for SR algorithms. The training pairs produced by our method closely resemble real data distributions (PSNR=49.74 vs. 40.66, p$<$0.05). A multivariate Cox regression analysis involving thick slice CT images with lung fibrosis revealed that only the radiomics features extracted using our method demonstrated a significant correlation with mortality (HR=1.19 and HR=1.14, p$<$0.005). This paper represents the first to identify and address the challenge of generating appropriate paired training data for Deep Learning-based CT SR models, which enhances the efficacy and applicability of SR models in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent months have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment. This demonstrates that using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents, for which we believe our work is one of the first, seems promising and can be applied to optimize other models in the agent architecture to enhance agent performances over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damian Hodel, Jevin West</p>
<p>Abstract: In their recent Nature Human Behaviour paper, "Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models," (Webb, Holyoak, and Lu, 2023) the authors argue that "large language models such as GPT-3 have acquired an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a broad range of analogy problems." In this response, we provide counterexamples of the letter string analogies. In our tests, GPT-3 fails to solve simplest variations of the original tasks, whereas human performance remains consistently high across all modified versions. Zero-shot reasoning is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence. We do not see that evidence in our experiments. To strengthen claims of humanlike reasoning such as zero-shot reasoning, it is important that the field develop approaches that rule out data memorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inmo Yeon, Jung-Woo Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Room geometry is important prior information for implementing realistic 3D audio rendering. For this reason, various room geometry inference (RGI) methods have been developed by utilizing the time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information in room impulse responses (RIRs). However, the conventional RGI technique poses several assumptions, such as convex room shapes, the number of walls known in priori, and the visibility of first-order reflections. In this work, we introduce the RGI-Net which can estimate room geometries without the aforementioned assumptions. RGI-Net learns and exploits complex relationships between low-order and high-order reflections in RIRs and, thus, can estimate room shapes even when the shape is non-convex or first-order reflections are missing in the RIRs. RGI-Net includes the evaluation network that separately evaluates the presence probability of walls, so the geometry inference is possible without prior knowledge of the number of walls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Chapman, Lennie Wells, Ana Lawry Aguila</p>
<p>Abstract: The Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) family of methods is foundational in multiview learning. Regularised linear CCA methods can be seen to generalise Partial Least Squares (PLS) and be unified with a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP) framework. However, classical algorithms for these linear methods are computationally infeasible for large-scale data. Extensions to Deep CCA show great promise, but current training procedures are slow and complicated. First we propose a novel unconstrained objective that characterizes the top subspace of GEPs. Our core contribution is a family of fast algorithms for stochastic PLS, stochastic CCA, and Deep CCA, simply obtained by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the corresponding CCA objectives. Our algorithms show far faster convergence and recover higher correlations than the previous state-of-the-art on all standard CCA and Deep CCA benchmarks. These improvements allow us to perform a first-of-its-kind PLS analysis of an extremely large biomedical dataset from the UK Biobank, with over 33,000 individuals and 500,000 features. Finally, we apply our algorithms to match the performance of `CCA-family' Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and also present theory to clarify the links between these methods and classical CCA, laying the groundwork for future insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan-Nico Zaech, Martin Danelljan, Tolga Birdal, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is a promising approach for discrete and often NP-hard optimization problems. Current AQCs allow to implement problems of research interest, which has sparked the development of quantum representations for many computer vision tasks. Despite requiring multiple measurements from the noisy AQC, current approaches only utilize the best measurement, discarding information contained in the remaining ones. In this work, we explore the potential of using this information for probabilistic balanced k-means clustering. Instead of discarding non-optimal solutions, we propose to use them to compute calibrated posterior probabilities with little additional compute cost. This allows us to identify ambiguous solutions and data points, which we demonstrate on a D-Wave AQC on synthetic tasks and real visual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yecheng Jason Ma, William Liang, Guanzhi Wang, De-An Huang, Osbert Bastani, Dinesh Jayaraman, Yuke Zhu, Linxi Fan, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled as high-level semantic planners for sequential decision-making tasks. However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangchi Qiu, Ye Tao, Shirui Pan, Alan Wee-Chung Liew</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) utilize natural language interactions and dialogue history to infer user preferences and provide accurate recommendations. Due to the limited conversation context and background knowledge, existing CRSs rely on external sources such as knowledge graphs to enrich the context and model entities based on their inter-relations. However, these methods ignore the rich intrinsic information within entities. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge-Enhanced Entity Representation Learning (KERL) framework, which leverages both the knowledge graph and a pre-trained language model to improve the semantic understanding of entities for CRS. In our KERL framework, entity textual descriptions are encoded via a pre-trained language model, while a knowledge graph helps reinforce the representation of these entities. We also employ positional encoding to effectively capture the temporal information of entities in a conversation. The enhanced entity representation is then used to develop a recommender component that fuses both entity and contextual representations for more informed recommendations, as well as a dialogue component that generates informative entity-related information in the response text. A high-quality knowledge graph with aligned entity descriptions is constructed to facilitate our study, namely the Wiki Movie Knowledge Graph (WikiMKG). The experimental results show that KERL achieves state-of-the-art results in both recommendation and response generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Xiong, Hanze Dong, Chenlu Ye, Ziqi Wang, Han Zhong, Heng Ji, Nan Jiang, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the alignment process of generative models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees.
  Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Liu, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan, Xi Lin, Fu Luo, Zhenkun Wang, Zhichao Lu, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Heuristics are indispensable for tackling complex search and optimization problems. However, manual heuristic design is tedious and demands significant human intuition and experience. This paper introduces Evolution of Heuristic (EoH), a novel paradigm that leverages the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). EoH represents heuristic ideas through linguistic descriptions, termed thoughts, generated by LLMs, which are then translated into executable code representations. The coevolution of thoughts and codes within an evolutionary framework offers superior AHD performance while mitigating computational expenses. Comprehensive evaluations on three types of combinatorial optimization benchmarks demonstrate EoH's outperformance against existing AHD methods. Notably, EoH surpasses FunSearch, a concurrent work focus on code evolution, identifying superior heuristics with significantly fewer computational budgets (i.e., queries to LLMs) on online bin packing problem.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katja Grace, Harlan Stewart, Julia Fabienne Sandk\"uhler, Stephen Thomas, Ben Weinstein-Raun, Jan Brauner</p>
<p>Abstract: In the largest survey of its kind, 2,778 researchers who had published in top-tier artificial intelligence (AI) venues gave predictions on the pace of AI progress and the nature and impacts of advanced AI systems The aggregate forecasts give at least a 50% chance of AI systems achieving several milestones by 2028, including autonomously constructing a payment processing site from scratch, creating a song indistinguishable from a new song by a popular musician, and autonomously downloading and fine-tuning a large language model. If science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10% by 2027, and 50% by 2047. The latter estimate is 13 years earlier than that reached in a similar survey we conducted only one year earlier [Grace et al., 2022]. However, the chance of all human occupations becoming fully automatable was forecast to reach 10% by 2037, and 50% as late as 2116 (compared to 2164 in the 2022 survey).
  Most respondents expressed substantial uncertainty about the long-term value of AI progress: While 68.3% thought good outcomes from superhuman AI are more likely than bad, of these net optimists 48% gave at least a 5% chance of extremely bad outcomes such as human extinction, and 59% of net pessimists gave 5% or more to extremely good outcomes. Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction. More than half suggested that "substantial" or "extreme" concern is warranted about six different AI-related scenarios, including misinformation, authoritarian control, and inequality. There was disagreement about whether faster or slower AI progress would be better for the future of humanity. However, there was broad agreement that research aimed at minimizing potential risks from AI systems ought to be prioritized more.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heejoon Koo</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting next visit diagnosis using Electronic Health Records (EHR) is an essential task in healthcare, critical for devising proactive future plans for both healthcare providers and patients. Nonetheless, many preceding studies have not sufficiently addressed the heterogeneous and hierarchical characteristics inherent in EHR data, inevitably leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose NECHO, a novel medical code-centric multimodal contrastive EHR learning framework with hierarchical regularisation. First, we integrate multifaceted information encompassing medical codes, demographics, and clinical notes using a tailored network design and a pair of bimodal contrastive losses, all of which pivot around a medical codes representation. We also regularise modality-specific encoders using a parental level information in medical ontology to learn hierarchical structure of EHR data. A series of experiments on MIMIC-III data demonstrates effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the era of proliferation of large language and image generation models, the phenomenon of "model collapse" refers to the situation whereby as a model is trained recursively on data generated from previous generations of itself over time, its performance degrades until the model eventually becomes completely useless, i.e the model collapses. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the setting of high-dimensional regression and obtain analytic formulae which quantitatively outline this phenomenon in a broad range of regimes. In the special case of polynomial decaying spectral and source conditions, we obtain modified scaling laws which exhibit new crossover phenomena from fast to slow rates. We also propose a simple strategy based on adaptive regularization to mitigate model collapse. Our theoretical results are validated with experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modest at https://github.com/facebookresearch/FnCTOD</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Li, Tianle Liu, Naomi Bashkansky, David Bau, Fernanda Vi\'egas, Hanspeter Pfister, Martin Wattenberg</p>
<p>Abstract: System-prompting is a standard tool for customizing language-model chatbots, enabling them to follow a specific instruction. An implicit assumption in the use of system prompts is that they will be stable, so the chatbot will continue to generate text according to the stipulated instructions for the duration of a conversation. We propose a quantitative benchmark to test this assumption, evaluating instruction stability via self-chats between two instructed chatbots. Testing popular models like LLaMA2-chat-70B and GPT-3.5, we reveal a significant instruction drift within eight rounds of conversations. An empirical and theoretical analysis of this phenomenon suggests the transformer attention mechanism plays a role, due to attention decay over long exchanges. To combat attention decay and instruction drift, we propose a lightweight method called split-softmax, which compares favorably against two strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Safouane El Ghazouali, Youssef Mhirit, Ali Oukhrid, Umberto Michelucci, Hichem Nouira</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of computer vision, the integration of advanced techniques into the processing of RGB-D camera inputs poses a significant challenge, given the inherent complexities arising from diverse environmental conditions and varying object appearances. Therefore, this paper introduces FusionVision, an exhaustive pipeline adapted for the robust 3D segmentation of objects in RGB-D imagery. Traditional computer vision systems face limitations in simultaneously capturing precise object boundaries and achieving high-precision object detection on depth map as they are mainly proposed for RGB cameras. To address this challenge, FusionVision adopts an integrated approach by merging state-of-the-art object detection techniques, with advanced instance segmentation methods. The integration of these components enables a holistic (unified analysis of information obtained from both color \textit{RGB} and depth \textit{D} channels) interpretation of RGB-D data, facilitating the extraction of comprehensive and accurate object information. The proposed FusionVision pipeline employs YOLO for identifying objects within the RGB image domain. Subsequently, FastSAM, an innovative semantic segmentation model, is applied to delineate object boundaries, yielding refined segmentation masks. The synergy between these components and their integration into 3D scene understanding ensures a cohesive fusion of object detection and segmentation, enhancing overall precision in 3D object segmentation.

<p>Abstract: The African continent lacks enough qualified teachers which hampers the provision of adequate learning support. An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world benchmark for such an AI: "Build an AI to compete live in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition". The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojie Xin, Xiaodong Zhang, Renzhi Tang, Songyang Yan, Qianrui Zhao, Chunze Yang, Wen Cui, Zijiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation is pivotal in evaluating the performance of autonomous driving systems due to the advantages of high efficiency and low cost compared to on-road testing. Bridging the gap between simulation and the real world requires realistic agent behaviors. However, the existing works have the following shortcomings in achieving this goal: (1) log replay offers realistic scenarios but often leads to collisions due to the absence of dynamic interactions, and (2) both heuristic-based and data-based solutions, which are parameterized and trained on real-world datasets, encourage interactions but often deviate from real-world data over long horizons. In this work, we propose LitSim, a long-term interactive simulation approach that maximizes realism by minimizing the interventions in the log. Specifically, our approach primarily uses log replay to ensure realism and intervenes only when necessary to prevent potential conflicts. We then encourage interactions among the agents and resolve the conflicts, thereby reducing the risk of unrealistic behaviors. We train and validate our model on the real-world dataset NGSIM, and the experimental results demonstrate that LitSim outperforms the currently popular approaches in terms of realism and reactivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nelson Col\'on Vargas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the intricate relationship between capitalism, racial injustice, and artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that AI acts as a contemporary vehicle for age-old forms of exploitation. By linking historical patterns of racial and economic oppression with current AI practices, this study illustrates how modern technology perpetuates and deepens societal inequalities. It specifically examines how AI is implicated in the exploitation of marginalized communities through underpaid labor in the gig economy, the perpetuation of biases in algorithmic decision-making, and the reinforcement of systemic barriers that prevent these groups from benefiting equitably from technological advances. Furthermore, the paper discusses the role of AI in extending and intensifying the social, economic, and psychological burdens faced by these communities, highlighting the problematic use of AI in surveillance, law enforcement, and mental health contexts. The analysis concludes with a call for transformative changes in how AI is developed and deployed. Advocating for a reevaluation of the values driving AI innovation, the paper promotes an approach that integrates social justice and equity into the core of technological design and policy. This shift is crucial for ensuring that AI serves as a tool for societal improvement, fostering empowerment and healing rather than deepening existing divides.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Zhou, Ashish Sharma, Amy X. Zhang, Tim Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world misinformation can be partially correct and even factual but misleading. It undermines public trust in science and democracy, particularly on social media, where it can spread rapidly. High-quality and timely correction of misinformation that identifies and explains its (in)accuracies has been shown to effectively reduce false beliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to be timely and scalable, a concern as technologies like large language models (LLMs) make misinformation easier to produce. LLMs also have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction-however, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving evidence as refutations or contexts, MUSE identifies and explains (in)accuracies in a piece of content-not presupposed to be misinformation-with references. It also describes images and conducts multimodal searches to verify and correct multimodal content. Fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social media content that are not presupposed to be (non-)misinformation but broadly include incorrect, partially correct, and correct posts, that may or may not be misleading. We propose and evaluate 13 dimensions of misinformation correction quality, ranging from the accuracy of identifications and factuality of explanations to the relevance and credibility of references. The results demonstrate MUSE's ability to promptly write high-quality responses to potential misinformation on social media-overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality responses from laypeople by 29%. This work reveals LLMs' potential to help combat real-world misinformation effectively and efficiently.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have a surprising failure: when trained on "A has a feature B", they do not generalize to "B is a feature of A", which is termed the Reversal Curse. Even when training with trillions of tokens this issue still appears due to Zipf's law - hence even if we train on the entire internet. This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called reverse training, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing the training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings, such as entities. We show that data-matched reverse-trained models provide superior performance to standard models on standard tasks, and compute-matched reverse-trained models provide far superior performance on reversal tasks, helping resolve the reversal curse issue.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrast agents in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allow to localize tumors and observe their contrast kinetics, which is essential for cancer characterization and respective treatment decision-making. However, contrast agent administration is not only associated with adverse health risks, but also restricted for patients during pregnancy, and for those with kidney malfunction, or other adverse reactions. With contrast uptake as key biomarker for lesion malignancy, cancer recurrence risk, and treatment response, it becomes pivotal to reduce the dependency on intravenous contrast agent administration. To this end, we propose a multi-conditional latent diffusion model capable of acquisition time-conditioned image synthesis of DCE-MRI temporal sequences. To evaluate medical image synthesis, we additionally propose and validate the Fr\'echet radiomics distance as an image quality measure based on biomarker variability between synthetic and real imaging data. Our results demonstrate our method's ability to generate realistic multi-sequence fat-saturated breast DCE-MRI and uncover the emerging potential of deep learning based contrast kinetics simulation. We publicly share our accessible codebase at https://github.com/RichardObi/ccnet and provide a user-friendly library for Fr\'echet radiomics distance calculation at https://pypi.org/project/frd-score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venktesh V, Abhijit Anand, Avishek Anand, Vinay Setty</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated fact checking has gained immense interest to tackle the growing misinformation in the digital era. Existing systems primarily focus on synthetic claims on Wikipedia, and noteworthy progress has also been made on real-world claims. In this work, we release QuanTemp, a diverse, multi-domain dataset focused exclusively on numerical claims, encompassing temporal, statistical and diverse aspects with fine-grained metadata and an evidence collection without leakage. This addresses the challenge of verifying real-world numerical claims, which are complex and often lack precise information, not addressed by existing works that mainly focus on synthetic claims. We evaluate and quantify the limitations of existing solutions for the task of verifying numerical claims. We also evaluate claim decomposition based methods, numerical understanding based models and our best baselines achieves a macro-F1 of 58.32. This demonstrates that QuanTemp serves as a challenging evaluation set for numerical claim verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linchen Qian, Jiasong Chen, Linhai Ma, Timur Urakov, Weiyong Gu, Liang Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lumbar disc degeneration, a progressive structural wear and tear of lumbar intervertebral disc, is regarded as an essential role on low back pain, a significant global health concern. Automated lumbar spine geometry reconstruction from MR images will enable fast measurement of medical parameters to evaluate the lumbar status, in order to determine a suitable treatment. Existing image segmentation-based techniques often generate erroneous segments or unstructured point clouds, unsuitable for medical parameter measurement. In this work, we present $\textit{UNet-DeformSA}$ and $\textit{TransDeformer}$: novel attention-based deep neural networks that reconstruct the geometry of the lumbar spine with high spatial accuracy and mesh correspondence across patients, and we also present a variant of $\textit{TransDeformer}$ for error estimation. Specially, we devise new attention modules with a new attention formula, which integrate image features and tokenized contour features to predict the displacements of the points on a shape template without the need for image segmentation. The deformed template reveals the lumbar spine geometry in an image. Experiment results show that our networks generate artifact-free geometry outputs, and the variant of $\textit{TransDeformer}$ can predict the errors of a reconstructed geometry.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Elsayed, A. Rupam Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep representation learning methods struggle with continual learning, suffering from both catastrophic forgetting of useful units and loss of plasticity, often due to rigid and unuseful units. While many methods address these two issues separately, only a few currently deal with both simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) as a novel approach for the continual learning of representations. UPGD combines gradient updates with perturbations, where it applies smaller modifications to more useful units, protecting them from forgetting, and larger modifications to less useful units, rejuvenating their plasticity. We use a challenging streaming learning setup where continual learning problems have hundreds of non-stationarities and unknown task boundaries. We show that many existing methods suffer from at least one of the issues, predominantly manifested by their decreasing accuracy over tasks. On the other hand, UPGD continues to improve performance and surpasses or is competitive with all methods in all problems. Finally, in extended reinforcement learning experiments with PPO, we show that while Adam exhibits a performance drop after initial learning, UPGD avoids it by addressing both continual learning issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Hager, Romain Deffayet, Jean-Michel Renders, Onno Zoeter, Maarten de Rijke</p>
<p>Abstract: Unbiased learning-to-rank (ULTR) is a well-established framework for learning from user clicks, which are often biased by the ranker collecting the data. While theoretically justified and extensively tested in simulation, ULTR techniques lack empirical validation, especially on modern search engines. The Baidu-ULTR dataset released for the WSDM Cup 2023, collected from Baidu's search engine, offers a rare opportunity to assess the real-world performance of prominent ULTR techniques. Despite multiple submissions during the WSDM Cup 2023 and the subsequent NTCIR ULTRE-2 task, it remains unclear whether the observed improvements stem from applying ULTR or other learning techniques.
  In this work, we revisit and extend the available experiments on the Baidu-ULTR dataset. We find that standard unbiased learning-to-rank techniques robustly improve click predictions but struggle to consistently improve ranking performance, especially considering the stark differences obtained by choice of ranking loss and query-document features. Our experiments reveal that gains in click prediction do not necessarily translate to enhanced ranking performance on expert relevance annotations, implying that conclusions strongly depend on how success is measured in this benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Safouane El Ghazouali, Arnaud Gucciardi, Nicola Venturi, Michael Rueegsegger, Umberto Michelucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection in remotely sensed satellite pictures is fundamental in many fields such as biophysical, and environmental monitoring. While deep learning algorithms are constantly evolving, they have been mostly implemented and tested on popular ground-based taken photos. This paper critically evaluates and compares a suite of advanced object detection algorithms customized for the task of identifying aircraft within satellite imagery. Using the large HRPlanesV2 dataset, together with a rigorous validation with the GDIT dataset, this research encompasses an array of methodologies including YOLO versions 5 and 8, Faster RCNN, CenterNet, RetinaNet, RTMDet, and DETR, all trained from scratch. This exhaustive training and validation study reveal YOLOv5 as the preeminent model for the specific case of identifying airplanes from remote sensing data, showcasing high precision and adaptability across diverse imaging conditions. This research highlight the nuanced performance landscapes of these algorithms, with YOLOv5 emerging as a robust solution for aerial object detection, underlining its importance through superior mean average precision, Recall, and Intersection over Union scores. The findings described here underscore the fundamental role of algorithm selection aligned with the specific demands of satellite imagery analysis and extend a comprehensive framework to evaluate model efficacy. The benchmark toolkit and codes, available via https://github.com/toelt-llc/FlightScope_Bench, aims to further exploration and innovation in the realm of remote sensing object detection, paving the way for improved analytical methodologies in satellite imagery applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Vallstrom</p>
<p>Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Jingyuan Huang, Qingcheng Zeng, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Haiyan Zhao, Kai Mei, Yanda Meng, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of "Concept Depth" to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, QWen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Luckfort/CD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Platnick, Sourena Khanzadeh, Alireza Sadeghian, Richard Anthony Valenzano</p>
<p>Abstract: Microplastic particle ingestion or inhalation by humans is a problem of growing concern. Unfortunately, current research methods that use machine learning to understand their potential harms are obstructed by a lack of available data. Deep learning techniques in particular are challenged by such domains where only small or imbalanced data sets are available. Overcoming this challenge often involves oversampling underrepresented classes or augmenting the existing data to improve model performance. This paper proposes GANsemble: a two-module framework connecting data augmentation with conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to generate class-conditioned synthetic data. First, the data chooser module automates augmentation strategy selection by searching for the best data augmentation strategy. Next, the cGAN module uses this strategy to train a cGAN for generating enhanced synthetic data. We experiment with the GANsemble framework on a small and imbalanced microplastics data set. A Microplastic-cGAN (MPcGAN) algorithm is introduced, and baselines for synthetic microplastics (SYMP) data are established in terms of Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Scores (IS). We also provide a synthetic microplastics filter (SYMP-Filter) algorithm to increase the quality of generated SYMP. Additionally, we show the best amount of oversampling with augmentation to fix class imbalance in small microplastics data sets. To our knowledge, this study is the first application of generative AI to synthetically create microplastics data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Rasetto, Himanshu Akolkar, Ryad Benosman</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, a neuromorphic approach for feature extraction from event data, presents promising capabilities but faces challenges in accuracy and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we introduce Sup3r, a Semi-Supervised algorithm aimed at addressing these challenges. Sup3r enhances sparsity, stability, and separability in the HOTS networks. It enables end-to-end online training of HOTS networks replacing external classifiers, by leveraging semi-supervised learning. Sup3r learns class-informative patterns, mitigates confounding features, and reduces the number of processed events. Moreover, Sup3r facilitates continual and incremental learning, allowing adaptation to data distribution shifts and learning new tasks without forgetting. Preliminary results on N-MNIST demonstrate that Sup3r achieves comparable accuracy to similarly sized Artificial Neural Networks trained with back-propagation. This work showcases the potential of Sup3r to advance the capabilities of HOTS networks, offering a promising avenue for neuromorphic algorithms in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwesha Das, Zekun Wu, Iza \v{S}krjanec, Anna Maria Feit</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual highlighting can guide user attention in complex interfaces. However, its effectiveness under limited attentional capacities is underexplored. This paper examines the joint impact of visual highlighting (permanent and dynamic) and dual-task-induced cognitive load on gaze behaviour. Our analysis, using eye-movement data from 27 participants viewing 150 unique webpages reveals that while participants' ability to attend to UI elements decreases with increasing cognitive load, dynamic adaptations (i.e., highlighting) remain attention-grabbing. The presence of these factors significantly alters what people attend to and thus what is salient. Accordingly, we show that state-of-the-art saliency models increase their performance when accounting for different cognitive loads. Our empirical insights, along with our openly available dataset, enhance our understanding of attentional processes in UIs under varying cognitive (and perceptual) loads and open the door for new models that can predict user attention while multitasking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khai Nguyen, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Tam Sobeih, Lianghao Han, Darren Dancey</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation is crucial for interpreting complex environments, especially in areas such as autonomous vehicle navigation and robotics. Nonetheless, obtaining accurate depth readings from event camera data remains a formidable challenge. Event cameras operate differently from traditional digital cameras, continuously capturing data and generating asynchronous binary spikes that encode time, location, and light intensity. Yet, the unique sampling mechanisms of event cameras render standard image based algorithms inadequate for processing spike data. This necessitates the development of innovative, spike-aware algorithms tailored for event cameras, a task compounded by the irregularity, continuity, noise, and spatial and temporal characteristics inherent in spiking data.Harnessing the strong generalization capabilities of transformer neural networks for spatiotemporal data, we propose a purely spike-driven spike transformer network for depth estimation from spiking camera data. To address performance limitations with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), we introduce a novel single-stage cross-modality knowledge transfer framework leveraging knowledge from a large vision foundational model of artificial neural networks (ANN) (DINOv2) to enhance the performance of SNNs with limited data. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show substantial improvements over existing models, with notable gains in Absolute Relative and Square Relative errors (49% and 39.77% improvements over the benchmark model Spike-T, respectively). Besides accuracy, the proposed model also demonstrates reduced power consumptions, a critical factor for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Cheng, Xinzhi Yu, Haodong Wen, Jingsong Sun, Guanzhang Yue, Yihao Zhang, Zeming Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the mysterious In-Context Learning (ICL) ability exhibited by Transformer architectures, especially in large language models (LLMs), has sparked significant research interest. However, the resilience of Transformers' in-context learning capabilities in the presence of noisy samples, prevalent in both training corpora and prompt demonstrations, remains underexplored. In this paper, inspired by prior research that studies ICL ability using simple function classes, we take a closer look at this problem by investigating the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels. Specifically, we first conduct a thorough evaluation and analysis of the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels during in-context learning and show that they exhibit notable resilience against diverse types of noise in demonstration labels. Furthermore, we delve deeper into this problem by exploring whether introducing noise into the training set, akin to a form of data augmentation, enhances such robustness during inference, and find that such noise can indeed improve the robustness of ICL. Overall, our fruitful analysis and findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of Transformer models against label noises during ICL and provide valuable insights into the research on Transformers in natural language processing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: U-Nets are among the most widely used architectures in computer vision, renowned for their exceptional performance in applications such as image segmentation, denoising, and diffusion modeling. However, a theoretical explanation of the U-Net architecture design has not yet been fully established.
  This paper introduces a novel interpretation of the U-Net architecture by studying certain generative hierarchical models, which are tree-structured graphical models extensively utilized in both language and image domains. With their encoder-decoder structure, long skip connections, and pooling and up-sampling layers, we demonstrate how U-Nets can naturally implement the belief propagation denoising algorithm in such generative hierarchical models, thereby efficiently approximating the denoising functions. This leads to an efficient sample complexity bound for learning the denoising function using U-Nets within these models. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of these findings for diffusion models in generative hierarchical models. We also demonstrate that the conventional architecture of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) is ideally suited for classification tasks within these models. This offers a unified view of the roles of ConvNets and U-Nets, highlighting the versatility of generative hierarchical models in modeling complex data distributions across language and image domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple privacy-sensitive applications to leverage their dataset for a global model construction without any disclosure of the information. One of those domains is healthcare, where groups of silos collaborate in order to generate a global predictor with improved accuracy and generalization. However, the inherent challenge lies in the high heterogeneity of medical data, necessitating sophisticated techniques for assessment and compensation. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the mathematical formalization and taxonomy of heterogeneity within FL environments, focusing on the intricacies of medical data. In particular, we address the evaluation and comparison of the most popular FL algorithms with respect to their ability to cope with quantity-based, feature and label distribution-based heterogeneity. The goal is to provide a quantitative evaluation of the impact of data heterogeneity in FL systems for healthcare networks as well as a guideline on FL algorithm selection. Our research extends beyond existing studies by benchmarking seven of the most common FL algorithms against the unique challenges posed by medical data use cases. The paper targets the prediction of the risk of stroke recurrence through a set of tabular clinical reports collected by different federated hospital silos: data heterogeneity frequently encountered in this scenario and its impact on FL performance are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more advanced, they have outpaced our abilities to accurately evaluate their quality. Not only is finding data to adequately probe particular model properties difficult, but evaluating the correctness of a model's freeform generation alone is a challenge. To address this, many evaluations now rely on using LLMs themselves as judges to score the quality of outputs from other LLMs. Evaluations most commonly use a single large model like GPT4. While this method has grown in popularity, it is costly, has been shown to introduce intramodel bias, and in this work, we find that very large models are often unnecessary. We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL). Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.</p>
