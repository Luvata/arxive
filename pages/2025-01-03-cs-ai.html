<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixian Shen, Hang Zhang, Yanxin Shen, Lun Wang, Chuanqi Shi, Shaoshuai Du, Yiyi Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital accessibility is a cornerstone of inclusive content delivery, yet many EPUB files fail to meet fundamental accessibility standards, particularly in providing descriptive alt text for images. Alt text plays a critical role in enabling visually impaired users to understand visual content through assistive technologies. However, generating high-quality alt text at scale is a resource-intensive process, creating significant challenges for organizations aiming to ensure accessibility compliance. This paper introduces AltGen, a novel AI-driven pipeline designed to automate the generation of alt text for images in EPUB files. By integrating state-of-the-art generative models, including advanced transformer-based architectures, AltGen achieves contextually relevant and linguistically coherent alt text descriptions. The pipeline encompasses multiple stages, starting with data preprocessing to extract and prepare relevant content, followed by visual analysis using computer vision models such as CLIP and ViT. The extracted visual features are enriched with contextual information from surrounding text, enabling the fine-tuned language models to generate descriptive and accurate alt text. Validation of the generated output employs both quantitative metrics, such as cosine similarity and BLEU scores, and qualitative feedback from visually impaired users.
  Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of AltGen across diverse datasets, achieving a 97.5% reduction in accessibility errors and high scores in similarity and linguistic fidelity metrics. User studies highlight the practical impact of AltGen, with participants reporting significant improvements in document usability and comprehension. Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal that AltGen outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, relevance, and scalability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00154">Probabilistic Explanations for Linear Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernardo Subercaseaux, Marcelo Arenas, Kuldeep S Meel</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal XAI is an emerging field that focuses on providing explanations with mathematical guarantees for the decisions made by machine learning models. A significant amount of work in this area is centered on the computation of "sufficient reasons". Given a model $M$ and an input instance $\vec{x}$, a sufficient reason for the decision $M(\vec{x})$ is a subset $S$ of the features of $\vec{x}$ such that for any instance $\vec{z}$ that has the same values as $\vec{x}$ for every feature in $S$, it holds that $M(\vec{x}) = M(\vec{z})$. Intuitively, this means that the features in $S$ are sufficient to fully justify the classification of $\vec{x}$ by $M$. For sufficient reasons to be useful in practice, they should be as small as possible, and a natural way to reduce the size of sufficient reasons is to consider a probabilistic relaxation; the probability of $M(\vec{x}) = M(\vec{z})$ must be at least some value $\delta \in (0,1]$, for a random instance $\vec{z}$ that coincides with $\vec{x}$ on the features in $S$. Computing small $\delta$-sufficient reasons ($\delta$-SRs) is known to be a theoretically hard problem; even over decision trees--traditionally deemed simple and interpretable models--strong inapproximability results make the efficient computation of small $\delta$-SRs unlikely. We propose the notion of $(\delta, \epsilon)$-SR, a simple relaxation of $\delta$-SRs, and show that this kind of explanation can be computed efficiently over linear models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Gubanov, Anna Pyayt, Aleksandra Karolak</p>
<p>Abstract: Here, we describe one of the first Web-scale hybrid Knowledge Graph (KG)-Large Language Model (LLM), populated with the latest peer-reviewed medical knowledge on colorectal Cancer. It is currently being evaluated to assist with both medical research and clinical information retrieval tasks at Moffitt Cancer Center, which is one of the top Cancer centers in the U.S. and in the world. Our hybrid is remarkable as it serves the user needs better than just an LLM, KG or a search-engine in isolation. LLMs as is are known to exhibit hallucinations and catastrophic forgetting as well as are trained on outdated corpora. The state of the art KGs, such as PrimeKG, cBioPortal, ChEMBL, NCBI, and other require manual curation, hence are quickly getting stale. CancerKG is unsupervised and is capable of automatically ingesting and organizing the latest medical findings. To alleviate the LLMs shortcomings, the verified KG serves as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) guardrail. CancerKG exhibits 5 different advanced user interfaces, each tailored to serve different data modalities better and more convenient for the user.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00226">Generative Emergent Communication: Large Language Model is a Collective World Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tadahiro Taniguchi, Ryo Ueda, Tomoaki Nakamura, Masahiro Suzuki, Akira Taniguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a unifying theoretical framework called generative emergent communication (generative EmCom) that bridges emergent communication, world models, and large language models (LLMs) through the lens of collective predictive coding (CPC). The proposed framework formalizes the emergence of language and symbol systems through decentralized Bayesian inference across multiple agents, extending beyond conventional discriminative model-based approaches to emergent communication. This study makes the following two key contributions: First, we propose generative EmCom as a novel framework for understanding emergent communication, demonstrating how communication emergence in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be derived from control as inference while clarifying its relationship to conventional discriminative approaches. Second, we propose a mathematical formulation showing the interpretation of LLMs as collective world models that integrate multiple agents' experiences through CPC. The framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how shared symbol systems emerge through collective predictive coding processes, bridging individual cognitive development and societal language evolution. Through mathematical formulations and discussion on prior works, we demonstrate how this framework explains fundamental aspects of language emergence and offers practical insights for understanding LLMs and developing sophisticated AI systems for improving human-AI interaction and multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The number of parameters in large-scale language models based on transformers is gradually increasing, and the scale of computing clusters is also growing. The technology of quickly mobilizing large amounts of computing resources for parallel computing is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we propose an automatic parallel algorithm that automatically plans the parallel strategy with maximum throughput based on model and hardware information. By decoupling the training time into computation, communication, and overlap, we established a training duration simulation model. Based on this simulation model, we prune the parallel solution space to shorten the search time required. The multi-node experiment results show that the algorithm can estimate the parallel training duration in real time with an average accuracy of 96%. In our test, the recommendation strategy provided by the algorithm is always globally optimal.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00320">Autonomous Alignment with Human Value on Altruism through Considerate Self-imagination and Theory of Mind</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibo Tong, Enmeng Lum, Yinqian Sun, Zhengqiang Han, Chao Liu, Feifei Zhao, Yi Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in human society, enabling AI to autonomously align with human values has become a pressing issue to ensure its sustainable development and benefit to humanity. One of the most important aspects of aligning with human values is the necessity for agents to autonomously make altruistic, safe, and ethical decisions, considering and caring for human well-being. Current AI extremely pursues absolute superiority in certain tasks, remaining indifferent to the surrounding environment and other agents, which has led to numerous safety risks. Altruistic behavior in human society originates from humans' capacity for empathizing others, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), combined with predictive imaginative interactions before taking action to produce thoughtful and altruistic behaviors. Inspired by this, we are committed to endow agents with considerate self-imagination and ToM capabilities, driving them through implicit intrinsic motivations to autonomously align with human altruistic values. By integrating ToM within the imaginative space, agents keep an eye on the well-being of other agents in real time, proactively anticipate potential risks to themselves and others, and make thoughtful altruistic decisions that balance negative effects on the environment. The ancient Chinese story of Sima Guang Smashes the Vat illustrates the moral behavior of the young Sima Guang smashed a vat to save a child who had accidentally fallen into it, which is an excellent reference scenario for this paper. We design an experimental scenario similar to Sima Guang Smashes the Vat and its variants with different complexities, which reflects the trade-offs and comprehensive considerations between self-goals, altruistic rescue, and avoiding negative side effects.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00364">$\texttt{FORM}$: Learning Expressive and Transferable First-Order Logic Reward Machines</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo Ardon, Daniel Furelos-Blanco, Roko Para\'c, Alessandra Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are an effective approach for addressing non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL) through finite-state machines. Traditional RMs, which label edges with propositional logic formulae, inherit the limited expressivity of propositional logic. This limitation hinders the learnability and transferability of RMs since complex tasks will require numerous states and edges. To overcome these challenges, we propose First-Order Reward Machines ($\texttt{FORM}$s), which use first-order logic to label edges, resulting in more compact and transferable RMs. We introduce a novel method for $\textbf{learning}$ $\texttt{FORM}$s and a multi-agent formulation for $\textbf{exploiting}$ them and facilitate their transferability, where multiple agents collaboratively learn policies for a shared $\texttt{FORM}$. Our experimental results demonstrate the scalability of $\texttt{FORM}$s with respect to traditional RMs. Specifically, we show that $\texttt{FORM}$s can be effectively learnt for tasks where traditional RM learning approaches fail. We also show significant improvements in learning speed and task transferability thanks to the multi-agent learning framework and the abstraction provided by the first-order language.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00444">Knowledge-aware equation discovery with automated background knowledge extraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizaveta Ivanchik, Alexander Hvatov</p>
<p>Abstract: In differential equation discovery algorithms, a priori expert knowledge is mainly used implicitly to constrain the form of the expected equation, making it impossible for the algorithm to truly discover equations. Instead, most differential equation discovery algorithms try to recover the coefficients for a known structure. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that allows the discovery of unknown equations using automatically or manually extracted background knowledge. Instead of imposing rigid constraints, we modify the structure space so that certain terms are likely to appear within the crossover and mutation operators. In this way, we mimic expertly chosen terms while preserving the possibility of obtaining any equation form. The paper shows that the extraction and use of knowledge allows it to outperform the SINDy algorithm in terms of search stability and robustness. Synthetic examples are given for Burgers, wave, and Korteweg--De Vries equations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00461">Efficient support ticket resolution using Knowledge Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sherwin Varghese, James Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: A review of over 160,000 customer cases indicates that about 90% of time is spent by the product support for solving around 10% of subset of tickets where a trivial solution may not exist. Many of these challenging cases require the support of several engineers working together within a "swarm", and some also need to go to development support as bugs. These challenging customer issues represent a major opportunity for machine learning and knowledge graph that identifies the ideal engineer / group of engineers(swarm) that can best address the solution, reducing the wait times for the customer. The concrete ML task we consider here is a learning-to-rank(LTR) task that given an incident and a set of engineers currently assigned to the incident (which might be the empty set in the non-swarming context), produce a ranked list of engineers best fit to help resolve that incident. To calculate the rankings, we may consider a wide variety of input features including the incident description provided by the customer, the affected component(s), engineer ratings of their expertise, knowledge base article text written by engineers, response to customer text written by engineers, and historic swarming data. The central hypothesis test is that by including a holistic set of contextual data around which cases an engineer has solved, we can significantly improve the LTR algorithm over benchmark models. The article proposes a novel approach of modelling Knowledge Graph embeddings from multiple data sources, including the swarm information. The results obtained proves that by incorporating this additional context, we can improve the recommendations significantly over traditional machine learning methods like TF-IDF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amira Jemaa, Adnan Rashid, Sofiene Tahar</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays an important role in improving the transparency and reliability of complex machine learning models, especially in critical domains such as cybersecurity. Despite the prevalence of heuristic interpretation methods such as SHAP and LIME, these techniques often lack formal guarantees and may produce inconsistent local explanations. To fulfill this need, few tools have emerged that use formal methods to provide formal explanations. Among these, XReason uses a SAT solver to generate formal instance-level explanation for XGBoost models. In this paper, we extend the XReason tool to support LightGBM models as well as class-level explanations. Additionally, we implement a mechanism to generate and detect adversarial examples in XReason. We evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach on the CICIDS-2017 dataset, a widely used benchmark for detecting network attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Szeider</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceptionally well at natural language tasks, they often struggle with precise formal reasoning and the rigorous specification of problems. We present MCP-Solver, a prototype implementation of the Model Context Protocol that demonstrates the potential for systematic integration between LLMs and constraint programming systems. Our implementation provides interfaces for the creation, editing, and validation of a constraint model. Through an item-based editing approach with integrated validation, the system ensures model consistency at every modification step and enables structured iterative refinement. The system handles concurrent solving sessions and maintains a persistent knowledge base of modeling insights. Initial experiments suggest that this integration can effectively combine LLMs' natural language understanding with constraint-solving capabilities. Our open-source implementation is proof of concept for integrating formal reasoning systems with LLMs through standardized protocols. While further research is needed to establish comprehensive formal guarantees, this work takes a first step toward principled integration of natural language processing with constraint-based reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phuc Nguyen, Miao Li, Alexandra Morgan, Rima Arnaout, Ramy Arnaout</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models hold great potential, but only if one can trust the evaluation of the data they generate. We show that many commonly used quality scores for comparing two-dimensional distributions of synthetic vs. ground-truth data give better results than they should, a phenomenon we call the "grade inflation problem." We show that the correlation score, Jaccard score, earth-mover's score, and Kullback-Leibler (relative-entropy) score all suffer grade inflation. We propose that any score that values all datapoints equally, as these do, will also exhibit grade inflation; we refer to such scores as "equipoint" scores. We introduce the concept of "equidensity" scores, and present the Eden score, to our knowledge the first example of such a score. We found that Eden avoids grade inflation and agrees better with human perception of goodness-of-fit than the equipoint scores above. We propose that any reasonable equidensity score will avoid grade inflation. We identify a connection between equidensity scores and R\'enyi entropy of negative order. We conclude that equidensity scores are likely to outperform equipoint scores for generative models, and for comparing low-dimensional distributions more generally.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study proposes the design and implementation of a multimodal LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) leveraging a No-Code platform to address the practical constraints and significant entry barriers associated with AI adoption in enterprises. Advanced AI technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), often pose challenges due to their technical complexity and high implementation costs, making them difficult for many organizations to adopt. To overcome these limitations, this research develops a No-Code-based Multi-Agent System designed to enable users without programming knowledge to easily build and manage AI systems. The study examines various use cases to validate the applicability of AI in business processes, including code generation from image-based notes, Advanced RAG-based question-answering systems, text-based image generation, and video generation using images and prompts. These systems lower the barriers to AI adoption, empowering not only professional developers but also general users to harness AI for significantly improved productivity and efficiency. By demonstrating the scalability and accessibility of No-Code platforms, this study advances the democratization of AI technologies within enterprises and validates the practical applicability of Multi-Agent Systems, ultimately contributing to the widespread adoption of AI across various industries.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI agents have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, driven by significant advancements in the field of large language models (LLMs). Mobile GUI agents, a subset of AI agents, are designed to autonomously perform tasks on mobile devices. While numerous studies have introduced agents, datasets, and benchmarks to advance mobile GUI agent research, many existing datasets focus on static frame evaluations and fail to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing performance on real-world, in-the-wild tasks. To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel evaluation platform. Unlike existing in-the-wild systems, A3 offers: (1) meaningful and practical tasks, such as real-time online information retrieval and operational instructions; (2) a larger, more flexible action space, enabling compatibility with agents trained on any dataset; and (3) automated business-level LLM-based evaluation process. A3 includes 21 widely used general third-party apps and 201 tasks representative of common user scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating mobile GUI agents in real-world situations and a new autonomous evaluation process for less human labor and coding expertise.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej Mihel\v{c}i\'c, Ivan Grubi\v{s}i\'c, Miha Keber</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models (DLMs) achieve increasingly high performance both on structured and unstructured data. They significantly extended applicability of machine learning to various domains. Their success in making predictions, detecting patterns and generating new data made significant impact on science and industry. Despite these accomplishments, DLMs are difficult to explain because of their enormous size. In this work, we propose a novel framework for post-hoc explaining and relating DLMs using redescriptions. The framework allows cohort analysis of arbitrary DLMs by identifying statistically significant redescriptions of neuron activations. It allows coupling neurons to a set of target labels or sets of descriptive attributes, relating layers within a single DLM or associating different DLMs. The proposed framework is independent of the artificial neural network architecture and can work with more complex target labels (e.g. multi-label or multi-target scenario). Additionally, it can emulate both pedagogical and decompositional approach to rule extraction. The aforementioned properties of the proposed framework can increase explainability and interpretability of arbitrary DLMs by providing different information compared to existing explainable-AI approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced human-AI interaction but struggle with cultural understanding, often misinterpreting symbols, gestures, and artifacts due to biases in predominantly Western-centric training data. In this paper, we construct CultureVerse, a large-scale multimodal benchmark covering 19, 682 cultural concepts, 188 countries/regions, 15 cultural concepts, and 3 question types, with the aim of characterizing and improving VLMs' multicultural understanding capabilities. Then, we propose CultureVLM, a series of VLMs fine-tuned on our dataset to achieve significant performance improvement in cultural understanding. Our evaluation of 16 models reveals significant disparities, with a stronger performance in Western concepts and weaker results in African and Asian contexts. Fine-tuning on our CultureVerse enhances cultural perception, demonstrating cross-cultural, cross-continent, and cross-dataset generalization without sacrificing performance on models' general VLM benchmarks. We further present insights on cultural generalization and forgetting. We hope that this work could lay the foundation for more equitable and culturally aware multimodal AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Han Huang, Argyrios Gerogiannis, Subhonmesh Bose, Venugopal V. Veeravalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Zhichao Chen, Licheng Pan, Xiaoyu Jiang, Yichen Song, Qunshan He, Xinggao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective process monitoring is increasingly vital in industrial automation for ensuring operational safety, necessitating both high accuracy and efficiency. Although Transformers have demonstrated success in various fields, their canonical form based on the self-attention mechanism is inadequate for process monitoring due to two primary limitations: (1) the step-wise correlations captured by self-attention mechanism are difficult to capture discriminative patterns in monitoring logs due to the lacking semantics of each step, thus compromising accuracy; (2) the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention hampers efficiency. To address these issues, we propose DeepFilter, a Transformer-style framework for process monitoring. The core innovation is an efficient filtering layer that excel capturing long-term and periodic patterns with reduced complexity. Equipping with the global filtering layer, DeepFilter enhances both accuracy and efficiency, meeting the stringent demands of process monitoring. Experimental results on real-world process monitoring datasets validate DeepFilter's superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang He, Yougang Chu, Zhen Wu, Jianbing Zhang, Xinyu Dai, Jiajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating machine learning algorithm performance, facilitating comparison and identifying superior solutions. However, biases within datasets can lead models to learn shortcut patterns, resulting in inaccurate assessments and hindering real-world applicability. This paper addresses the issue of entity bias in relation extraction tasks, where models tend to rely on entity mentions rather than context. We propose a debiased relation extraction benchmark DREB that breaks the pseudo-correlation between entity mentions and relation types through entity replacement. DREB utilizes Bias Evaluator and PPL Evaluator to ensure low bias and high naturalness, providing a reliable and accurate assessment of model generalization in entity bias scenarios. To establish a new baseline on DREB, we introduce MixDebias, a debiasing method combining data-level and model training-level techniques. MixDebias effectively improves model performance on DREB while maintaining performance on the original dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MixDebias compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for improving the generalization ability of relation extraction models. We will release DREB and MixDebias publicly.</p>

In this work, we present NewsHomepages, a large dataset of over 3,000 new website homepages (including local, national and topic-specific outlets) captured twice daily over a three-year period. We develop models to perform pairwise comparisons between news items to infer their relative significance. To illustrate that modeling organizational hierarchies has broader implications, we applied our models to rank-order a collection of local city council policies passed over a ten-year period in San Francisco, assessing their "newsworthiness". Our findings lay the groundwork for leveraging implicit organizational cues to deepen our understanding of information prioritization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengheng Liu, Xingkang Li, Zihuan Mao, Peng Liu, Yongming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: High-accuracy positioning has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent connected devices. Nevertheless, the present wireless networks still rely on model-driven approaches to achieve positioning functionality, which are susceptible to performance degradation in practical scenarios, primarily due to hardware impairments. Integrating artificial intelligence into the positioning framework presents a promising solution to revolutionize the accuracy and robustness of location-based services. In this study, we address this challenge by reformulating the problem of angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation into image reconstruction of spatial spectrum. To this end, we design a model-driven deep neural network (MoD-DNN), which can automatically calibrate the angular-dependent phase error. The proposed MoD-DNN approach employs an iterative optimization scheme between a convolutional neural network and a sparse conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing spectrum calibration and AoA estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lirong Wu, Haitao Lin, Yufei Huang, Zhangyang Gao, Cheng Tan, Yunfan Liu, Tailin Wu, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that protect the host by binding to specific antigens, and their binding is mainly determined by the Complementary Determining Regions (CDRs) in the antibody. Despite the great progress made in CDR design, existing computational methods still encounter several challenges: 1) poor capability of modeling complex CDRs with long sequences due to insufficient contextual information; 2) conditioned on pre-given antigenic epitopes and their static interaction with the target antibody; 3) neglect of specificity during antibody optimization leads to non-specific antibodies. In this paper, we take into account a variety of node features, edge features, and edge relations to include more contextual and geometric information. We propose a novel Relation-Aware Antibody Design (RAAD) framework, which dynamically models antigen-antibody interactions for co-designing the sequences and structures of antigen-specific CDRs. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation metric to better measure antibody specificity and develop a contrasting specificity-enhancing constraint to optimize the specificity of antibodies. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior capability of RAAD in terms of antibody modeling, generation, and optimization across different CDR types, sequence lengths, pre-training strategies, and input contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phase-field modeling reformulates fracture problems as energy minimization problems and enables a comprehensive characterization of the fracture process, including crack nucleation, propagation, merging, and branching, without relying on ad-hoc assumptions. However, the numerical solution of phase-field fracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet) consisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture problems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network configurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a two-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In the second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the mathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network's loss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results in a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third approach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model crack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end displacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single edge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and shear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields accurately, and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibakar Gope, David Mansell, Danny Loh, Ian Bratt</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we think about language understanding and generation, enthralling both researchers and developers. However, deploying LLMs for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented size and resource requirements. While quantizing model weights to sub-byte precision has emerged as a promising solution to ease memory pressure, the group quantization formats commonly used for LLM quantization have significant compute overheads and a resource-intensive dequantization process. As a result, a higher proportion of compute instructions do not perform multiplies, i.e., real work, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the required latency requirements for LLMs deployed on commodity CPUs. In this work, we propose a set of highly optimized kernels to accelerate LLM inference and unleash the full potential of CPUs, particularly Arm CPUs. These kernels amortize the cost of loading the operands and the cost of weight unpacking across multiple output rows. This, along with the introduction of an optimized interleaved group data layout for weights and decompression path optimizations to reduce unnecessary operations and dequantization overhead while maximizing the use of vector and matrix multiply operations, significantly improves the efficiency of MAC operations. Furthermore, we present a groupwise non-uniform codebook-based quantization method for ultra-low-precision quantization of LLMs to better match non-uniform patterns in their weight distributions, demonstrating better throughput during token generation while ensuring better quality than the state-of-the-art. Applying these improvements to 4-bit LLMs results in a 3-3.2x improvement in prompt processing and a 2x improvement in autoregressive decoding on Arm CPUs, compared to LLaMA.cpp-based solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Yahe Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of machine learning in financial risk management, conventional wisdom suggests that longer training periods and more feature variables contribute to improved model performance. This paper, focusing on mortgage default prediction, empirically discovers a phenomenon that contradicts traditional knowledge: in time series prediction, increased training data timespan and additional non-critical features actually lead to significant deterioration in prediction effectiveness. Using Fannie Mae's mortgage data, the study compares predictive performance across different time window lengths (2012-2022) and feature combinations, revealing that shorter time windows (such as single-year periods) paired with carefully selected key features yield superior prediction results. The experimental results indicate that extended time spans may introduce noise from historical data and outdated market patterns, while excessive non-critical features interfere with the model's learning of core default factors. This research not only challenges the traditional "more is better" approach in data modeling but also provides new insights and practical guidance for feature selection and time window optimization in financial risk prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper describes a memory-efficient transformer model designed to drive a reduction in memory usage and execution time by substantial orders of magnitude without impairing the model's performance near that of the original model. Recently, new architectures of transformers were presented, focused on parameter efficiency and computational optimization; however, such models usually require considerable resources in terms of hardware when deployed in real-world applications on edge devices. This approach addresses this concern by halving embedding size and applying targeted techniques such as parameter pruning and quantization to optimize the memory footprint with minimum sacrifices in terms of accuracy. Experimental results include a 52% reduction in memory usage and a 33% decrease in execution time, resulting in better efficiency than state-of-the-art models. This work compared our model with existing compelling architectures, such as MobileBERT and DistilBERT, and proved its feasibility in the domain of resource-friendly deep learning architectures, mainly for applications in real-time and in resource-constrained applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Every year in the United States, 800,000 individuals suffer a stroke - one person every 40 seconds, with a death occurring every four minutes. While individual factors vary, certain predictors are more prevalent in determining stroke risk. As strokes are the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide, predicting stroke likelihood based on lifestyle factors is crucial. Showing individuals their stroke risk could motivate lifestyle changes, and machine learning offers solutions to this prediction challenge. Neural networks excel at predicting outcomes based on training features like lifestyle factors, however, they're not the only option. Logistic regression models can also effectively compute the likelihood of binary outcomes based on independent variables, making them well-suited for stroke prediction. This analysis will compare both neural networks (dense and convolutional) and logistic regression models for stroke prediction, examining their pros, cons, and differences to develop the most effective predictor that minimizes false negatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Zheng Lin, Qinxuan Shi, Zhanglong Yang, Banafsheh Saber Latibari, Sicong Shao, Soheil Salehi, Pratik Satam</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach to simulate, predict, and optimize the behavior of physical systems, with applications that span manufacturing, healthcare, climate science, and more. However, the development of DT models often faces challenges such as high data requirements, integration complexity, and limited adaptability to dynamic changes in physical systems. This paper presents a new method inspired by dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS), called the dynamic data-driven generative of digital twins framework (DDD-GenDT), which combines the physical system with LLM, allowing LLM to act as DT to interact with the physical system operating status and generate the corresponding physical behaviors. We apply DDD-GenDT to the computer numerical control (CNC) machining process, and we use the spindle current measurement data in the NASA milling wear data set as an example to enable LLMs to forecast the physical behavior from historical data and interact with current observations. Experimental results show that in the zero-shot prediction setting, the LLM-based DT can adapt to the change in the system, and the average RMSE of the GPT-4 prediction is 0.479A, which is 4.79% of the maximum spindle motor current measurement of 10A, with little training data and instructions required. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of DDD-GenDT in this specific application and their potential to construct digital twins. We also discuss the limitations and challenges that may arise in practical implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoge Zhang, Tao Wang, Chao Yan, Fedaa Najdawi, Kai Zhou, Yuan Ma, Yiu-ming Cheung, Bradley A. Malin</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring trustworthiness is fundamental to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) that is considered societally responsible, particularly in cancer diagnostics, where a misdiagnosis can have dire consequences. Current digital pathology AI models lack systematic solutions to address trustworthiness concerns arising from model limitations and data discrepancies between model deployment and development environments. To address this issue, we developed TRUECAM, a framework designed to ensure both data and model trustworthiness in non-small cell lung cancer subtyping with whole-slide images. TRUECAM integrates 1) a spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process for identifying out-of-scope inputs and 2) an ambiguity-guided elimination of tiles to filter out highly ambiguous regions, addressing data trustworthiness, as well as 3) conformal prediction to ensure controlled error rates. We systematically evaluated the framework across multiple large-scale cancer datasets, leveraging both task-specific and foundation models, illustrate that an AI model wrapped with TRUECAM significantly outperforms models that lack such guidance, in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency, while also achieving improvements in fairness. These findings highlight TRUECAM as a versatile wrapper framework for digital pathology AI models with diverse architectural designs, promoting their responsible and effective applications in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Security concerns surrounding text-to-image diffusion models have driven researchers to unlearn inappropriate concepts through fine-tuning. Recent fine-tuning methods typically align the prediction distributions of unsafe prompts with those of predefined text anchors. However, these techniques exhibit a considerable performance trade-off between eliminating undesirable concepts and preserving other concepts. In this paper, we systematically analyze the impact of diverse text anchors on unlearning performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose AdvAnchor, a novel approach that generates adversarial anchors to alleviate the trade-off issue. These adversarial anchors are crafted to closely resemble the embeddings of undesirable concepts to maintain overall model performance, while selectively excluding defining attributes of these concepts for effective erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AdvAnchor.</p>

<p>Abstract: While safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as the cornerstone for powerful systems such as multi-agent frameworks to solve complex real-world problems, they still suffer from potential adversarial queries, such as jailbreak attacks, which attempt to induce harmful content. Researching attack methods allows us to better understand the limitations of LLM and make trade-offs between helpfulness and safety. However, existing jailbreak attacks are primarily based on opaque optimization techniques (e.g. token-level gradient descent) and heuristic search methods like LLM refinement, which fall short in terms of transparency, transferability, and computational cost. In light of these limitations, we draw inspiration from the evolution and infection processes of biological viruses and propose LLM-Virus, a jailbreak attack method based on evolutionary algorithm, termed evolutionary jailbreak. LLM-Virus treats jailbreak attacks as both an evolutionary and transfer learning problem, utilizing LLMs as heuristic evolutionary operators to ensure high attack efficiency, transferability, and low time cost. Our experimental results on multiple safety benchmarks show that LLM-Virus achieves competitive or even superior performance compared to existing attack methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed R. Ibrahim, Terry Lyons</p>
<p>Abstract: Air pollution in cities, especially NO\textsubscript{2}, is linked to numerous health problems, ranging from mortality to mental health challenges and attention deficits in children. While cities globally have initiated policies to curtail emissions, real-time monitoring remains challenging due to limited environmental sensors and their inconsistent distribution. This gap hinders the creation of adaptive urban policies that respond to the sequence of events and daily activities affecting pollution in cities. Here, we demonstrate how city CCTV cameras can act as a pseudo-NO\textsubscript{2} sensors. Using a predictive graph deep model, we utilised traffic flow from London's cameras in addition to environmental and spatial factors, generating NO\textsubscript{2} predictions from over 133 million frames. Our analysis of London's mobility patterns unveiled critical spatiotemporal connections, showing how specific traffic patterns affect NO\textsubscript{2} levels, sometimes with temporal lags of up to 6 hours. For instance, if trucks only drive at night, their effects on NO\textsubscript{2} levels are most likely to be seen in the morning when people commute. These findings cast doubt on the efficacy of some of the urban policies currently being implemented to reduce pollution. By leveraging existing camera infrastructure and our introduced methods, city planners and policymakers could cost-effectively monitor and mitigate the impact of NO\textsubscript{2} and other pollutants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Witold Wydma\'nski, Ulvi Movsum-zada, Jacek Tabor, Marek \'Smieja</p>
<p>Abstract: Although deep learning models have had great success in natural language processing and computer vision, we do not observe comparable improvements in the case of tabular data, which is still the most common data type used in biological, industrial and financial applications. In particular, it is challenging to transfer large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks defined on small tabular datasets. To address this, we propose VisTabNet -- a cross-modal transfer learning method, which allows for adapting Vision Transformer (ViT) with pre-trained weights to process tabular data. By projecting tabular inputs to patch embeddings acceptable by ViT, we can directly apply a pre-trained Transformer Encoder to tabular inputs. This approach eliminates the conceptual cost of designing a suitable architecture for processing tabular data, while reducing the computational cost of training the model from scratch. Experimental results on multiple small tabular datasets (less than 1k samples) demonstrate VisTabNet's superiority, outperforming both traditional ensemble methods and recent deep learning models. The proposed method goes beyond conventional transfer learning practice and shows that pre-trained image models can be transferred to solve tabular problems, extending the boundaries of transfer learning.</p>

While extensive research has focused on mathematical problem-solving, most existing work and datasets concentrate on computational tasks, leaving gaps in areas like mathematical analysis, which demands rigorous proofs and formal reasoning. We developed the DEMI-MathAnalysis dataset, comprising proof-based problems from mathematical analysis topics such as Sequences and Limits, Infinite Series, and Convex Functions. We also designed a guiding framework to rigorously enhance LLMs' ability to solve these problems. Through fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset and employing our framework, we observed significant improvements in their capability to generate logical, complete, and elegant proofs. This work addresses critical gaps in mathematical reasoning and contributes to advancing trustworthy AI capable of handling formalized mathematical language.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengqi Xu, Han Zheng, Jie Song, Li Sun, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has attracted significant attention as a powerful paradigm for model reuse, facilitating the integration of task-specific models into a singular, versatile framework endowed with multifarious capabilities. Previous studies, predominantly utilizing methods such as Weight Average (WA), have shown that model merging can effectively leverage pretrained models without the need for laborious retraining. However, the inherent heterogeneity among models poses a substantial constraint on its applicability, particularly when confronted with discrepancies in model architectures. To overcome this challenge, we propose an innovative model merging framework designed for heterogeneous models, encompassing both depth and width heterogeneity. To address depth heterogeneity, we introduce a layer alignment strategy that harmonizes model layers by segmenting deeper models, treating consecutive layers with similar representations as a cohesive segment, thus enabling the seamless merging of models with differing layer depths. For width heterogeneity, we propose a novel elastic neuron zipping algorithm that projects the weights from models of varying widths onto a common dimensional space, eliminating the need for identical widths. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of these proposed methods, demonstrating that the merging of structurally heterogeneous models can achieve performance levels comparable to those of homogeneous merging, across both vision and NLP tasks.

<p>Abstract: Bidirectional transformers excel at sentiment analysis, and Large Language Models (LLM) are effective zero-shot learners. Might they perform better as a team? This paper explores collaborative approaches between ELECTRA and GPT-4o for three-way sentiment classification. We fine-tuned (FT) four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o/4o-mini) using a mix of reviews from Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and DynaSent. We provided input from ELECTRA to GPT as: predicted label, probabilities, and retrieved examples. Sharing ELECTRA Base FT predictions with GPT-4o-mini significantly improved performance over either model alone (82.74 macro F1 vs. 79.29 ELECTRA Base FT, 79.52 GPT-4o-mini) and yielded the lowest cost/performance ratio (\$0.12/F1 point). However, when GPT models were fine-tuned, including predictions decreased performance. GPT-4o FT-M was the top performer (86.99), with GPT-4o-mini FT close behind (86.77) at much less cost (\$0.38 vs. \$1.59/F1 point). Our results show that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient way to boost performance, and a fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini is nearly as good as GPT-4o FT at 76% less cost. Both are affordable options for projects with limited resources.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00063">&quot;Generative Models for Financial Time Series Data: Enhancing Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Addressing Data Scarcity in A-Share Market</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Che</p>
<p>Abstract: The financial industry is increasingly seeking robust methods to address the challenges posed by data scarcity and low signal-to-noise ratios, which limit the application of deep learning techniques in stock market analysis. This paper presents two innovative generative model-based approaches to synthesize stock data, specifically tailored for different scenarios within the A-share market in China. The first method, a sector-based synthesis approach, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of stock data by classifying the characteristics of stocks from various sectors in China's A-share market. This method employs an Approximate Non-Local Total Variation algorithm to smooth the generated data, a bandpass filtering method based on Fourier Transform to eliminate noise, and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models to accelerate sampling speed. The second method, a recursive stock data synthesis approach based on pattern recognition, is designed to synthesize data for stocks with short listing periods and limited comparable companies. It leverages pattern recognition techniques and Markov models to learn and generate variable-length stock sequences, while introducing a sub-time-level data augmentation method to alleviate data scarcity issues.We validate the effectiveness of these methods through extensive experiments on various datasets, including those from the main board, STAR Market, Growth Enterprise Market Board, Beijing Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX. The results demonstrate that our synthesized data not only improve the performance of predictive models but also enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of individual stock signals in price trading strategies. Furthermore, the introduction of sub-time-level data significantly improves the quality of synthesized data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Yu Ji, Cong Xia, Wen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Predicting children's future levels of externalizing problems helps to identify children at risk and guide targeted prevention. Existing studies have shown that mothers providing support in response to children's dysregulation was associated with children's lower levels of externalizing problems. The current study aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy of predicting children's externalizing problems with mother-child interaction dynamics. Method: This study used mother-child interaction dynamics during a challenging puzzle task to predict children's externalizing problems six months later (N=101, 46 boys, Mage=57.41 months, SD=6.58). Performance of the Residual Dynamic Structural Equation Model (RDSEM) was compared with the Attention-based Sequential Behavior Interaction Modeling (ASBIM) model, developed using the deep learning techniques. Results: The RDSEM revealed that children whose mothers provided more autonomy support after increases of child defeat had lower levels of externalizing problems. Five-fold cross-validation showed that the RDSEM had good prediction accuracy. The ASBIM model further improved prediction accuracy, especially after including child inhibitory control as a personalized individual feature. Conclusions: The dynamic process of mother-child interaction provides important information for predicting children's externalizing problems, especially maternal autonomy supportive response to child defeat. The deep learning model is a useful tool to further improve prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohdan Turbal, Anastasiia Mazur, Jiaxu Zhao, Mykola Pechenizkiy</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the adversarial robustness of LLMs in transfer learning scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (MBIB Hate Speech, MBIB Political Bias, MBIB Gender Bias) and various model architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, Gemma, Phi), we reveal that transfer learning, while improving standard performance metrics, often leads to increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Our findings demonstrate that larger models exhibit greater resilience to this phenomenon, suggesting a complex interplay between model size, architecture, and adaptation methods. Our work highlights the crucial need for considering adversarial robustness in transfer learning scenarios and provides insights into maintaining model security without compromising performance. These findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs in real-world applications where both performance and robustness are paramount.</p>

<p>Abstract: The article describes an attempt to apply an ensemble of binary classifiers to solve the problem of speech assessment in medicine. A dataset was compiled based on quantitative and expert assessments of syllable pronunciation quality. Quantitative assessments of 7 selected metrics were used as features: dynamic time warp distance, Minkowski distance, correlation coefficient, longest common subsequence (LCSS), edit distance of real se-quence (EDR), edit distance with real penalty (ERP), and merge split (MSM). Expert as-sessment of pronunciation quality was used as a class label: class 1 means high-quality speech, class 0 means distorted. A comparison of training results was carried out for five classification methods: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The results of using the mixture method to build an ensemble of classifiers are also presented. The use of an en-semble for the studied data sets allowed us to slightly increase the classification accuracy compared to the use of individual binary classifiers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arinbj\"orn Kolbeinsson, Benedikt Kolbeinsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative language models are increasingly used for contract drafting and enhancement, creating a scenario where competing parties deploy different language models against each other. This introduces not only a game-theory challenge but also significant concerns related to AI safety and security, as the language model employed by the opposing party can be unknown. These competitive interactions can be seen as adversarial testing grounds, where models are effectively red-teamed to expose vulnerabilities such as generating biased, harmful or legally problematic text. Despite the importance of these challenges, the competitive robustness and safety of these models in adversarial settings remain poorly understood. In this small study, we approach this problem by evaluating the performance and vulnerabilities of major open-source language models in head-to-head competitions, simulating real-world contract negotiations. We further explore how these adversarial interactions can reveal potential risks, informing the development of more secure and reliable models. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on AI safety, offering insights into model selection and optimisation in competitive legal contexts and providing actionable strategies for mitigating risks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Yongyi Yang, Maya Okawa, Kento Nishi, Martin Wattenberg, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hefei Li, Chao Peng, Chenyang Xu, Zhengfeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning is an emerging area of machine learning that focuses on building neural networks capable of solving complex algorithmic tasks. Recent advancements predominantly follow the standard supervised learning paradigm -- feeding an individual problem instance into the network each time and training it to approximate the execution steps of a classical algorithm. We challenge this mode and propose a novel open-book learning framework. In this framework, whether during training or testing, the network can access and utilize all instances in the training dataset when reasoning for a given instance.
  Empirical evaluation is conducted on the challenging CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, which consists of 30 diverse algorithmic tasks. Our open-book learning framework exhibits a significant enhancement in neural reasoning capabilities. Further, we notice that there is recent literature suggesting that multi-task training on CLRS can improve the reasoning accuracy of certain tasks, implying intrinsic connections between different algorithmic tasks. We delve into this direction via the open-book framework. When the network reasons for a specific task, we enable it to aggregate information from training instances of other tasks in an attention-based manner. We show that this open-book attention mechanism offers insights into the inherent relationships among various tasks in the benchmark and provides a robust tool for interpretable multi-task training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungsik Hwang, Ahmadreza Ahmadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to generate and recognize sequential data is fundamental for autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments. Inspired by the key principles of the brain-predictive coding and the Bayesian brain-we propose a novel stochastic Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Biases (RNNPB). The proposed model incorporates stochasticity into the latent space using the reparameterization trick used in variational autoencoders. This approach enables the model to learn probabilistic representations of multidimensional sequences, capturing uncertainty and enhancing robustness against overfitting. We tested the proposed model on a robotic motion dataset to assess its performance in generating and recognizing temporal patterns. The experimental results showed that the stochastic RNNPB model outperformed its deterministic counterpart in generating and recognizing motion sequences. The results highlighted the proposed model's capability to quantify and adjust uncertainty during both learning and inference. The stochasticity resulted in a continuous latent space representation, facilitating stable motion generation and enhanced generalization when recognizing novel sequences. Our approach provides a biologically inspired framework for modeling temporal patterns and advances the development of robust and adaptable systems in artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled agents to master complex video games, from first-person shooters like Counter-Strike to real-time strategy games such as StarCraft II and racing games like Gran Turismo. While these achievements are notable, applying these AI methods in commercial video game production remains challenging due to computational constraints. In commercial scenarios, the majority of computational resources are allocated to 3D rendering, leaving limited capacity for AI methods, which often demand high computational power, particularly those relying on pixel-based sensors. Moreover, the gaming industry prioritizes creating human-like behavior in AI agents to enhance player experience, unlike academic models that focus on maximizing game performance. This paper introduces a novel methodology for training neural networks via imitation learning to play a complex, commercial-standard, VALORANT-like 2v2 tactical shooter game, requiring only modest CPU hardware during inference. Our approach leverages an innovative, pixel-free perception architecture using a small set of ray-cast sensors, which capture essential spatial information efficiently. These sensors allow AI to perform competently without the computational overhead of traditional methods. Models are trained to mimic human behavior using supervised learning on human trajectory data, resulting in realistic and engaging AI agents. Human evaluation tests confirm that our AI agents provide human-like gameplay experiences while operating efficiently under computational constraints. This offers a significant advancement in AI model development for tactical shooter games and possibly other genres.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of large language models has ushered in new paradigms for education. This paper centers on the multi-Agent system in education and proposes the von Neumann multi-Agent system framework. It breaks down each AI Agent into four modules: control unit, logic unit, storage unit, and input-output devices, defining four types of operations: task deconstruction, self-reflection, memory processing, and tool invocation. Furthermore, it introduces related technologies such as Chain-of-Thought, Reson+Act, and Multi-Agent Debate associated with these four types of operations. The paper also discusses the ability enhancement cycle of a multi-Agent system for education, including the outer circulation for human learners to promote knowledge construction and the inner circulation for LLM-based-Agents to enhance swarm intelligence. Through collaboration and reflection, the multi-Agent system can better facilitate human learners' learning and enhance their teaching abilities in this process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a robust security mechanism that enforces mandatory access controls (MAC), but its policy language's complexity creates challenges for policy analysis and management. This research investigates the automation of SELinux policy analysis using graph-based techniques combined with machine learning approaches to detect policy anomalies. The study addresses two key questions: Can SELinux policy analysis be automated through graph analysis, and how do different anomaly detection models compare in analyzing SELinux policies? We will be comparing different machine learning models by evaluating their effectiveness in detecting policy violations and anomalies. Our approach utilizes Neo4j for graph representation of policies, with Node2vec transforming these graph structures into meaningful vector embeddings that can be processed by our machine learning models. In our results, the MLP Neural Network consistently demonstrated superior performance across different dataset sizes, achieving 95% accuracy with balanced precision and recall metrics, while both Random Forest and SVM models showed competitive but slightly lower performance in detecting policy violations. This combination of graph-based modeling and machine learning provides a more sophisticated and automated approach to understanding and analyzing complex SELinux policies compared to traditional manual analysis methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CaseSumm, a novel dataset for long-context summarization in the legal domain that addresses the need for longer and more complex datasets for summarization evaluation. We collect 25.6K U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) opinions and their official summaries, known as "syllabuses." Our dataset is the largest open legal case summarization dataset, and is the first to include summaries of SCOTUS decisions dating back to 1815.
  We also present a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated summaries using both automatic metrics and expert human evaluation, revealing discrepancies between these assessment methods. Our evaluation shows Mistral 7b, a smaller open-source model, outperforms larger models on most automatic metrics and successfully generates syllabus-like summaries. In contrast, human expert annotators indicate that Mistral summaries contain hallucinations. The annotators consistently rank GPT-4 summaries as clearer and exhibiting greater sensitivity and specificity. Further, we find that LLM-based evaluations are not more correlated with human evaluations than traditional automatic metrics. Furthermore, our analysis identifies specific hallucinations in generated summaries, including precedent citation errors and misrepresentations of case facts. These findings demonstrate the limitations of current automatic evaluation methods for legal summarization and highlight the critical role of human evaluation in assessing summary quality, particularly in complex, high-stakes domains.

<p>Abstract: Dataset license compliance is a critical yet complex aspect of developing commercial AI products, particularly with the increasing use of publicly available datasets. Ambiguities in dataset licenses pose significant legal risks, making it challenging even for software IP lawyers to accurately interpret rights and obligations. In this paper, we introduce LicenseGPT, a fine-tuned foundation model (FM) specifically designed for dataset license compliance analysis. We first evaluate existing legal FMs (i.e., FMs specialized in understanding and processing legal texts) and find that the best-performing model achieves a Prediction Agreement (PA) of only 43.75%. LicenseGPT, fine-tuned on a curated dataset of 500 licenses annotated by legal experts, significantly improves PA to 64.30%, outperforming both legal and general-purpose FMs. Through an A/B test and user study with software IP lawyers, we demonstrate that LicenseGPT reduces analysis time by 94.44%, from 108 seconds to 6 seconds per license, without compromising accuracy. Software IP lawyers perceive LicenseGPT as a valuable supplementary tool that enhances efficiency while acknowledging the need for human oversight in complex cases. Our work underscores the potential of specialized AI tools in legal practice and offers a publicly available resource for practitioners and researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihan Ghanim, Mariette Awad</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a crucial role in time series applications, primarily because time series data is employed across real-world scenarios. Detecting anomalies poses significant challenges since anomalies take diverse forms making them hard to pinpoint accurately. Previous research has explored different AD models, making specific assumptions with varying sensitivity toward particular anomaly types. To address this issue, we propose a novel model selection for unsupervised AD using a combination of time series forest (TSF) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that dynamically chooses an AD technique. Our approach allows for effective AD without explicitly depending on ground truth labels that are often scarce and expensive to obtain. Results from the real-time series dataset demonstrate that the proposed model selection approach outperforms all other AD models in terms of the F1 score metric. For the synthetic dataset, our proposed model surpasses all other AD models except for KNN, with an impressive F1 score of 0.989. The proposed model selection framework also exceeded the performance of GPT-4 when prompted to act as an anomaly detector on the synthetic dataset. Exploring different reward functions revealed that the original reward function in our proposed AD model selection approach yielded the best overall scores. We evaluated the performance of the six AD models on an additional three datasets, having global, local, and clustered anomalies respectively, showing that each AD model exhibited distinct performance depending on the type of anomalies. This emphasizes the significance of our proposed AD model selection framework, maintaining high performance across all datasets, and showcasing superior performance across different anomaly types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou You, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating desired images conditioned on given text descriptions has received lots of attention. Recently, diffusion models and autoregressive models have demonstrated their outstanding expressivity and gradually replaced GAN as the favored architectures for text-to-image synthesis. However, they still face some obstacles: slow inference speed and expensive training costs. To achieve more powerful and faster text-to-image synthesis under complex scenes, we propose TIGER, a text-to-image GAN with pretrained representations. To be specific, we propose a vision-empowered discriminator and a high-capacity generator. (i) The vision-empowered discriminator absorbs the complex scene understanding ability and the domain generalization ability from pretrained vision models to enhance model performance. Unlike previous works, we explore stacking multiple pretrained models in our discriminator to collect multiple different representations. (ii) The high-capacity generator aims to achieve effective text-image fusion while increasing the model capacity. The high-capacity generator consists of multiple novel high-capacity fusion blocks (HFBlock). And the HFBlock contains several deep fusion modules and a global fusion module, which play different roles to benefit our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed TIGER both on standard and zero-shot text-to-image synthesis tasks. On the standard text-to-image synthesis task, TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, which obtain a new FID 5.48 (COCO) and 9.38 (CUB). On the zero-shot text-to-image synthesis task, we achieve comparable performance with fewer model parameters, smaller training data size and faster inference speed. Additionally, more experiments and analyses are conducted in the Supplementary Material.</p>

<p>Abstract: Introduction: Healthcare AI models often inherit biases from their training data. While efforts have primarily targeted bias in structured data, mental health heavily depends on unstructured data. This study aims to detect and mitigate linguistic differences related to non-biological differences in the training data of AI models designed to assist in pediatric mental health screening. Our objectives are: (1) to assess the presence of bias by evaluating outcome parity across sex subgroups, (2) to identify bias sources through textual distribution analysis, and (3) to develop a de-biasing method for mental health text data. Methods: We examined classification parity across demographic groups and assessed how gendered language influences model predictions. A data-centric de-biasing method was applied, focusing on neutralizing biased terms while retaining salient clinical information. This methodology was tested on a model for automatic anxiety detection in pediatric patients. Results: Our findings revealed a systematic under-diagnosis of female adolescent patients, with a 4% lower accuracy and a 9% higher False Negative Rate (FNR) compared to male patients, likely due to disparities in information density and linguistic differences in patient notes. Notes for male patients were on average 500 words longer, and linguistic similarity metrics indicated distinct word distributions between genders. Implementing our de-biasing approach reduced diagnostic bias by up to 27%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing equity across demographic groups. Discussion: We developed a data-centric de-biasing framework to address gender-based content disparities within clinical text. By neutralizing biased language and enhancing focus on clinically essential information, our approach demonstrates an effective strategy for mitigating bias in AI healthcare models trained on text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Pingzhi Li, Min Chen, Jinglei Cheng, Junyu Liu, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting non-Von Neumann paradigm, offering provable speedups over classical computing for specific problems. However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.</p>

Most existing systems use language models to describe videos in natural language sentences, but this has several major shortcomings. Such systems can rely too heavily on the language model component and base their output on statistical regularities in natural language text rather than on the visual contents of the video. Additionally, natural language annotations cannot be readily processed by a computer, are difficult to evaluate with performance metrics and cannot be easily translated into a different natural language. In this paper, we propose a method to annotate videos with knowledge graphs, and so avoid these problems. Specifically, we propose a deep-learning-based model for this task that first predicts pairs of individuals and then the relations between them. Additionally, we propose an extension of our model for the inclusion of background knowledge in the construction of knowledge graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uro\v{s} Mlakar, Iztok Fister Jr., Iztok Fister</p>
<p>Abstract: The Numerical Association Rule Mining paradigm that includes concurrent dealing with numerical and categorical attributes is beneficial for discovering associations from datasets consisting of both features. The process is not considered as easy since it incorporates several processing steps running sequentially that form an entire pipeline, e.g., preprocessing, algorithm selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and the definition of metrics evaluating the quality of the association rule. In this paper, we proposed a novel Automated Machine Learning method, NiaAutoARM, for constructing the full association rule mining pipelines based on stochastic population-based meta-heuristics automatically. Along with the theoretical representation of the proposed method, we also present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Song, Mahmud Akhter, Dana Atzil Slonim, Maria Liakata</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarization, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, particularly social media threads . We introduce \textit{NarrativeReason}, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarization through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on mental health-related timeline summarization tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akul Goyal, Carl Edwards</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing work within transfer learning often follows a two-step process -- pre-training over a large-scale source domain and then finetuning over limited samples from the target domain. Yet, despite its popularity, this methodology has been shown to suffer in the presence of distributional shift -- specifically when the output spaces diverge. Previous work has focused on increasing model performance within this setting by identifying and classifying only the shared output classes between distributions. However, these methods are inherently limited as they ignore classes outside the shared class set, disregarding potential information relevant to the model transfer. This paper proposes a new process for few-shot transfer learning that selects and weighs classes from the source domain to optimize the transfer between domains. More concretely, we use Wasserstein distance to choose a set of source classes and their weights that minimize the distance between the source and target domain. To justify our proposed algorithm, we provide a generalization analysis of the performance of the learned classifier over the target domain and show that our method corresponds to a bound minimization algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach (WaSS) by experimenting on several different datasets and presenting superior performance within various label shift settings, including the extreme case where the label spaces are disjoint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick Papoulias</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning experiments have critical requirements regarding the careful handling of their datasets as well as the efficient and correct usage of APIs that interact with hardware accelerators. On the one hand, software mistakes during data handling can contaminate experiments and lead to incorrect results. On the other hand, poorly coded APIs that interact with the hardware can lead to sub-optimal usage and untrustworthy conclusions. In this work we investigate the use of Linear Logic for the analysis of Deep Learning experiments. We show that primitives and operators of Linear Logic can be used to express: (i) an abstract representation of the control flow of an experiment, (ii) a set of available experimental resources, such as API calls to the underlying data-structures and hardware as well as (iii) reasoning rules about the correct consumption of resources during experiments. Our proposed model is not only lightweight but also easy to comprehend having both a symbolic and a visual component. Finally, its artifacts are themselves proofs in Linear Logic that can be readily verified by off-the-shelf reasoners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongrui Shi, Valentin Radu, Po Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid expansion of edge devices, such as IoT devices, where crucial data needed for machine learning applications is generated, it becomes essential to promote their participation in privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) systems. The best way to achieve this desiderate is by reducing their training workload to match their constrained computational resources. While prior FL research has address the workload constrains by introducing lightweight models on the edge, limited attention has been given to optimizing on-device training efficiency through reducing the amount of data need during training. In this work, we propose FedFT-EDS, a novel approach that combines Fine-Tuning of partial client models with Entropy-based Data Selection to reduce training workloads on edge devices. By actively selecting the most informative local instances for learning, FedFT-EDS reduces training data significantly in FL and demonstrates that not all user data is equally beneficial for FL on all rounds. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that FedFT-EDS uses only 50% user data while improving the global model performance compared to baseline methods, FedAvg and FedProx. Importantly, FedFT-EDS improves client learning efficiency by up to 3 times, using one third of training time on clients to achieve an equivalent performance to the baselines. This work highlights the importance of data selection in FL and presents a promising pathway to scalable and efficient Federate Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Siino, Ilenia Tinnirello, Marco La Cascia</p>
<p>Abstract: Text Classification (TC) stands as a cornerstone within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly when viewed through the lens of computer science and engineering. The past decade has seen deep learning revolutionize TC, propelling advancements in text retrieval, categorization, information extraction, and summarization. The scholarly literature is rich with datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, with English being the predominant language of focus, despite studies involving Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, and others. The efficacy of TC models relies heavily on their ability to capture intricate textual relationships and nonlinear correlations, necessitating a comprehensive examination of the entire TC pipeline.
  This monograph provides an in-depth exploration of the TC pipeline, with a particular emphasis on evaluating the impact of each component on the overall performance of TC models. The pipeline includes state-of-the-art datasets, text preprocessing techniques, text representation methods, classification models, evaluation metrics, current results and future trends. Each chapter meticulously examines these stages, presenting technical innovations and significant recent findings. The work critically assesses various classification strategies, offering comparative analyses, examples, case studies, and experimental evaluations. These contributions extend beyond a typical survey, providing a detailed and insightful exploration of TC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changchang Yin, Shihan Fu, Bingsheng Yao, Thai-Hoang Pham, Weidan Cao, Dakuo Wang, Jeffrey Caterino, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis is an organ dysfunction caused by a deregulated immune response to an infection. Early sepsis prediction and identification allow for timely intervention, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Clinical calculators (e.g., the six-organ dysfunction assessment of SOFA) play a vital role in sepsis identification within clinicians' workflow, providing evidence-based risk assessments essential for sepsis diagnosis. However, artificial intelligence (AI) sepsis prediction models typically generate a single sepsis risk score without incorporating clinical calculators for assessing organ dysfunctions, making the models less convincing and transparent to clinicians. To bridge the gap, we propose to mimic clinicians' workflow with a novel framework SepsisCalc to integrate clinical calculators into the predictive model, yielding a clinically transparent and precise model for utilization in clinical settings. Practically, clinical calculators usually combine information from multiple component variables in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and might not be applicable when the variables are (partially) missing. We mitigate this issue by representing EHRs as temporal graphs and integrating a learning module to dynamically add the accurately estimated calculator to the graphs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on sepsis prediction tasks. Moreover, we developed a system to identify organ dysfunctions and potential sepsis risks, providing a human-AI interaction tool for deployment, which can help clinicians understand the prediction outputs and prepare timely interventions for the corresponding dysfunctions, paving the way for actionable clinical decision-making support for early intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaoyi Fang, Weiyu Du, Hang Wang, Junshan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: World models have recently emerged as a promising approach to reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of visual control tasks. This work aims to obtain a deep understanding of the robustness and generalization capabilities of world models. Thus motivated, we develop a stochastic differential equation formulation by treating the world model learning as a stochastic dynamical system, and characterize the impact of latent representation errors on robustness and generalization, for both cases with zero-drift representation errors and with non-zero-drift representation errors. Our somewhat surprising findings, based on both theoretic and experimental studies, reveal that for the case with zero drift, modest latent representation errors can in fact function as implicit regularization and hence result in improved robustness. We further propose a Jacobian regularization scheme to mitigate the compounding error propagation effects of non-zero drift, thereby enhancing training stability and robustness. Our experimental studies corroborate that this regularization approach not only stabilizes training but also accelerates convergence and improves accuracy of long-horizon prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuliano Lorenzoni, Pedro Elkind Velmovitsky, Paulo Alencar, Donald Cowan</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression has impacted millions of people worldwide and has become one of the most prevalent mental disorders. Early mental disorder detection can lead to cost savings for public health agencies and avoid the onset of other major comorbidities. Additionally, the shortage of specialized personnel is a critical issue because clinical depression diagnosis is highly dependent on expert professionals and is time consuming.
  In this study, we explore the use of GPT-4 for clinical depression assessment based on transcript analysis. We examine the model's ability to classify patient interviews into binary categories: depressed and not depressed. A comparative analysis is conducted considering prompt complexity (e.g., using both simple and complex prompts) as well as varied temperature settings to assess the impact of prompt complexity and randomness on the model's performance.
  Results indicate that GPT-4 exhibits considerable variability in accuracy and F1-Score across configurations, with optimal performance observed at lower temperature values (0.0-0.2) for complex prompts. However, beyond a certain threshold (temperature >= 0.3), the relationship between randomness and performance becomes unpredictable, diminishing the gains from prompt complexity.
  These findings suggest that, while GPT-4 shows promise for clinical assessment, the configuration of the prompts and model parameters requires careful calibration to ensure consistent results. This preliminary study contributes to understanding the dynamics between prompt engineering and large language models, offering insights for future development of AI-powered tools in clinical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several Large Language Models (LLMs) on MedRedQA, a dataset of consumer-based medical questions and answers by verified experts extracted from the AskDocs subreddit. While LLMs have shown proficiency in clinical question answering (QA) benchmarks, their effectiveness on real-world, consumer-based, medical questions remains less understood. MedRedQA presents unique challenges, such as informal language and the need for precise responses suited to non-specialist queries. To assess model performance, responses were generated using five LLMs: GPT-4o mini, Llama 3.1: 70B, Mistral-123B, Mistral-7B, and Gemini-Flash. A cross-evaluation method was used, where each model evaluated its responses as well as those of others to minimize bias. The results indicated that GPT-4o mini achieved the highest alignment with expert responses according to four out of the five models' judges, while Mistral-7B scored lowest according to three out of five models' judges. This study highlights the potential and limitations of current LLMs for consumer health medical question answering, indicating avenues for further development.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of AI, NVIDIA GPUs have become the de facto standard for AI system design. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Intel Gaudi NPUs as an alternative to NVIDIA GPUs for AI model serving. First, we create a suite of microbenchmarks to compare Intel Gaudi-2 with NVIDIA A100, showing that Gaudi-2 achieves competitive performance not only in primitive AI compute, memory, and communication operations but also in executing several important AI workloads end-to-end. We then assess Gaudi NPU's programmability by discussing several software-level optimization strategies to employ for implementing critical FBGEMM operators and vLLM, evaluating their efficiency against GPU-optimized counterparts. Results indicate that Gaudi-2 achieves energy efficiency comparable to A100, though there are notable areas for improvement in terms of software maturity. Overall, we conclude that, with effective integration into high-level AI frameworks, Gaudi NPUs could challenge NVIDIA GPU's dominance in the AI server market, though further improvements are necessary to fully compete with NVIDIA's robust software ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Having a high quality software is essential in software engineering, which requires robust validation and verification processes during testing activities. Manual testing, while effective, can be time consuming and costly, leading to an increased demand for automated methods. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly influenced software engineering, particularly in areas like requirements analysis, test automation, and debugging. This paper explores an agent-oriented approach to automated software testing, using LLMs to reduce human intervention and enhance testing efficiency. The proposed framework integrates LLMs to generate unit tests, visualize call graphs, and automate test execution and reporting. Evaluations across multiple applications in Python and Java demonstrate the system's high test coverage and efficient operation. This research underscores the potential of LLM-powered agents to streamline software testing workflows while addressing challenges in scalability and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hikari Tomita, Nobuhiro Nakamura, Shoichi Ishida, Toshio Kamiya, Kei Terayama</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, many studies have increasingly explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate research ideas and scientific hypotheses. However, real-world research and development often require solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges where solutions may not be readily found through existing knowledge related to the problem. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage the vast, comprehensive knowledge of LLMs to generate effective, breakthrough solutions by integrating various perspectives from other disciplines. Here, we propose SELLM (Solution Enumeration via comprehensive List and LLM), a framework leveraging LLMs and structured guidance using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles, such as International Patent Classification (IPC) and the periodic table of elements. SELLM systematically constructs comprehensive expert agents from the list to generate cross-disciplinary and effective solutions. To evaluate SELLM's practicality, we applied it to two challenges: improving light extraction in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting and developing electrodes for next-generation memory materials. The results demonstrate that SELLM significantly facilitates the generation of effective solutions compared to cases without specific customization or effort, showcasing the potential of SELLM to enable LLMs to generate effective solutions even for challenging problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces FDSC, a private-protected subspace clustering (SC) approach with federated learning (FC) schema. In each client, there is a deep subspace clustering network accounting for grouping the isolated data, composed of a encode network, a self-expressive layer, and a decode network. FDSC is achieved by uploading the encode network to communicate with other clients in the server. Besides, FDSC is also enhanced by preserving the local neighborhood relationship in each client. With the effects of federated learning and locality preservation, the learned data features from the encoder are boosted so as to enhance the self-expressiveness learning and result in better clustering performance. Experiments test FDSC on public datasets and compare with other clustering methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of FDSC.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study evaluates fine-tuning strategies for text classification using the DistilBERT model, specifically the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english variant. Through structured experiments, we examine the influence of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs on accuracy, F1-score, and loss. Polynomial regression analyses capture foundational and incremental impacts of these hyperparameters, focusing on fine-tuning adjustments relative to a baseline model.
  Results reveal variability in metrics due to hyperparameter configurations, showing trade-offs among performance metrics. For example, a higher learning rate reduces loss in relative analysis (p=0.027) but challenges accuracy improvements. Meanwhile, batch size significantly impacts accuracy and F1-score in absolute regression (p=0.028 and p=0.005) but has limited influence on loss optimization (p=0.170). The interaction between epochs and batch size maximizes F1-score (p=0.001), underscoring the importance of hyperparameter interplay.
  These findings highlight the need for fine-tuning strategies addressing non-linear hyperparameter interactions to balance performance across metrics. Such variability and metric trade-offs are relevant for tasks beyond text classification, including NLP and computer vision. This analysis informs fine-tuning strategies for large language models and promotes adaptive designs for broader model applicability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) continue to experience rapid developments and integration into modern-day applications. Overall, WSNs collect and process relevant data through sensors or nodes and communicate with different networks for superior information management. Nevertheless, a primary concern relative to WSNs is security. Considering the high constraints on throughput, battery, processing power, and memory, typical security procedures present limitations for application in WSNs. This research focuses on the integration of WSNs with the cloud platform, specifically to address these security risks. The cloud platform also adopts a security-driven approach and has attracted many applications across various sectors globally. This research specifically explores how cloud computing could be exploited to impede Denial of Service attacks from endangering WSNs. WSNs are now deployed in various low-powered applications, including disaster management, homeland security, battlefield surveillance, agriculture, and the healthcare industry. WSNs are distinguished from traditional networks by the numerous wireless connected sensors being deployed to conduct an assigned task. In testing scenarios, the size of WSNs ranges from a few to several thousand. The overarching requirements of WSNs include rapid processing of collected data, low-cost installation and maintenance, and low latency in network operations. Given that a substantial amount of WSN applications are used in high-risk and volatile environments, they must effectively address security concerns. This includes the secure movement, storage, and communication of data through networks, an environment in which WSNs are notably vulnerable. The limitations of WSNs have meant that they are predominantly used in unsecured applications despite positive advancements. This study explores methods for integrating the WSN with the cloud.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern AI algorithms require labeled data. In real world, majority of data are unlabeled. Labeling the data are costly. this is particularly true for some areas requiring special skills, such as reading radiology images by physicians. To most efficiently use expert's time for the data labeling, one promising approach is human-in-the-loop active learning algorithm. In this work, we propose a novel active learning framework with significant potential for application in modern AI systems. Unlike the traditional active learning methods, which only focus on determining which data point should be labeled, our framework also introduces an innovative perspective on incorporating different query scheme. We propose a model to integrate the information from different types of queries. Based on this model, our active learning frame can automatically determine how the next question is queried. We further developed a data driven exploration and exploitation framework into our active learning method. This method can be embedded in numerous active learning algorithms. Through simulations on five real-world datasets, including a highly complex real image task, our proposed active learning framework exhibits higher accuracy and lower loss compared to other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have gained tremendous success in text-to-image generation, yet still lag behind with visual understanding tasks, an area dominated by autoregressive vision-language models. We propose a large-scale and fully end-to-end diffusion model for multi-modal understanding and generation that significantly improves on existing diffusion-based multimodal models, and is the first of its kind to support the full suite of vision-language modeling capabilities. Inspired by the multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT) and recent advances in discrete diffusion language modeling, we leverage a cross-modal maximum likelihood estimation framework that simultaneously trains the conditional likelihoods of both images and text jointly under a single loss function, which is back-propagated through both branches of the diffusion transformer. The resulting model is highly flexible and capable of a wide range of tasks including image generation, captioning, and visual question answering. Our model attained competitive performance compared to recent unified image understanding and generation models, demonstrating the potential of multimodal diffusion modeling as a promising alternative to autoregressive next-token prediction models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashay Athalye, Nishanth Kumar, Tom Silver, Yichao Liang, Tom\'as Lozano-P\'erez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling</p>
<p>Abstract: Our aim is to learn to solve long-horizon decision-making problems in highly-variable, combinatorially-complex robotics domains given raw sensor input in the form of images. Previous work has shown that one way to achieve this aim is to learn a structured abstract transition model in the form of symbolic predicates and operators, and then plan within this model to solve novel tasks at test time. However, these learned models do not ground directly into pixels from just a handful of demonstrations. In this work, we propose to invent predicates that operate directly over input images by leveraging the capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Our key idea is that, given a set of demonstrations, a VLM can be used to propose a set of predicates that are potentially relevant for decision-making and then to determine the truth values of these predicates in both the given demonstrations and new image inputs. We build upon an existing framework for predicate invention, which generates feature-based predicates operating on object-centric states, to also generate visual predicates that operate on images. Experimentally, we show that our approach -- pix2pred -- is able to invent semantically meaningful predicates that enable generalization to novel, complex, and long-horizon tasks across two simulated robotic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanting Wang, Patrick Lenihan, Zheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised machine learning techniques have shown promising results in code analysis and optimization problems. However, a learning-based solution can be brittle because minor changes in hardware or application workloads -- such as facing a new CPU architecture or code pattern -- may jeopardize decision accuracy, ultimately undermining model robustness. We introduce Prom, an open-source library to enhance the robustness and performance of predictive models against such changes during deployment. Prom achieves this by using statistical assessments to identify test samples prone to mispredictions and using feedback on these samples to improve a deployed model. We showcase Prom by applying it to 13 representative machine learning models across 5 code analysis and optimization tasks. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that Prom can successfully identify an average of 96% (up to 100%) of mispredictions. By relabeling up to 5% of the Prom-identified samples through incremental learning, Prom can help a deployed model achieve a performance comparable to that attained during its model training phase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Li, Can Chen, Jiajun Li, Jiahui Duan, Xiongwei Han, Tao Zhong, Vincent Chau, Weiwei Wu, Wanyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: By exploiting the correlation between the structure and the solution of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Machine Learning (ML) has become a promising method for solving large-scale MILP problems. Existing ML-based MILP solvers mainly focus on end-to-end solution learning, which suffers from the scalability issue due to the high dimensionality of the solution space. Instead of directly learning the optimal solution, this paper aims to learn a reduced and equivalent model of the original MILP as an intermediate step. The reduced model often corresponds to interpretable operations and is much simpler, enabling us to solve large-scale MILP problems much faster than existing commercial solvers. However, current approaches rely only on the optimal reduced model, overlooking the significant preference information of all reduced models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a preference-based model reduction learning method, which considers the relative performance (i.e., objective cost and constraint feasibility) of all reduced models on each MILP instance as preferences. We also introduce an attention mechanism to capture and represent preference information, which helps improve the performance of model reduction learning tasks. Moreover, we propose a SetCover based pruning method to control the number of reduced models (i.e., labels), thereby simplifying the learning process. Evaluation on real-world MILP problems shows that 1) compared to the state-of-the-art model reduction ML methods, our method obtains nearly 20% improvement on solution accuracy, and 2) compared to the commercial solver Gurobi, two to four orders of magnitude speedups are achieved.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuxiong Sun, Peng He, Qirui Ji, Zehua Zang, Jiangmeng Li, Rui Wang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication is essential in coordinating the behaviors of multiple agents. However, existing methods primarily emphasize content, timing, and partners for information sharing, often neglecting the critical aspect of integrating shared information. This gap can significantly impact agents' ability to understand and respond to complex, uncertain interactions, thus affecting overall communication efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce M2I2, a novel framework designed to enhance the agents' capabilities to assimilate and utilize received information effectively. M2I2 equips agents with advanced capabilities for masked state modeling and joint-action prediction, enriching their perception of environmental uncertainties and facilitating the anticipation of teammates' intentions. This approach ensures that agents are furnished with both comprehensive and relevant information, bolstering more informed and synergistic behaviors. Moreover, we propose a Dimensional Rational Network, innovatively trained via a meta-learning paradigm, to identify the importance of dimensional pieces of information, evaluating their contributions to decision-making and auxiliary tasks. Then, we implement an importance-based heuristic for selective information masking and sharing. This strategy optimizes the efficiency of masked state modeling and the rationale behind information sharing. We evaluate M2I2 across diverse multi-agent tasks, the results demonstrate its superior performance, efficiency, and generalization capabilities, over existing state-of-the-art methods in various complex scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scoring the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has witnessed growing interest recently. Existing benchmarks have highlighted the impressive performance of LMMs in text recognition; however, their abilities on certain challenging tasks, such as text localization, handwritten content extraction, and logical reasoning, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce OCRBench v2, a large-scale bilingual text-centric benchmark with currently the most comprehensive set of tasks (4x more tasks than the previous multi-scene benchmark OCRBench), the widest coverage of scenarios (31 diverse scenarios including street scene, receipt, formula, diagram, and so on), and thorough evaluation metrics, with a total of 10,000 human-verified question-answering pairs and a high proportion of difficult samples. After carefully benchmarking state-of-the-art LMMs on OCRBench v2, we find that 20 out of 22 LMMs score below 50 (100 in total) and suffer from five-type limitations, including less frequently encountered text recognition, fine-grained perception, layout perception, complex element parsing, and logical reasoning.

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought significant improvements to a wide range of tasks in real-world applications. However, LLMs still exhibit certain limitations in extracting implicit semantic information. In this paper, we apply MLLMs to the Multi-modal Entity Set Expansion (MESE) task, which aims to expand a handful of seed entities with new entities belonging to the same semantic class, and multi-modal information is provided with each entity. We explore the capabilities of MLLMs to understand implicit semantic information at the entity-level granularity through the MESE task, introducing a listwise ranking method LUSAR that maps local scores to global rankings. Our LUSAR demonstrates significant improvements in MLLM's performance on the MESE task, marking the first use of generative MLLM for ESE tasks and extending the applicability of listwise ranking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) aims to detect and correct errors in the input Chinese sentences. Recently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMS) have been employed to improve the performance. However, current approaches ignore that correction difficulty varies across different instances and treat these samples equally, enhancing the challenge of model learning. To address this problem, we propose a multi-granularity Curriculum Learning (CL) framework. Specifically, we first calculate the correction difficulty of these samples and feed them into the model from easy to hard batch by batch. Then Instance-Level CL is employed to help the model optimize in the appropriate direction automatically by regulating the loss function. Extensive experimental results and comprehensive analyses of various datasets prove the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Chunk-Distilled Language Modeling (CD-LM), an approach to text generation that addresses two challenges in current large language models (LLMs): the inefficiency of token-level generation, and the difficulty of adapting to new data and knowledge. Our method combines deep network-based LLMs with a straightforward retrieval module, which allows the generation of multi-token text chunks at a single decoding step. Our retrieval framework enables flexible construction of model- or domain-specific datastores, either leveraging the internal knowledge of existing models, or incorporating expert insights from human-annotated corpora. This adaptability allows for enhanced control over the language model's distribution without necessitating additional training. We present the CD-LM formulation along with performance metrics demonstrating its ability to improve language model performance and efficiency across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolei Wang, Xiaoyang Wang, Huihui Bai, Eng Gee Lim, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing unsupervised distillation-based methods rely on the differences between encoded and decoded features to locate abnormal regions in test images. However, the decoder trained only on normal samples still reconstructs abnormal patch features well, degrading performance. This issue is particularly pronounced in unsupervised multi-class anomaly detection tasks. We attribute this behavior to over-generalization(OG) of decoder: the significantly increasing diversity of patch patterns in multi-class training enhances the model generalization on normal patches, but also inadvertently broadens its generalization to abnormal patches. To mitigate OG, we propose a novel approach that leverages class-agnostic learnable prompts to capture common textual normality across various visual patterns, and then apply them to guide the decoded features towards a normal textual representation, suppressing over-generalization of the decoder on abnormal patterns. To further improve performance, we also introduce a gated mixture-of-experts module to specialize in handling diverse patch patterns and reduce mutual interference between them in multi-class training. Our method achieves competitive performance on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang, Huamin Wang, Hangchi Shen, Shukai Duan, Shiping Wen, Tingwen Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, it can be noticed that most models based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) only use a same level temporal resolution to deal with speech classification problems, which makes these models cannot learn the information of input data at different temporal scales. Additionally, owing to the different time lengths of the data before and after the sub-modules of many models, the effective residual connections cannot be applied to optimize the training processes of these models.To solve these problems, on the one hand, we reconstruct the temporal dimension of the audio spectrum to propose a novel method named as Temporal Reconstruction (TR) by referring the hierarchical processing process of the human brain for understanding speech. Then, the reconstructed SNN model with TR can learn the information of input data at different temporal scales and model more comprehensive semantic information from audio data because it enables the networks to learn the information of input data at different temporal resolutions. On the other hand, we propose the Non-Aligned Residual (NAR) method by analyzing the audio data, which allows the residual connection can be used in two audio data with different time lengths. We have conducted plentiful experiments on the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and the Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) datasets. According to the experiment results, we have achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) result 81.02\% on SSC for the test classification accuracy of all SNN models, and we have obtained the SOTA result 96.04\% on SHD for the classification accuracy of all models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. However, current RAG methods face two limitations: (1) they only cover limited RAG scenarios. (2) They suffer from limited task diversity due to the lack of a general RAG dataset. To address these limitations, we propose RAG-Instruct, a general method for synthesizing diverse and high-quality RAG instruction data based on any source corpus. Our approach leverages (1) five RAG paradigms, which encompass diverse query-document relationships, and (2) instruction simulation, which enhances instruction diversity and quality by utilizing the strengths of existing instruction datasets. Using this method, we construct a 40K instruction dataset from Wikipedia, comprehensively covering diverse RAG scenarios and tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RAG-Instruct effectively enhances LLMs' RAG capabilities, achieving strong zero-shot performance and significantly outperforming various RAG baselines across a diverse set of tasks.

This survey provides the first comprehensive review of LoRA techniques beyond large Language Models to general foundation models, including recent techniques foundations, emerging frontiers and applications of low-rank adaptation across multiple domains. Finally, this survey discusses key challenges and future research directions in theoretical understanding, scalability, and robustness.

<p>Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper advances empirical demand analysis by integrating multimodal product representations derived from artificial intelligence (AI). Using a detailed dataset of toy cars on \textit{Amazon.com}, we combine text descriptions, images, and tabular covariates to represent each product using transformer-based embedding models. These embeddings capture nuanced attributes, such as quality, branding, and visual characteristics, that traditional methods often struggle to summarize. Moreover, we fine-tune these embeddings for causal inference tasks. We show that the resulting embeddings substantially improve the predictive accuracy of sales ranks and prices and that they lead to more credible causal estimates of price elasticity. Notably, we uncover strong heterogeneity in price elasticity driven by these product-specific features. Our findings illustrate that AI-driven representations can enrich and modernize empirical demand analysis. The insights generated may also prove valuable for applied causal inference more broadly.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the long-standing aspirations in conversational AI is to allow them to autonomously take initiatives in conversations, i.e., being proactive. This is especially challenging for multi-party conversations. Prior NLP research focused mainly on predicting the next speaker from contexts like preceding conversations. In this paper, we demonstrate the limitations of such methods and rethink what it means for AI to be proactive in multi-party, human-AI conversations. We propose that just like humans, rather than merely reacting to turn-taking cues, a proactive AI formulates its own inner thoughts during a conversation, and seeks the right moment to contribute. Through a formative study with 24 participants and inspiration from linguistics and cognitive psychology, we introduce the Inner Thoughts framework. Our framework equips AI with a continuous, covert train of thoughts in parallel to the overt communication process, which enables it to proactively engage by modeling its intrinsic motivation to express these thoughts. We instantiated this framework into two real-time systems: an AI playground web app and a chatbot. Through a technical evaluation and user studies with human participants, our framework significantly surpasses existing baselines on aspects like anthropomorphism, coherence, intelligence, and turn-taking appropriateness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenkai Tu, Guojia Wan, Zhengchun Shang, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a structured representation of knowledge but often suffer from challenges of incompleteness. To address this, link prediction or knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing new facts based on existing facts in KGs. Previous knowledge graph embedding models are limited in their ability to capture expressive features, especially when compared to deeper, multi-layer models. These approaches also assign a single static embedding to each entity and relation, disregarding the fact that entities and relations can exhibit different behaviors in varying graph contexts. Due to complex context over a fact triple of a KG, existing methods have to leverage complex non-linear context encoder, like transformer, to project entity and relation into low dimensional representations, resulting in high computation cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose Triple Receptance Perception (TRP) architecture to model sequential information, enabling the learning of dynamic context of entities and relations. Then we use tensor decomposition to calculate triple scores, providing robust relational decoding capabilities. This integration allows for more expressive representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as YAGO3-10, UMLS, FB15k, and FB13 in link prediction and triple classification tasks demonstrate that our method performs better than several state-of-the-art models, proving the effectiveness of the integration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio-language models (ALMs) excel in zero-shot audio classification, a task where models classify previously unseen audio clips at test time by leveraging descriptive natural language prompts. We introduce TSPE (Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble), a simple, training-free hard prompting method that boosts ALEs' zero-shot performance by customizing prompts for diverse audio classification tasks. Rather than using generic template-based prompts like "Sound of a car" we generate context-rich prompts, such as "Sound of a car coming from a tunnel". Specifically, we leverage label information to identify suitable sound attributes, such as "loud" and "feeble", and appropriate sound sources, such as "tunnel" and "street" and incorporate this information into the prompts used by Audio-Language Models (ALMs) for audio classification. Further, to enhance audio-text alignment, we perform prompt ensemble across TSPE-generated task-specific prompts. When evaluated on 12 diverse audio classification datasets, TSPE improves performance across ALMs by showing an absolute improvement of 1.23-16.36% over vanilla zero-shot evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Pawelczyk, Lillian Sun, Zhenting Qi, Aounon Kumar, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative AI, especially large language models, has led to their integration into a variety of applications. A key phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization - where a strong model trained on a weak model's outputs surpasses the weak model in task performance - has gained significant attention. Yet, whether critical trustworthiness properties such as robustness, fairness, and privacy can generalize similarly remains an open question. In this work, we study this question by examining if a stronger model can inherit trustworthiness properties when fine-tuned on a weaker model's outputs, a process we term weak-to-strong trustworthiness generalization. To address this, we introduce two foundational training strategies: 1) Weak Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak TFT), which leverages trustworthiness regularization during the fine-tuning of the weak model, and 2) Weak and Weak-to-Strong Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak+WTS TFT), which extends regularization to both weak and strong models. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets reveals that while some trustworthiness properties, such as fairness, adversarial, and OOD robustness, show significant improvement in transfer when both models were regularized, others like privacy do not exhibit signs of weak-to-strong trustworthiness. As the first study to explore trustworthiness generalization via weak-to-strong generalization, our work provides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of weak-to-strong generalization.</p>

Thirty participants have participated in this experiment. Based on the statistical results, we found that there are correlations between students personality traits and their physiological signal change when learning via videos. Specifically, we found that participants degree of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experiences are correlated with the variance of heart rates, the variance of GSR values, and the skewness of voice frequencies, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhan Huang, Tejaswini Pedapati, Pin-Yu Chen, Jianxi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt learning is an effective way to exploit the potential of large-scale pre-trained foundational models. Continuous prompts parameterize context tokens in prompts by turning them into differentiable vectors. Deep continuous prompts insert prompts not only in the input but also in the intermediate hidden representations. Manually designed deep continuous prompts exhibit a remarkable improvement compared to the zero-shot pre-trained model on downstream tasks. How to automate the continuous prompt design is an underexplored area, and a fundamental question arises, is manually designed deep prompt strategy optimal? To answer this question, we propose a method dubbed differentiable prompt learning (DPL). The DPL method is formulated as an optimization problem to automatically determine the optimal context length of the prompt to be added to each layer, where the objective is to maximize the performance. We test the DPL method on the pre-trained CLIP. We empirically find that by using only limited data, our DPL method can find deep continuous prompt configuration with high confidence. The performance on the downstream tasks exhibits the superiority of the automatic design: our method boosts the average test accuracy by 2.60% on 11 datasets compared to baseline methods. Besides, our method focuses only on the prompt configuration (i.e. context length for each layer), which means that our method is compatible with the baseline methods that have sophisticated designs to boost the performance. The DPL method can be deployed to large language models or computer vision models at no cost.</p>

Conversely, machine learning (ML) models for crop modeling are powerful and scalable yet operate as black boxes and lack adherence to crop growths physical principles. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of both approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water scarcity at the pixel level. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function. Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, climate data, simulated water use data, and pixel-level yield data, our model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an R2 of up to 0.77, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art models like RNNs and Transformers. Additionally, it provides interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedram Fekri, Mehrdad Zadeh, Javad Dargahi</p>
<p>Abstract: The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the sensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been proposed</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, large models are prone to generating harmful content when faced with complex attack instructions, significantly reducing their defensive capabilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method based on constructing data aligned with multi-dimensional attack defense to enhance the generative security of large models. The core of our method lies in improving the effectiveness of safe alignment learning for large models by innova-tively increasing the diversity of attack instruction dimensions and the accuracy of generat-ing safe responses. To validate the effectiveness of our method, beyond existing security evaluation benchmarks, we additionally designed new security evaluation benchmarks and conducted comparative experiments using Llama3.2 as the baseline model. The final ex-perimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the generative security of large models under complex instructional attacks, while also maintaining and enhancing the models' general capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Yang, Volodymyr Kindratenko, ChengXiang Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Training language models (LMs) and their application agents is increasingly costly due to large datasets and models, making test failures difficult to bear. Simplified language environments serve as primordial training and testing grounds, retaining essential commonsense and communication skills but in a more digestible form, potentially enhancing the learning efficiency of LMs, and thus reducing the required model size and data volume for effective training and evaluation. In these simplified language environments, workable strategies for small models, datasets, and agents may be adaptable to larger models, datasets, and agents in complex language environments.
  To create such environments, we focus on two aspects: i) minimizing language dataset noise and complexity, and ii) preserving the essential text distribution characteristics. Unlike previous methods, we propose a pipeline to refine text data by eliminating noise, minimizing vocabulary, and maintaining genre-specific patterns (e.g., for books, conversation, code, etc.). Implementing this pipeline with large LMs, we have created a leaner suite of LM training and evaluation datasets: 71M Leaner-Pretrain, 7M Leaner-Instruct, Leaner-Glue for assessing linguistic proficiency, and Leaner-Eval for testing instruction-following ability.
  Our experiments show that leaner pre-training boosts LM learning efficiency. Tiny LMs trained on these datasets outperform those trained on original datasets in instruction-following across different language granularity levels. Moreover, the Leaner-Pretrain dataset's alignment with conventional large LM training sets enables resource-optimized analysis of how learning objectives, model architectures, and training techniques impact performance on language modeling and downstream tasks.

Current formats, such as pickle and other binary formats, have significant problems, such as reliability, safety, and transparency issues. In contrast, PyMilo serializes ML models in a transparent non-executable format, enabling straightforward and safe model exchange, while also facilitating the deserialization and deployment of exported models in production environments. This package aims to provide a seamless, end-to-end solution for the exportation and importation of pre-trained ML models, which simplifies the model development and deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge when adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks or domains. Conventional fine-tuning often overwrites existing knowledge, causing performance degradation on original tasks. We introduce Superposition in Transformers, a novel architecture that leverages autoencoders to superimpose the hidden representations of a base model and a fine-tuned model within a shared parameter space. By using B-spline-based blending coefficients and autoencoders that adaptively reconstruct hidden states based on the input data distribution, our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables a new paradigm of "in-model" superposition. This approach preserves original model capabilities while allowing compact domain-specific expertise to be added, and it supports dynamic switching between model states during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harit Vishwakarma, Alan Mishler, Thomas Cook, Niccol\`o Dalmasso, Natraj Raman, Sumitra Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are empowering decision-making in several applications, including tool or API usage and answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, they often make overconfident, incorrect predictions, which can be risky in high-stakes settings like healthcare and finance. To mitigate these risks, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP), a model-agnostic framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. CP transforms a \emph{score function} into prediction sets that contain the true answer with high probability. While CP provides this coverage guarantee for arbitrary scores, the score quality significantly impacts prediction set sizes. Prior works have relied on LLM logits or other heuristic scores, lacking quality guarantees. We address this limitation by introducing CP-OPT, an optimization framework to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage. Furthermore, inspired by the Monty Hall problem, we extend CP's utility beyond uncertainty quantification to improve accuracy. We propose \emph{conformal revision of questions} (CROQ) to revise the problem by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set. The coverage guarantee of CP ensures that the correct choice is in the revised question prompt with high probability, while the smaller number of choices increases the LLM's chances of answering it correctly. Experiments on MMLU, ToolAlpaca, and TruthfulQA datasets with Gemma-2, Llama-3 and Phi-3 models show that CP-OPT significantly reduces set sizes while maintaining coverage, and CROQ improves accuracy over the standard inference, especially when paired with CP-OPT scores. Together, CP-OPT and CROQ offer a robust framework for improving both the safety and accuracy of LLM-driven decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, not only in generating human-like text, but also in acquiring knowledge. This highlights the need to go beyond the typical Natural Language Processing downstream benchmarks and asses the various aspects of LLMs including knowledge and reasoning. Numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate LLMs knowledge, but they predominantly focus on the English language. Given that many LLMs are multilingual, relying solely on benchmarking English knowledge is insufficient. To address this issue, we introduce AraSTEM, a new Arabic multiple-choice question dataset aimed at evaluating LLMs knowledge in STEM subjects. The dataset spans a range of topics at different levels which requires models to demonstrate a deep understanding of scientific Arabic in order to achieve high accuracy. Our findings show that publicly available models of varying sizes struggle with this dataset, and underscores the need for more localized language models. The dataset is freely accessible on Hugging Face.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqi Gao, Yixin Liu, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan, Jonathan Bragg, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often focus on a limited set of values and can be resource-intensive. Furthermore, the correlation between values has been largely overlooked and remains underutilized. Our framework addresses this limitation by mining a causal graph that elucidates the implicit relationships among various values within the LLMs. Leveraging the causal graph, we implement two lightweight mechanisms for value steering: prompt template steering and Sparse Autoencoder feature steering, and analyze the effects of altering one value dimension on others. Extensive experiments conducted on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our steering methods.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00595">Unbiased GNN Learning via Fairness-Aware Subgraph Diffusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Alchihabi, Yuhong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in tackling a wide array of graph-related tasks across diverse domains. However, a significant challenge lies in their propensity to generate biased predictions, particularly with respect to sensitive node attributes such as age and gender. These biases, inherent in many machine learning models, are amplified in GNNs due to the message-passing mechanism, which allows nodes to influence each other, rendering the task of making fair predictions notably challenging. This issue is particularly pertinent in critical domains where model fairness holds paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a novel generative Fairness-Aware Subgraph Diffusion (FASD) method for unbiased GNN learning. The method initiates by strategically sampling small subgraphs from the original large input graph, and then proceeds to conduct subgraph debiasing via generative fairness-aware graph diffusion processes based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To effectively diffuse unfairness in the input data, we introduce additional adversary bias perturbations to the subgraphs during the forward diffusion process, and train score-based models to predict these applied perturbations, enabling them to learn the underlying dynamics of the biases present in the data. Subsequently, the trained score-based models are utilized to further debias the original subgraph samples through the reverse diffusion process. Finally, FASD induces fair node predictions on the input graph by performing standard GNN learning on the debiased subgraphs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art Fair GNN baselines across multiple benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have recently exhibited remarkable capabilities in general video understanding. However, they mainly focus on holistic comprehension and struggle with capturing fine-grained spatial and temporal details. Besides, the lack of high-quality object-level video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark further hinders their advancements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the VideoRefer Suite to empower Video LLM for finer-level spatial-temporal video understanding, i.e., enabling perception and reasoning on any objects throughout the video. Specially, we thoroughly develop VideoRefer Suite across three essential aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. Firstly, we introduce a multi-agent data engine to meticulously curate a large-scale, high-quality object-level video instruction dataset, termed VideoRefer-700K. Next, we present the VideoRefer model, which equips a versatile spatial-temporal object encoder to capture precise regional and sequential representations. Finally, we meticulously create a VideoRefer-Bench to comprehensively assess the spatial-temporal understanding capability of a Video LLM, evaluating it across various aspects. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our VideoRefer model not only achieves promising performance on video referring benchmarks but also facilitates general video understanding capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthesizing photo-realistic visual observations from an ego vehicle's driving trajectory is a critical step towards scalable training of self-driving models. Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and street view images demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biomedical imaging modalities often produce high-resolution, multi-dimensional images that pose computational challenges for deep neural networks. These computational challenges are compounded when training transformers due to the self-attention operator, which scales quadratically with context length. Recent developments in long-context models have potential to alleviate these difficulties and enable more efficient application of transformers to large biomedical images, although a systematic evaluation on this topic is lacking. In this study, we investigate the impact of context length on biomedical image analysis and we evaluate the performance of recently proposed long-context models. We first curate a suite of biomedical imaging datasets, including 2D and 3D data for segmentation, denoising, and classification tasks. We then analyze the impact of context length on network performance using the Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer by varying patch size and attention window size. Our findings reveal a strong relationship between context length and performance, particularly for pixel-level prediction tasks. Finally, we show that recent long-context models demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency while maintaining comparable performance, though we highlight where gaps remain. This work underscores the potential and challenges of using long-context models in biomedical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinician notes are a rich source of patient information but often contain inconsistencies due to varied writing styles, colloquialisms, abbreviations, medical jargon, grammatical errors, and non-standard formatting. These inconsistencies hinder the extraction of meaningful data from electronic health records (EHRs), posing challenges for quality improvement, population health, precision medicine, decision support, and research.
  We present a large language model approach to standardizing a corpus of 1,618 clinical notes. Standardization corrected an average of $4.9 +/- 1.8$ grammatical errors, $3.3 +/- 5.2$ spelling errors, converted $3.1 +/- 3.0$ non-standard terms to standard terminology, and expanded $15.8 +/- 9.1$ abbreviations and acronyms per note. Additionally, notes were re-organized into canonical sections with standardized headings. This process prepared notes for key concept extraction, mapping to medical ontologies, and conversion to interoperable data formats such as FHIR.
  Expert review of randomly sampled notes found no significant data loss after standardization. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that standardization of clinical notes can improve their readability, consistency, and usability, while also facilitating their conversion into interoperable data formats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Behrouz, Peilin Zhong, Vahab Mirrokni</p>
<p>Abstract: Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length context. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current context while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory has the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a new family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzi Xu, Amir Tavanaei, Kavosh Asadi, Karim Bouyarmane</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite very fast progress, efficiently training large language models (LLMs) in very long contexts remains challenging. Existing methods fall back to training LLMs with short contexts (a maximum of a few thousands tokens in training) and use inference time techniques when evaluating on long contexts (above 1M tokens context window at inference). As opposed to long-context-inference, training on very long context input prompts is quickly limited by GPU memory availability and by the prohibitively long training times it requires on state-of-the-art hardware. Meanwhile, many real-life applications require not only inference but also training/fine-tuning with long context on specific tasks. Such applications include, for example, augmenting the context with various sources of raw reference information for fact extraction, fact summarization, or fact reconciliation tasks. We propose adjoint sharding, a novel technique that comprises sharding gradient calculation during training to reduce memory requirements by orders of magnitude, making training on very long context computationally tractable. Adjoint sharding is based on the adjoint method and computes equivalent gradients to backpropagation. We also propose truncated adjoint sharding to speed up the algorithm while maintaining performance. We provide a distributed version, and a paralleled version of adjoint sharding to further speed up training. Empirical results show the proposed adjoint sharding algorithm reduces memory usage by up to 3X with a 1.27B parameter large language model on 1M context length training. This allows to increase the maximum context length during training or fine-tuning of a 1.27B parameter model from 35K tokens to above 100K tokens on a training infrastructure composed of five AWS P4 instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Zeng, Sanshuai Cui, Biwei Chen, Anjie Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples' (AE) transferability refers to the phenomenon that AEs crafted with one surrogate model can also fool other models. Notwithstanding remarkable progress in untargeted transferability, its targeted counterpart remains challenging. This paper proposes an everywhere scheme to boost targeted transferability. Our idea is to attack a victim image both globally and locally. We aim to optimize 'an army of targets' in every local image region instead of the previous works that optimize a high-confidence target in the image. Specifically, we split a victim image into non-overlap blocks and jointly mount a targeted attack on each block. Such a strategy mitigates transfer failures caused by attention inconsistency between surrogate and victim models and thus results in stronger transferability. Our approach is method-agnostic, which means it can be easily combined with existing transferable attacks for even higher transferability. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed approach universally improves the state-of-the-art targeted attacks by a clear margin, e.g., the transferability of the widely adopted Logit attack can be improved by 28.8%-300%.We also evaluate the crafted AEs on a real-world platform: Google Cloud Vision. Results further support the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhexiong Liu, Diane Litman, Elaine Wang, Tianwen Li, Mason Gobat, Lindsay Clare Matsumura, Richard Correnti</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to revise essays in response to feedback is important for students' writing success. An automated writing evaluation (AWE) system that supports students in revising their essays is thus essential. We present eRevise+RF, an enhanced AWE system for assessing student essay revisions (e.g., changes made to an essay to improve its quality in response to essay feedback) and providing revision feedback. We deployed the system with 6 teachers and 406 students across 3 schools in Pennsylvania and Louisiana. The results confirmed its effectiveness in (1) assessing student essays in terms of evidence usage, (2) extracting evidence and reasoning revisions across essays, and (3) determining revision success in responding to feedback. The evaluation also suggested eRevise+RF is a helpful system for young students to improve their argumentative writing skills through revision and formative feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanzhi Xu, Langyi Chen, Vincent Qu, Haodong Chen, Vera Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengran Li, Chaojun Ding, Junzhou Chen, Wenbin Xing, Cong Ye, Ronghui Zhang, Songlin Zhuang, Jia Hu, Tony Z. Qiu, Huijun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing attribute issues are prevalent in the graph learning, leading to biased outcomes in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing methods that rely on feature propagation are prone to cold start problem, particularly when dealing with attribute resetting and low-degree nodes, which hinder effective propagation and convergence. To address these challenges, we propose AttriReBoost (ARB), a novel method that incorporates propagation-based method to mitigate cold start problems in attribute-missing graphs. ARB enhances global feature propagation by redefining initial boundary conditions and strategically integrating virtual edges, thereby improving node connectivity and ensuring more stable and efficient convergence. This method facilitates gradient-free attribute reconstruction with lower computational overhead. The proposed method is theoretically grounded, with its convergence rigorously established. Extensive experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ARB, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 5.11% over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARB exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, processing a large-scale graph with 2.49 million nodes in just 16 seconds on a single GPU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyang Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Liu, Wing Hung Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal inference in observational studies with high-dimensional covariates presents significant challenges. We introduce CausalBGM, an AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach that captures the causal relationship among covariates, treatment, and outcome variables. The core innovation of CausalBGM lies in its ability to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by learning individual-specific distributions of a low-dimensional latent feature set (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and outcome. This approach not only effectively mitigates confounding effects but also provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, offering reliable and interpretable causal effect estimates at the individual level. CausalBGM adopts a Bayesian model and uses a novel iterative algorithm to update the model parameters and the posterior distribution of latent features until convergence. This framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among variables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale datasets. Its Bayesian foundation ensures statistical rigor, providing robust and well-calibrated posterior intervals. By addressing key limitations of existing methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for advancing causal inference in modern applications in fields such as genomics, healthcare, and social sciences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshi Zheng, Jiazheng Wang, Zihao Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Hang Yin, Zheye Deng, Yangqiu Song, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers, as a fundamental deep learning architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning. This paper investigates the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and explores ways to improve it. The first-order reasoning capability of transformers is assessed through their ability to perform first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) the unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, enabling a characterization of fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset show that transformers outperform previous methods specifically designed for this task and provide detailed empirical evidence on the impact of input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our findings reveal a mismatch between positional encoding and other design choices in transformer architectures employed in prior practices. This discovery motivates us to propose a more sophisticated, logic-aware architecture, TEGA, to enhance the capability for generalizable first-order logical entailment in transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Li, Yuming Xu, Chen Jason Zhang, Alexander Zhou, Lei Chen, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huyen Nguyen, Hieu Dam, Nguyen Do, Cong Tran, Cuong Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: In social online platforms, identifying influential seed users to maximize influence spread is a crucial as it can greatly diminish the cost and efforts required for information dissemination. While effective, traditional methods for Multiplex Influence Maximization (MIM) have reached their performance limits, prompting the emergence of learning-based approaches. These novel methods aim for better generalization and scalability for more sizable graphs but face significant challenges, such as (1) inability to handle unknown diffusion patterns and (2) reliance on high-quality training samples. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced Expert Maximization framework (REM). REM leverages a Propagation Mixture of Experts technique to encode dynamic propagation of large multiplex networks effectively in order to generate enhanced influence propagation. Noticeably, REM treats a generative model as a policy to autonomously generate different seed sets and learn how to improve them from a Reinforcement Learning perspective. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that REM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of influence spread, scalability, and inference time in influence maximization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammet Anil Yagiz, Polat Goktas</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems necessitates advanced, interpretable, and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) to combat emerging cyber threats. Traditional IDS face challenges such as high computational demands, limited explainability, and inflexibility against evolving attack patterns. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Lightweight Explainable Network Security framework (LENS-XAI), which combines robust intrusion detection with enhanced interpretability and scalability. LENS-XAI integrates knowledge distillation, variational autoencoder models, and attribution-based explainability techniques to achieve high detection accuracy and transparency in decision-making. By leveraging a training set comprising 10% of the available data, the framework optimizes computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoTset, UKM-IDS20, CTU-13, and NSL-KDD, demonstrates the framework's superior performance, achieving detection accuracies of 95.34%, 99.92%, 98.42%, and 99.34%, respectively. Additionally, the framework excels in reducing false positives and adapting to complex attack scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Key strengths of LENS-XAI include its lightweight design, suitable for resource-constrained environments, and its scalability across diverse IIoT and cybersecurity contexts. Moreover, the explainability module enhances trust and transparency, critical for practical deployment in dynamic and sensitive applications. This research contributes significantly to advancing IDS by addressing computational efficiency, feature interpretability, and real-world applicability. Future work could focus on extending the framework to ensemble AI systems for distributed environments, further enhancing its robustness and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonard Pu\v{s}k\'a\v{c}, Marek Benovi\v{c}, Jakub Breier, Xiaolu Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network models implemented in embedded devices have been shown to be susceptible to side-channel attacks (SCAs), allowing recovery of proprietary model parameters, such as weights and biases. There are already available countermeasure methods currently used for protecting cryptographic implementations that can be tailored to protect embedded neural network models. Shuffling, a hiding-based countermeasure that randomly shuffles the order of computations, was shown to be vulnerable to SCA when the Fisher-Yates algorithm is used. In this paper, we propose a design of an SCA-secure version of the Fisher-Yates algorithm. By integrating the masking technique for modular reduction and Blakely's method for modular multiplication, we effectively remove the vulnerability in the division operation that led to side-channel leakage in the original version of the algorithm. We experimentally evaluate that the countermeasure is effective against SCA by implementing a correlation power analysis attack on an embedded neural network model implemented on ARM Cortex-M4. Compared to the original proposal, the memory overhead is $2\times$ the biggest layer of the network, while the time overhead varies from $4\%$ to $0.49\%$ for a layer with $100$ and $1000$ neurons, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Tang, Lishuang Li, Liteng Mi, Haiming Wu, Hongbin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot event-relational reasoning is an important task in natural language processing, and existing methods jointly learn a variety of event-relational prefixes and inference-form prefixes to achieve such tasks. However, training prefixes consumes large computational resources and lacks interpretability. Additionally, learning various relational and inferential knowledge inefficiently exploits the connections between tasks. Therefore, we first propose a method for Reasoning-Oriented Locating and Editing (ROLE), which locates and edits the key modules of the language model for reasoning about event relations, enhancing interpretability and also resource-efficiently optimizing the reasoning ability. Subsequently, we propose a method for Analogy-Based Locating and Editing (ABLE), which efficiently exploits the similarities and differences between tasks to optimize the zero-shot reasoning capability. Experimental results show that ROLE improves interpretability and reasoning performance with reduced computational cost. ABLE achieves SOTA results in zero-shot reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Luo, Yebo Feng, Jiahua Xu, Paolo Tasca, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryptocurrency investment is inherently difficult due to its shorter history compared to traditional assets, the need to integrate vast amounts of data from various modalities, and the requirement for complex reasoning. While deep learning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their black-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due to their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable decisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive tasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in their training corpora.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses specialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks such as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making for the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training module fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional investment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs real-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique intrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by adjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and facilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data from November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework outperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset pricing, portfolio, and explainability performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely used for searching optimal solutions in complex multi-component applications. Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes $\mu$MOEA, the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), $\mu$MOEA promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, $\mu$MOEA integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM's quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate $\mu$MOEA in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that $\mu$MOEA can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.</p>

We compare LLM+AL against state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Ultra 1.0, and o1-preview, using benchmarks for complex reasoning about actions. Our findings indicate that, although all methods exhibit errors, LLM+AL, with relatively minimal human corrections, consistently leads to correct answers, whereas standalone LLMs fail to improve even with human feedback. LLM+AL also contributes to automated generation of action languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Ye, Tao Chen, Miqing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern configurable systems provide tremendous opportunities for engineering future intelligent software systems. A key difficulty thereof is how to effectively self-adapt the configuration of a running system such that its performance (e.g., runtime and throughput) can be optimized under time-varying workloads. This unfortunately remains unaddressed in existing approaches as they either overlook the available past knowledge or rely on static exploitation of past knowledge without reasoning the usefulness of information when planning for self-adaptation. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by proposing DLiSA, a framework that self-adapts configurable systems. DLiSA comes with two properties: firstly, it supports lifelong planning, and thereby the planning process runs continuously throughout the lifetime of the system, allowing dynamic exploitation of the accumulated knowledge for rapid adaptation. Secondly, the planning for a newly emerged workload is boosted via distilled knowledge seeding, in which the knowledge is dynamically purified such that only useful past configurations are seeded when necessary, mitigating misleading information. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed DLiSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating a performance improvement of up to 229% and a resource acceleration of up to 2.22x on generating promising adaptation configurations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Kathleen M. Carley</p>
<p>Abstract: Chatter on social media is 20% bots and 80% humans. Chatter by bots and humans is consistently different: bots tend to use linguistic cues that can be easily automated while humans use cues that require dialogue understanding. Bots use words that match the identities they choose to present, while humans may send messages that are not related to the identities they present. Bots and humans differ in their communication structure: sampled bots have a star interaction structure, while sampled humans have a hierarchical structure. These conclusions are based on a large-scale analysis of social media tweets across ~200mil users across 7 events. Social media bots took the world by storm when social-cybersecurity researchers realized that social media users not only consisted of humans but also of artificial agents called bots. These bots wreck havoc online by spreading disinformation and manipulating narratives. Most research on bots are based on special-purposed definitions, mostly predicated on the event studied. This article first begins by asking, "What is a bot?", and we study the underlying principles of how bots are different from humans. We develop a first-principle definition of a social media bot. With this definition as a premise, we systematically compare characteristics between bots and humans across global events, and reflect on how the software-programmed bot is an Artificial Intelligent algorithm, and its potential for evolution as technology advances. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for the use and regulation of bots. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions: Detect, to systematically identify these automated and potentially evolving bots; Differentiate, to evaluate the goodness of the bot in terms of their content postings and relationship interactions; Disrupt, to moderate the impact of malicious bots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Shao, Mingyang Liu, Linqi Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The embedded topic model (ETM) is a widely used approach that assumes the sampled document-topic distribution conforms to the logistic normal distribution for easier optimization. However, this assumption oversimplifies the real document-topic distribution, limiting the model's performance. In response, we propose a novel method that introduces the diffusion process into the sampling process of document-topic distribution to overcome this limitation and maintain an easy optimization process. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two mainstream datasets, proving its effectiveness in improving topic modeling performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Li, Zhiguang Cao, Yining Ma, Yaoxin Wu, Yue-Jiao Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing neural methods for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) mostly aim at finding a single optimal solution. To discover diverse yet high-quality solutions for Multi-Solution TSP (MSTSP), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning based neural solver, which is primarily featured by an encoder-decoder structured policy. Concretely, on the one hand, a Relativization Filter (RF) is designed to enhance the robustness of the encoder to affine transformations of the instances, so as to potentially improve the quality of the found solutions. On the other hand, a Multi-Attentive Adaptive Active Search (MA3S) is tailored to allow the decoders to strike a balance between the optimality and diversity. Experimental evaluations on benchmark instances demonstrate the superiority of our method over recent neural baselines across different metrics, and its competitive performance against state-of-the-art traditional heuristics with significantly reduced computational time, ranging from $1.3\times$ to $15\times$ faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can also be applied to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00885">Representation in large language models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron C. Yetman</p>
<p>Abstract: The extraordinary success of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse array of tasks has led to an explosion of scientific and philosophical theorizing aimed at explaining how they do what they do. Unfortunately, disagreement over fundamental theoretical issues has led to stalemate, with entrenched camps of LLM optimists and pessimists often committed to very different views of how these systems work. Overcoming stalemate requires agreement on fundamental questions, and the goal of this paper is to address one such question, namely: is LLM behavior driven partly by representation-based information processing of the sort implicated in biological cognition, or is it driven entirely by processes of memorization and stochastic table look-up? This is a question about what kind of algorithm LLMs implement, and the answer carries serious implications for higher level questions about whether these systems have beliefs, intentions, concepts, knowledge, and understanding. I argue that LLM behavior is partially driven by representation-based information processing, and then I describe and defend a series of practical techniques for investigating these representations and developing explanations on their basis. The resulting account provides a groundwork for future theorizing about language models and their successors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohua Li, Maoli Liu, Xiangxiang Dai, John C. S. Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: The contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is crucial in sequential decision-making. A line of research, known as online clustering of bandits, extends contextual MAB by grouping similar users into clusters, utilizing shared features to improve learning efficiency. However, existing algorithms, which rely on the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy, struggle to gather adequate statistical information to accurately identify unknown user clusters. As a result, their theoretical analyses require several strong assumptions about the "diversity" of contexts generated by the environment, leading to impractical settings, complicated analyses, and poor practical performance. Removing these assumptions has been a long-standing open problem in the clustering of bandits literature. In this paper, we provide two solutions to this open problem. First, following the i.i.d. context generation setting in existing studies, we propose two novel algorithms, UniCLUB and PhaseUniCLUB, which incorporate enhanced exploration mechanisms to accelerate cluster identification. Remarkably, our algorithms require substantially weaker assumptions while achieving regret bounds comparable to prior work. Second, inspired by the smoothed analysis framework, we propose a more practical setting that eliminates the requirement for i.i.d. context generation used in previous studies, thus enhancing the performance of existing algorithms for online clustering of bandits. Our technique can be applied to both graph-based and set-based clustering of bandits frameworks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms consistently outperform existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Talha Zeeshan, Abhishek Kumar, Susanna Pirttikangas, Sasu Tarkoma</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Large Language Model (LLM), also known as foundation models, based multi-agent system framework for complex event processing (CEP) with a focus on video query processing use cases. The primary goal is to create a proof-of-concept (POC) that integrates state-of-the-art LLM orchestration frameworks with publish/subscribe (pub/sub) tools to address the integration of LLMs with current CEP systems. Utilizing the Autogen framework in conjunction with Kafka message brokers, the system demonstrates an autonomous CEP pipeline capable of handling complex workflows. Extensive experiments evaluate the system's performance across varying configurations, complexities, and video resolutions, revealing the trade-offs between functionality and latency. The results show that while higher agent count and video complexities increase latency, the system maintains high consistency in narrative coherence. This research builds upon and contributes to, existing novel approaches to distributed AI systems, offering detailed insights into integrating such systems into existing infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Han Meng, Zhenyu Bi, Ingolv T. Urnes, Haipeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising ability in generating high-quality time series (TS) data. Despite the initial success, existing works mostly focus on the authenticity of data at the individual level, but pay less attention to preserving the population-level properties on the entire dataset. Such population-level properties include value distributions for each dimension and distributions of certain functional dependencies (e.g., cross-correlation, CC) between different dimensions. For instance, when generating house energy consumption TS data, the value distributions of the outside temperature and the kitchen temperature should be preserved, as well as the distribution of CC between them. Preserving such TS population-level properties is critical in maintaining the statistical insights of the datasets, mitigating model bias, and augmenting downstream tasks like TS prediction. Yet, it is often overlooked by existing models. Hence, data generated by existing models often bear distribution shifts from the original data. We propose Population-aware Diffusion for Time Series (PaD-TS), a new TS generation model that better preserves the population-level properties. The key novelties of PaD-TS include 1) a new training method explicitly incorporating TS population-level property preservation, and 2) a new dual-channel encoder model architecture that better captures the TS data structure. Empirical results in major benchmark datasets show that PaD-TS can improve the average CC distribution shift score between real and synthetic data by 5.9x while maintaining a performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on individual-level authenticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongming Zhang, Fengshuo Bai, Chenjun Xiao, Chao Gao, Bo Xu, Martin M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: While many sophisticated exploration methods have been proposed, their lack of generality and high computational cost often lead researchers to favor simpler methods like $\epsilon$-greedy. Motivated by this, we introduce $\beta$-DQN, a simple and efficient exploration method that augments the standard DQN with a behavior function $\beta$. This function estimates the probability that each action has been taken at each state. By leveraging $\beta$, we generate a population of diverse policies that balance exploration between state-action coverage and overestimation bias correction. An adaptive meta-controller is designed to select an effective policy for each episode, enabling flexible and explainable exploration. $\beta$-DQN is straightforward to implement and adds minimal computational overhead to the standard DQN. Experiments on both simple and challenging exploration domains show that $\beta$-DQN outperforms existing baseline methods across a wide range of tasks, providing an effective solution for improving exploration in deep reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Casey Kennington, Pierre Lison, David Schlangen</p>
<p>Abstract: Efforts towards endowing robots with the ability to speak have benefited from recent advancements in NLP, in particular large language models. However, as powerful as current models have become, they still operate on sentence or multi-sentence level input, not on the word-by-word input that humans operate on, affecting the degree of responsiveness that they offer, which is critical in situations where humans interact with robots using speech. In this paper, we review the literature on interactive systems that operate incrementally (i.e., at the word level or below it). We motivate the need for incremental systems, survey incremental modeling of important aspects of dialogue like speech recognition and language generation. Primary focus is on the part of the system that makes decisions, known as the dialogue manager. We find that there is very little research on incremental dialogue management, offer some requirements for practical incremental dialogue management, and the implications of incremental dialogue for embodied, robotic platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagarnil Das, Pradeep Walia</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness. Early detection at the DR1 stage is critical but is hindered by a scarcity of high-quality fundus images. This study uses StyleGAN3 to generate synthetic DR1 images characterized by microaneurysms with high fidelity and diversity. The aim is to address data scarcity and enhance the performance of supervised classifiers. A dataset of 2,602 DR1 images was used to train the model, followed by a comprehensive evaluation using quantitative metrics, including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Equivariance with respect to translation (EQ-T) and rotation (EQ-R). Qualitative assessments included Human Turing tests, where trained ophthalmologists evaluated the realism of synthetic images. Spectral analysis further validated image quality. The model achieved a final FID score of 17.29, outperforming the mean FID of 21.18 (95 percent confidence interval - 20.83 to 21.56) derived from bootstrap resampling. Human Turing tests demonstrated the model's ability to produce highly realistic images, though minor artifacts near the borders were noted. These findings suggest that StyleGAN3-generated synthetic DR1 images hold significant promise for augmenting training datasets, enabling more accurate early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy. This methodology highlights the potential of synthetic data in advancing medical imaging and AI-driven diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu You, Haocheng Dai, Yifei Min, Jasjeet S. Sekhon, Sarang Joshi, James S. Duncan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them, like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on \textit{atypical} examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we articulate the hypothesis: the imbalanced group performance is a byproduct of ``noisy'' spurious memorization confined to a small set of neurons. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Ravenda, Seyed Ali Bahrainian, Andrea Raballo, Antonietta Mira, Noriko Kando</p>
<p>Abstract: In psychological practice, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental constructs (e.g., attitudes, traits, and emotions) through structured questions (aka items). With the increasing prevalence of social media platforms where users share personal experiences and emotions, researchers are exploring computational methods to leverage this data for rapid mental health screening. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that completes psychological questionnaires by analyzing social media posts. Our method retrieves the most relevant user posts for each question in a psychological survey and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict questionnaire scores in a zero-shot setting. Our findings are twofold. First we demonstrate that this approach can effectively predict users' responses to psychological questionnaires, such as the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art models on Reddit-based benchmark datasets without relying on training data. Second, we show how this methodology can be generalized as a scalable screening tool, as the final assessment is systematically derived by completing standardized questionnaires and tracking how individual item responses contribute to the diagnosis, aligning with established psychometric practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Adamczyk, Volodymyr Makarenko, Stas Tiomkin, Rahul V. Kulkarni</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, especially in sparse-reward domains, many environment steps are required to observe reward information. In order to increase the frequency of such observations, "potential-based reward shaping" (PBRS) has been proposed as a method of providing a more dense reward signal while leaving the optimal policy invariant. However, the required "potential function" must be carefully designed with task-dependent knowledge to not deter training performance. In this work, we propose a "bootstrapped" method of reward shaping, termed BSRS, in which the agent's current estimate of the state-value function acts as the potential function for PBRS. We provide convergence proofs for the tabular setting, give insights into training dynamics for deep RL, and show that the proposed method improves training speed in the Atari suite.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Yang, Zhengyu Qi, Zhaochun Ren, Zhikai Jia, Haizhou Sun, Xiaofei Zhu, Xiangwen Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks by understanding input information and predicting corresponding outputs. However, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs comprehend input and make effective predictions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing from the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a non-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the following key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task spaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding; (2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at critical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context Learning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances reasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example information into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune LLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection mechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of task space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but also accelerates inference speed by over 40\%, while TS-FT achieves superior results with a minimal strategy adjustment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cloud computing has revolutionized the provisioning of computing resources, offering scalable, flexible, and on-demand services to meet the diverse requirements of modern applications. At the heart of efficient cloud operations are job scheduling and resource management, which are critical for optimizing system performance and ensuring timely and cost-effective service delivery. However, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of cloud environments presents significant challenges for these tasks, as workloads and resource availability can fluctuate unpredictably. Traditional approaches, including heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, often struggle to adapt to these real-time changes due to their reliance on static models or predefined rules. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by enabling systems to learn and adapt policies based on continuous observations of the environment, facilitating intelligent and responsive decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive review of DRL-based algorithms for job scheduling and resource management in cloud computing, analyzing their methodologies, performance metrics, and practical applications. We also highlight emerging trends and future research directions, offering valuable insights into leveraging DRL to advance both job scheduling and resource management in cloud computing.</p>

Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of data and advancements in big data technologies have created a demand for more efficient and automated approaches to data analysis and storytelling. However, automated data analysis systems still face challenges in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for data insight discovery, augmented analysis, and data storytelling. This paper introduces the Multidimensional Data Storytelling Framework (MDSF) based on large language models for automated insight generation and context-aware storytelling. The framework incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques, augmented analysis algorithms, and a unique scoring mechanism to identify and prioritize actionable insights. The use of fine-tuned LLMs enhances contextual understanding and generates narratives with minimal manual intervention. The architecture also includes an agent-based mechanism for real-time storytelling continuation control. Key findings reveal that MDSF outperforms existing methods across various datasets in terms of insight ranking accuracy, descriptive quality, and narrative coherence. The experimental evaluation demonstrates MDSF's ability to automate complex analytical tasks, reduce interpretive biases, and improve user satisfaction. User studies further underscore its practical utility in enhancing content structure, conclusion extraction, and richness of detail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopeng Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) has shown remarkable successes in many domains by taking advantage of powerful deep neural networks. Deep neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks and could be easily fooled by adversarial examples. The current progress on this robustness issue is mainly about deep classification models but pays little attention to DML models. Existing works fail to thoroughly inspect the robustness of DML and neglect an important DML scenario, the clustering-based inference. In this work, we first point out the robustness issue of DML models in clustering-based inference scenarios. We find that, for the clustering-based inference, existing defenses designed DML are unable to be reused and the adaptions of defenses designed for deep classification models cannot achieve satisfactory robustness performance. To alleviate the hazard of adversarial examples, we propose a new defense, the Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT), which exploits ensemble learning and adversarial training. EAT promotes the diversity of the ensemble, encouraging each model in the ensemble to have different robustness features, and employs a self-transferring mechanism to make full use of the robustness statistics of the whole ensemble in the update of every single model. We evaluate the EAT method on three widely-used datasets with two popular model architectures. The results show that the proposed EAT method greatly outperforms the adaptions of defenses designed for deep classification models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning is fundamental to human intelligence, and critical for problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking. Reasoning refers to drawing new conclusions based on existing knowledge, which can support various applications like clinical diagnosis, basic education, and financial analysis. Though a good number of surveys have been proposed for reviewing reasoning-related methods, none of them has systematically investigated these methods from the viewpoint of their dependent knowledge base. Both the scenarios to which the knowledge bases are applied and their storage formats are significantly different. Hence, investigating reasoning methods from the knowledge base perspective helps us better understand the challenges and future directions. To fill this gap, this paper first classifies the knowledge base into symbolic and parametric ones. The former explicitly stores information in human-readable symbols, and the latter implicitly encodes knowledge within parameters. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of reasoning methods using symbolic knowledge bases, parametric knowledge bases, and both of them. Finally, we identify the future direction toward enhancing reasoning capabilities to bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonduk Seo, Zonghao Yuan, Yi Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to their tendency to embed Western-centric biases from training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness issues in cross-cultural contexts. Recent approaches, such as role-assignment and few-shot learning, often struggle with reliable cultural alignment as they heavily rely on pre-trained knowledge, lack scalability, and fail to capture nuanced cultural values effectively. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with in-context learning to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. Subsequently, we curated several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. ValuesRAG consistently outperforms baseline methods, both in the main experiment and in the ablation study where only the values summary was provided, highlighting ValuesRAG's potential to foster culturally aligned AI systems and enhance the inclusivity of AI-driven applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshuai Hao, Guanqun Liu, Yuting Zhao, Yuheng Ji, Mengchuan Wei, Haimei Zhao, Lingdong Kong, Rong Yin, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion models play a crucial role in autonomous driving perception, particularly in tasks like 3D object detection and HD map construction. These models provide essential and comprehensive static environmental information for autonomous driving systems. While camera-LiDAR fusion methods have shown promising results by integrating data from both modalities, they often depend on complete sensor inputs. This reliance can lead to low robustness and potential failures when sensors are corrupted or missing, raising significant safety concerns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the Multi-Sensor Corruption Benchmark (MSC-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark aimed at evaluating the robustness of multi-sensor autonomous driving perception models against various sensor corruptions. Our benchmark includes 16 combinations of corruption types that disrupt both camera and LiDAR inputs, either individually or concurrently. Extensive evaluations of six 3D object detection models and four HD map construction models reveal substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions and sensor failures, underscoring critical safety issues. The benchmark toolkit and affiliated code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixing Xu, Shivank Nag, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs have achieved exceptional performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, the standard self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic time complexity and linearly increased cache size. Sliding window attention (SWA) solves this problem by restricting the attention range to a fixed-size local context window. Nevertheless, SWA employs a uniform window size for each head in each layer, making it inefficient in capturing context of varying scales. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Multi-Scale Window Attention (MSWA) which applies diverse window sizes across heads and layers in the Transformer. It not only allows for different window sizes among heads within the same layer but also progressively increases window size allocation from shallow to deep layers, thus enabling the model to capture contextual information with different lengths and distances. Experimental results on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks substantiate that MSWA outperforms traditional local attention in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rida Qadri, Aida M. Davani, Kevin Robinson, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly being integrated into applications that shape the production and discovery of societal knowledge such as search, online education, and travel planning. As a result, language models will shape how people learn about, perceive and interact with global cultures making it important to consider whose knowledge systems and perspectives are represented in models. Recognizing this importance, increasingly work in Machine Learning and NLP has focused on evaluating gaps in global cultural representational distribution within outputs. However, more work is needed on developing benchmarks for cross-cultural impacts of language models that stem from a nuanced sociologically-aware conceptualization of cultural impact or harm. We join this line of work arguing for the need of metricizable evaluations of language technologies that interrogate and account for historical power inequities and differential impacts of representation on global cultures, particularly for cultures already under-represented in the digital corpora. We look at two concepts of erasure: omission: where cultures are not represented at all and simplification i.e. when cultural complexity is erased by presenting one-dimensional views of a rich culture. The former focuses on whether something is represented, and the latter on how it is represented. We focus our analysis on two task contexts with the potential to influence global cultural production. First, we probe representations that a language model produces about different places around the world when asked to describe these contexts. Second, we analyze the cultures represented in the travel recommendations produced by a set of language model applications. Our study shows ways in which the NLP community and application developers can begin to operationalize complex socio-cultural considerations into standard evaluations and benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohui Chen, Yinkai Wang, Jiaxing He, Yuanqi Du, Soha Hassoun, Xiaolin Xu, Li-Ping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph generation is a critical task in numerous domains, including molecular design and social network analysis, due to its ability to model complex relationships and structured data. While most modern graph generative models utilize adjacency matrix representations, this work revisits an alternative approach that represents graphs as sequences of node set and edge set. We advocate for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, we introduce the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, we explore fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets. Results indicate that G2PT achieves superior generative performance on both generic graph and molecule datasets. Furthermore, G2PT exhibits strong adaptability and versatility in downstream tasks from molecular design to property prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhwan Choi, Kyu Won Kim, Myungjoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Multimodal Matching based on Valence and Arousal (MMVA), a tri-modal encoder framework designed to capture emotional content across images, music, and musical captions. To support this framework, we expand the Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet) dataset, creating IMEMNet-C which includes 24,756 images and 25,944 music clips with corresponding musical captions. We employ multimodal matching scores based on the continuous valence (emotional positivity) and arousal (emotional intensity) values. This continuous matching score allows for random sampling of image-music pairs during training by computing similarity scores from the valence-arousal values across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in valence-arousal prediction tasks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in various zeroshot tasks, highlighting the potential of valence and arousal predictions in downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Dai, Zhiyong Wu, Shiyin Kang, Xixin Wu, Jia Jia, Dan Su, Dong Yu, Helen Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion serves as an essential component in Chinese Mandarin text-to-speech (TTS) system, where polyphone disambiguation is the core issue. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework to predict the pronunciation of a polyphonic character, which accepts sentence containing polyphonic character as input in the form of Chinese character sequence without the necessity of any preprocessing. The proposed method consists of a pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model and a neural network (NN) based classifier. The pre-trained BERT model extracts semantic features from a raw Chinese character sequence and the NN based classifier predicts the polyphonic character's pronunciation according to BERT output. In out experiments, we implemented three classifiers, a fully-connected network based classifier, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network based classifier and a Transformer block based classifier. The experimental results compared with the baseline approach based on LSTM demonstrate that, the pre-trained model extracts effective semantic features, which greatly enhances the performance of polyphone disambiguation. In addition, we also explored the impact of contextual information on polyphone disambiguation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Dai, Zhiyong Wu, Runnan Li, Xixin Wu, Jia Jia, Helen Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the emotional state from speech is essential for the natural interaction of the machine with the speaker. However, extracting effective features for emotion recognition is difficult, as emotions are ambiguous. We propose a novel approach to learn discriminative features from variable length spectrograms for emotion recognition by cooperating softmax cross-entropy loss and center loss together. The softmax cross-entropy loss enables features from different emotion categories separable, and center loss efficiently pulls the features belonging to the same emotion category to their center. By combining the two losses together, the discriminative power will be highly enhanced, which leads to network learning more effective features for emotion recognition. As demonstrated by the experimental results, after introducing center loss, both the unweighted accuracy and weighted accuracy are improved by over 3\% on Mel-spectrogram input, and more than 4\% on Short Time Fourier Transform spectrogram input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haina Zhu, Yizhi Zhou, Hangting Chen, Jianwei Yu, Ziyang Ma, Rongzhi Gu, Wei Tan, Xie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) in various music informatics understanding tasks, including music tagging, instrument classification, key detection, and more. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset. Code and checkpoints are open source in https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MuQ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiusheng Xu, Lei Qi, Jingyang Zhou, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-Free Domain Generalization (SFDG) aims to develop a model that performs on unseen domains without relying on any source domains. However, the implementation remains constrained due to the unavailability of training data. Research on SFDG focus on knowledge transfer of multi-modal models and style synthesis based on joint space of multiple modalities, thus eliminating the dependency on source domain images. However, existing works primarily work for multi-domain and less-category configuration, but performance on multi-domain and multi-category configuration is relatively poor. In addition, the efficiency of style synthesis also deteriorates in multi-category scenarios. How to efficiently synthesize sufficiently diverse data and apply it to multi-category configuration is a direction with greater practical value. In this paper, we propose a method called BatStyler, which is utilized to improve the capability of style synthesis in multi-category scenarios. BatStyler consists of two modules: Coarse Semantic Generation and Uniform Style Generation modules. The Coarse Semantic Generation module extracts coarse-grained semantics to prevent the compression of space for style diversity learning in multi-category configuration, while the Uniform Style Generation module provides a template of styles that are uniformly distributed in space and implements parallel training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits comparable performance on less-category datasets, while surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multi-category datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jimin Park, AHyun Ji, Minji Park, Mohammad Saidur Rahman, Se Eun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) for malware classification tackles the rapidly evolving nature of malware threats and the frequent emergence of new types. Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time.
  In this paper, we introduce a GR-based CL system that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with feature matching loss to generate high-quality malware samples. Additionally, we implement innovative selection schemes for replay samples based on the model's hidden representations.
  Our comprehensive evaluation across Windows and Android malware datasets in a class-incremental learning scenario -- where new classes are introduced continuously over multiple tasks -- demonstrates substantial performance improvements over previous methods. For example, our system achieves an average accuracy of 55% on Windows malware samples, significantly outperforming other GR-based models by 28%. This study provides practical insights for advancing GR-based malware classification systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rofiqul Islam, Nihad Karim Chowdhury, Muhammad Ashad Kabir</p>
<p>Abstract: This research presents a robust approach to classifying COVID-19 cough sounds using cutting-edge machine-learning techniques. Leveraging deep neural decision trees and deep neural decision forests, our methodology demonstrates consistent performance across diverse cough sound datasets. We begin with a comprehensive extraction of features to capture a wide range of audio features from individuals, whether COVID-19 positive or negative. To determine the most important features, we use recursive feature elimination along with cross-validation. Bayesian optimization fine-tunes hyper-parameters of deep neural decision tree and deep neural decision forest models. Additionally, we integrate the SMOTE during training to ensure a balanced representation of positive and negative data. Model performance refinement is achieved through threshold optimization, maximizing the ROC-AUC score. Our approach undergoes a comprehensive evaluation in five datasets: Cambridge, Coswara, COUGHVID, Virufy, and the combined Virufy with the NoCoCoDa dataset. Consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yields notable AUC scores of 0.97, 0.98, 0.92, 0.93, 0.99, and 0.99 across the respective datasets. Merging all datasets into a combined dataset, our method, using a deep neural decision forest classifier, achieves an AUC of 0.97. Also, our study includes a comprehensive cross-datasets analysis, revealing demographic and geographic differences in the cough sounds associated with COVID-19. These differences highlight the challenges in transferring learned features across diverse datasets and underscore the potential benefits of dataset integration, improving generalizability and enhancing COVID-19 detection from audio signals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient data selection is essential for improving the training efficiency of deep neural networks and reducing the associated annotation costs. However, traditional methods tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. We introduce PruneFuse, a novel method that combines pruning and network fusion to enhance data selection and accelerate network training. In PruneFuse, the original dense network is pruned to generate a smaller surrogate model that efficiently selects the most informative samples from the dataset. Once this iterative data selection selects sufficient samples, the insights learned from the pruned model are seamlessly integrated with the dense model through network fusion, providing an optimized initialization that accelerates training. Extensive experimentation on various datasets demonstrates that PruneFuse significantly reduces computational costs for data selection, achieves better performance than baselines, and accelerates the overall training process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Lang, Zhangtao Cheng, Ting Zhong, Fan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning with incomplete modality is practical and challenging. Recently, researchers have focused on enhancing the robustness of pre-trained MultiModal Transformers (MMTs) under missing modality conditions by applying learnable prompts. However, these prompt-based methods face several limitations: (1) incomplete modalities provide restricted modal cues for task-specific inference, (2) dummy imputation for missing content causes information loss and introduces noise, and (3) static prompts are instance-agnostic, offering limited knowledge for instances with various missing conditions. To address these issues, we propose RAGPT, a novel Retrieval-AuGmented dynamic Prompt Tuning framework. RAGPT comprises three modules: (I) the multi-channel retriever, which identifies similar instances through a within-modality retrieval strategy, (II) the missing modality generator, which recovers missing information using retrieved contexts, and (III) the context-aware prompter, which captures contextual knowledge from relevant instances and generates dynamic prompts to largely enhance the MMT's robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that RAGPT consistently outperforms all competitive baselines in handling incomplete modality problems. The code of our work and prompt-based baselines is available at https://github.com/Jian-Lang/RAGPT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has been attracting attention by methods for modeling multi-turn contexts. The multi-turn input to a pretraining model implicitly assumes that the current turn and other turns are distinguished during the training process by inserting special tokens into the input sequence. This paper proposes a priority-based attention method to distinguish each turn explicitly by adding dialogue features into the attention mechanism, called Turn Emphasis with Dialogue (TED). It has a priority for each turn according to turn position and speaker information as dialogue features. It takes multi-head self-attention between turn-based vectors for multi-turn input and adjusts attention scores with the dialogue features. We evaluate TED on four typical benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that TED has high overall performance in all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP with numerous turns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Mena, Diego Arenas, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) leverages multiple sources or views of data to enhance machine learning model performance and robustness. This approach has been successfully used in the Earth Observation (EO) domain, where views have a heterogeneous nature and can be affected by missing data. Despite the negative effect that missing data has on model predictions, the ML literature has used it as an augmentation technique to improve model generalization, like masking the input data. Inspired by this, we introduce novel methods for EO applications tailored to MVL with missing views. Our methods integrate the combination of a set to simulate all combinations of missing views as different training samples. Instead of replacing missing data with a numerical value, we use dynamic merge functions, like average, and more complex ones like Transformer. This allows the MVL model to entirely ignore the missing views, enhancing its predictive robustness. We experiment on four EO datasets with temporal and static views, including state-of-the-art methods from the EO domain. The results indicate that our methods improve model robustness under conditions of moderate missingness, and improve the predictive performance when all views are present. The proposed methods offer a single adaptive solution to operate effectively with any combination of available views.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for enabling agents to learn complex, coordinated behaviors but faces persistent challenges regarding its generalization, scalability and sample efficiency. Recent advancements have sought to alleviate those issues by embedding intrinsic symmetries of the systems in the policy. Yet, most dynamical systems exhibit little to no symmetries to exploit. This paper presents a novel framework for embedding extrinsic symmetries in multi-agent system dynamics that enables the use of symmetry-enhanced methods to address systems with insufficient intrinsic symmetries, expanding the scope of equivariant learning to a wide variety of MARL problems. Central to our framework is the Group Equivariant Graphormer, a group-modular architecture specifically designed for distributed swarming tasks. Extensive experiments on a swarm of symmetry-breaking quadrotors validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential for improved generalization and zero-shot scalability. Our method achieves significant reductions in collision rates and enhances task success rates across a diverse range of scenarios and varying swarm sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: While generative models such as text-to-image, large language models and text-to-video have seen significant progress, the extension to text-to-virtual-reality remains largely unexplored, due to a deficit in training data and the complexity of achieving realistic depth and motion in virtual environments. This paper proposes an approach to coalesce existing generative systems to form a stereoscopic virtual reality video from text.
  Carried out in three main stages, we start with a base text-to-image model that captures context from an input text. We then employ Stable Diffusion on the rudimentary image produced, to generate frames with enhanced realism and overall quality. These frames are processed with depth estimation algorithms to create left-eye and right-eye views, which are stitched side-by-side to create an immersive viewing experience. Such systems would be highly beneficial in virtual reality production, since filming and scene building often require extensive hours of work and post-production effort.
  We utilize image evaluation techniques, specifically Fr\'echet Inception Distance and CLIP Score, to assess the visual quality of frames produced for the video. These quantitative measures establish the proficiency of the proposed method.
  Our work highlights the exciting possibilities of using natural language-driven graphics in fields like virtual reality simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Palmprint recognition has emerged as a prominent biometric technology, widely applied in diverse scenarios. Traditional handcrafted methods for palmprint recognition often fall short in representation capability, as they heavily depend on researchers' prior knowledge. Deep learning (DL) has been introduced to address this limitation, leveraging its remarkable successes across various domains. While existing surveys focus narrowly on specific tasks within palmprint recognition-often grounded in traditional methodologies-there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research exploring DL-based approaches across all facets of palmprint recognition. This paper bridges that gap by thoroughly reviewing recent advancements in DL-powered palmprint recognition. The paper systematically examines progress across key tasks, including region-of-interest segmentation, feature extraction, and security/privacy-oriented challenges. Beyond highlighting these advancements, the paper identifies current challenges and uncovers promising opportunities for future research. By consolidating state-of-the-art progress, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enabling them to stay abreast of cutting-edge technologies and drive innovation in palmprint recognition.</p>

This short paper primarily focuses on intrinsic bias mitigation and measurement strategies for language models, building on prior research that demonstrates a lack of correlation between intrinsic and extrinsic approaches. We delve deeper into intrinsic measurements, identifying inconsistencies and suggesting that these benchmarks may reflect different facets of gender stereotype. Our methodology involves analyzing data distributions across datasets and integrating gender stereotype components informed by social psychology. By adjusting the distribution of two datasets, we achieve a better alignment of outcomes. Our findings underscore the complexity of gender stereotyping in language models and point to new directions for developing more refined techniques to detect and reduce bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: While 2D pose estimation has advanced our ability to interpret body movements in animals and primates, it is limited by the lack of depth information, constraining its application range. 3D pose estimation provides a more comprehensive solution by incorporating spatial depth, yet creating extensive 3D pose datasets for animals is challenging due to their dynamic and unpredictable behaviours in natural settings. To address this, we propose a hybrid approach that utilizes rigged avatars and the pipeline to generate synthetic datasets to acquire the necessary 3D annotations for training. Our method introduces a simple attention-based MLP network for converting 2D poses to 3D, designed to be independent of the input image to ensure scalability for poses in natural environments. Additionally, we identify that existing anatomical keypoint detectors are insufficient for accurate pose retargeting onto arbitrary avatars. To overcome this, we present a lookup table based on a deep pose estimation method using a synthetic collection of diverse actions rigged avatars perform. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this lookup table-based retargeting approach. Overall, we propose a comprehensive framework with systematically synthesized datasets for lifting poses from 2D to 3D and then utilize this to re-target motion from wild settings onto arbitrary avatars.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disease name normalization is an important task in the medical domain. It classifies disease names written in various formats into standardized names, serving as a fundamental component in smart healthcare systems for various disease-related functions. Nevertheless, the most significant obstacle to existing disease name normalization systems is the severe shortage of training data. Consequently, we present a novel data augmentation approach that includes a series of data augmentation techniques and some supporting modules to help mitigate the problem. Through extensive experimentation, we illustrate that our proposed approach exhibits significant performance improvements across various baseline models and training objectives, particularly in scenarios with limited training data</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Mushtaq, Muhammad Rafay Naeem, Ibrahim Ghaznavi, Muhammad Imran Taj, Imran Hashmi, Junaid Qadir</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to harness collective intelligence in complex problem-solving, decision-making, and planning tasks. This aligns with the concept of the wisdom of crowds, where diverse agents contribute collectively to generating effective solutions, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. Senior design projects, also known as capstone or final year projects, are pivotal in engineering education as they integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects. To assess the efficacy of this framework, we collected six proposals of engineering and computer science of...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uzma Mushtaque</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer based models are increasingly being used in various domains including recommender systems (RS). Pretrained transformer models such as BERT have shown good performance at language modelling. With the greater ability to model sequential tasks, variants of Encoder-only models (like BERT4Rec, SASRec etc.) have found success in sequential RS problems. Computing dot-product attention in traditional transformer models has quadratic complexity in sequence length. This is a bigger problem with RS because unlike language models, new items are added to the catalogue every day. User buying history is a dynamic sequence which depends on multiple factors. Recently, various linear attention models have tried to solve this problem by making the model linear in sequence length (token dimensions). Hydra attention is one such linear complexity model proposed for vision transformers which reduces the complexity of attention for both the number of tokens as well as model embedding dimensions. Building on the idea of Hydra attention, we introduce an efficient Transformer based Sequential RS (HydraRec) which significantly improves theoretical complexity of computing attention for longer sequences and bigger datasets while preserving the temporal context. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate other linear transformer-based RS models and compared with HydraRec across various evaluation metrics. HydraRec outperforms other linear attention-based models as well as dot-product based attention models when used with causal masking for sequential recommendation next item prediction tasks. For bi-directional models its performance is comparable to the BERT4Rec model with an improvement in running time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Faces and humans are crucial elements in social interaction and are widely included in everyday photos and videos. Therefore, a deep understanding of faces and humans will enable multi-modal assistants to achieve improved response quality and broadened application scope. Currently, the multi-modal assistant community lacks a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of face and human understanding abilities. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench comprises a development set with 900 problems and a test set with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. Moreover, inspired by multi-modal agents, we also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiali Wei, Ming Fan, Xicheng Zhang, Wenjing Jiao, Haijun Wang, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Powered by their superior performance, deep neural networks (DNNs) have found widespread applications across various domains. Many deep learning (DL) models are now embedded in mobile apps, making them more accessible to end users through on-device DL. However, deploying on-device DL to users' smartphones simultaneously introduces several security threats. One primary threat is backdoor attacks. Extensive research has explored backdoor attacks for several years and has proposed numerous attack approaches. However, few studies have investigated backdoor attacks on DL models deployed in the real world, or they have shown obvious deficiencies in effectiveness and stealthiness. In this work, we explore more effective and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world DL models extracted from mobile apps. Our main justification is that imperceptible and sample-specific backdoor triggers generated by DNN-based steganography can enhance the efficacy of backdoor attacks on real-world models. We first confirm the effectiveness of steganography-based backdoor attacks on four state-of-the-art DNN models. Subsequently, we systematically evaluate and analyze the stealthiness of the attacks to ensure they are difficult to perceive. Finally, we implement the backdoor attacks on real-world models and compare our approach with three baseline methods. We collect 38,387 mobile apps, extract 89 DL models from them, and analyze these models to obtain the prerequisite model information for the attacks. After identifying the target models, our approach achieves an average of 12.50% higher attack success rate than DeepPayload while better maintaining the normal performance of the models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method enables more effective, robust, and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshuai Song, Yanan Wu, Weixun Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Correction aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-refine their initial responses without external feedback. However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael K\"olle, Johannes Tochtermann, Julian Sch\"onberger, Gerhard Stenzel, Philipp Altmann, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</p>
<p>Abstract: While exploration in single-agent reinforcement learning has been studied extensively in recent years, considerably less work has focused on its counterpart in multi-agent reinforcement learning. To address this issue, this work proposes a peer-incentivized reward function inspired by previous research on intrinsic curiosity and influence-based rewards. The \textit{PIMAEX} reward, short for Peer-Incentivized Multi-Agent Exploration, aims to improve exploration in the multi-agent setting by encouraging agents to exert influence over each other to increase the likelihood of encountering novel states. We evaluate the \textit{PIMAEX} reward in conjunction with \textit{PIMAEX-Communication}, a multi-agent training algorithm that employs a communication channel for agents to influence one another. The evaluation is conducted in the \textit{Consume/Explore} environment, a partially observable environment with deceptive rewards, specifically designed to challenge the exploration vs.\ exploitation dilemma and the credit-assignment problem. The results empirically demonstrate that agents using the \textit{PIMAEX} reward with \textit{PIMAEX-Communication} outperform those that do not.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Luo, Junjie Liu, Sirong Wu, Yuhui Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Media bias in news articles arises from the political polarisation of media outlets, which can reinforce societal stereotypes and beliefs. Reporting on the same event often varies significantly between outlets, reflecting their political leanings through polarised language and focus. Although previous studies have attempted to generate bias-free summaries from multiperspective news articles, they have not effectively addressed the challenge of mitigating inherent media bias. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{NeutraSum}, a novel framework that integrates two neutrality losses to adjust the semantic space of generated summaries, thus minimising media bias. These losses, designed to balance the semantic distances across polarised inputs and ensure alignment with expert-written summaries, guide the generation of neutral and factually rich summaries. To evaluate media bias, we employ the political compass test, which maps political leanings based on economic and social dimensions. Experimental results on the Allsides dataset demonstrate that NeutraSum not only improves summarisation performance but also achieves significant reductions in media bias, offering a promising approach for neutral news summarisation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Lin, Yuxin Zhang, Zhe Chen, Zihan Fang, Cong Wu, Xianhao Chen, Yue Gao, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the increasing deployment of LEO satellite systems has enabled various space analytics (e.g., crop and climate monitoring), which heavily relies on the advancements in deep learning (DL). However, the intermittent connectivity between LEO satellites and ground station (GS) significantly hinders the timely transmission of raw data to GS for centralized learning, while the scaled-up DL models hamper distributed learning on resource-constrained LEO satellites. Though split learning (SL) can be a potential solution to these problems by partitioning a model and offloading primary training workload to GS, the labor-intensive labeling process remains an obstacle, with intermittent connectivity and data heterogeneity being other challenges. In this paper, we propose LEO-Split, a semi-supervised (SS) SL design tailored for satellite networks to combat these challenges. Leveraging SS learning to handle (labeled) data scarcity, we construct an auxiliary model to tackle the training failure of the satellite-GS non-contact time. Moreover, we propose a pseudo-labeling algorithm to rectify data imbalances across satellites. Lastly, an adaptive activation interpolation scheme is devised to prevent the overfitting of server-side sub-model training at GS. Extensive experiments with real-world LEO satellite traces (e.g., Starlink) demonstrate that our LEO-Split framework achieves superior performance compared to state-ofthe-art benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question answering systems are rapidly advancing, but their opaque nature may impact user trust. We explored trust through an anti-monitoring framework, where trust is predicted to be correlated with presence of citations and inversely related to checking citations. We tested this hypothesis with a live question-answering experiment that presented text responses generated using a commercial Chatbot along with varying citations (zero, one, or five), both relevant and random, and recorded if participants checked the citations and their self-reported trust in the generated responses. We found a significant increase in trust when citations were present, a result that held true even when the citations were random; we also found a significant decrease in trust when participants checked the citations. These results highlight the importance of citations in enhancing trust in AI-generated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Ge Zhang, Jingyi Cui, Qiran Li, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has shown significant performance improvements in recent years, often approaching or even rivaling supervised learning in various tasks. However, its learning mechanism is fundamentally different from that of supervised learning. Previous works have shown that difficult-to-learn examples (well-recognized in supervised learning as examples around the decision boundary), which are essential in supervised learning, contribute minimally in unsupervised settings. In this paper, perhaps surprisingly, we find that the direct removal of difficult-to-learn examples, although reduces the sample size, can boost the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. To uncover the reasons behind this, we develop a theoretical framework modeling the similarity between different pairs of samples. Guided by this theoretical framework, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis revealing that the presence of difficult-to-learn examples negatively affects the generalization of contrastive learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the removal of these examples, and techniques such as margin tuning and temperature scaling can enhance its generalization bounds, thereby improving performance. Empirically, we propose a simple and efficient mechanism for selecting difficult-to-learn examples and validate the effectiveness of the aforementioned methods, which substantiates the reliability of our proposed theoretical framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Test cases are essential for validating the reliability and quality of software applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate useful test cases for given source code. However, the existing work primarily relies on human-written plain prompts, which often leads to suboptimal results since the performance of LLMs can be highly influenced by the prompts. Moreover, these approaches use the same prompt for all LLMs, overlooking the fact that different LLMs might be best suited to different prompts. Given the wide variety of possible prompt formulations, automatically discovering the optimal prompt for each LLM presents a significant challenge. Although there are methods on automated prompt optimization in the natural language processing field, they are hard to produce effective prompts for the test case generation task. First, the methods iteratively optimize prompts by simply combining and mutating existing ones without proper guidance, resulting in prompts that lack diversity and tend to repeat the same errors in the generated test cases. Second, the prompts are generally lack of domain contextual knowledge, limiting LLMs' performance in the task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated methods for jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful content. Typically, these methods are evaluated using datasets of malicious prompts designed to bypass security policies established by LLM providers. However, the generally broad scope and open-ended nature of existing datasets can complicate the assessment of jailbreaking effectiveness, particularly in specific domains, notably cybersecurity. To address this issue, we present and publicly release CySecBench, a comprehensive dataset containing 12662 prompts specifically designed to evaluate jailbreaking techniques in the cybersecurity domain. The dataset is organized into 10 distinct attack-type categories, featuring close-ended prompts to enable a more consistent and accurate assessment of jailbreaking attempts. Furthermore, we detail our methodology for dataset generation and filtration, which can be adapted to create similar datasets in other domains. To demonstrate the utility of CySecBench, we propose and evaluate a jailbreaking approach based on prompt obfuscation. Our experimental results show that this method successfully elicits harmful content from commercial black-box LLMs, achieving Success Rates (SRs) of 65% with ChatGPT and 88% with Gemini; in contrast, Claude demonstrated greater resilience with a jailbreaking SR of 17%. Compared to existing benchmark approaches, our method shows superior performance, highlighting the value of domain-specific evaluation datasets for assessing LLM security measures. Moreover, when evaluated using prompts from a widely used dataset (i.e., AdvBench), it achieved an SR of 78.5%, higher than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Dennler, Stefanos Nikolaidis, Maja Matari\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: People have a variety of preferences for how robots behave. To understand and reason about these preferences, robots aim to learn a reward function that describes how aligned robot behaviors are with a user's preferences. Good representations of a robot's behavior can significantly reduce the time and effort required for a user to teach the robot their preferences. Specifying these representations -- what "features" of the robot's behavior matter to users -- remains a difficult problem; Features learned from raw data lack semantic meaning and features learned from user data require users to engage in tedious labeling processes. Our key insight is that users tasked with customizing a robot are intrinsically motivated to produce labels through exploratory search; they explore behaviors that they find interesting and ignore behaviors that are irrelevant. To harness this novel data source of exploratory actions, we propose contrastive learning from exploratory actions (CLEA) to learn trajectory features that are aligned with features that users care about. We learned CLEA features from exploratory actions users performed in an open-ended signal design activity (N=25) with a Kuri robot, and evaluated CLEA features through a second user study with a different set of users (N=42). CLEA features outperformed self-supervised features when eliciting user preferences over four metrics: completeness, simplicity, minimality, and explainability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) imaging is the gold standard for assessing myocardial fibrosis and scarring, with left ventricular (LV) LGE extent predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Despite its importance, routine LGE-based LV scar quantification is hindered by labor-intensive manual segmentation and inter-observer variability. Methods: We propose ScarNet, a hybrid model combining a transformer-based encoder from the Medical Segment Anything Model (MedSAM) with a convolution-based U-Net decoder, enhanced by tailored attention blocks. ScarNet was trained on 552 ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with expert segmentations of myocardial and scar boundaries and tested on 184 separate patients. Results: ScarNet achieved robust scar segmentation in 184 test patients, yielding a median Dice score of 0.912 (IQR: 0.863--0.944), significantly outperforming MedSAM (median Dice = 0.046, IQR: 0.043--0.047) and nnU-Net (median Dice = 0.638, IQR: 0.604--0.661). ScarNet demonstrated lower bias (-0.63%) and coefficient of variation (4.3%) compared to MedSAM (bias: -13.31%, CoV: 130.3%) and nnU-Net (bias: -2.46%, CoV: 20.3%). In Monte Carlo simulations with noise perturbations, ScarNet achieved significantly higher scar Dice (0.892 \pm 0.053, CoV = 5.9%) than MedSAM (0.048 \pm 0.112, CoV = 233.3%) and nnU-Net (0.615 \pm 0.537, CoV = 28.7%). Conclusion: ScarNet outperformed MedSAM and nnU-Net in accurately segmenting myocardial and scar boundaries in LGE images. The model exhibited robust performance across diverse image qualities and scar patterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs), which encapsulate extensive medical knowledge, demonstrate excellent capabilities in understanding medical images and responding to human queries based on these images. However, there remain challenges in visual localization in medical images, which is crucial for abnormality detection and interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a novel UMed-LVLM designed with Unveiling Medical abnormalities. Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Abnormal Localization Rewarding and Vision Relevance Rewarding. Experimental results demonstrate that our UMed-LVLM surpasses existing Med-LVLMs in identifying and understanding medical abnormality. In addition, this work shows that enhancing the abnormality detection capabilities of Med-LVLMs significantly improves their understanding of medical images and generalization capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjing Xu, Caesar Wu, Yuan-Fang Li, Gr\'egoire Danoy, Pascal Bouvry</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models for time series forecasting (TSF) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their effectiveness and versatility. However, these models often require extensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) to achieve the best possible performance, and a unified pipeline for HPO in transformer-based TSF remains lacking. In this paper, we present one such pipeline and conduct extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer-based TSF models. These experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets to evaluate and compare the performance of different models, generating practical insights and examples. Our pipeline is generalizable beyond transformer-based architectures and can be applied to other SOTA models, such as Mamba and TimeMixer, as demonstrated in our experiments. The goal of this work is to provide valuable guidance to both industry practitioners and academic researchers in efficiently identifying optimal hyperparameters suited to their specific domain applications. The code and complete experimental results are available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Jae Shin Yoon, Hyeonho Jeong, Niloy Mitra, Duygu Ceylan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the emergent 3D capabilities in image generators, we explore whether video generators similarly exhibit 3D awareness. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) as a benchmark for 3D tasks, we investigate if intermediate features from OpenSora, a video generation model, can support camera pose estimation. We first examine native 3D awareness in video generation features by routing raw intermediate outputs to SfM-prediction modules like DUSt3R. Then, we explore the impact of fine-tuning on camera pose estimation to enhance 3D awareness. Results indicate that while video generator features have limited inherent 3D awareness, task-specific supervision significantly boosts their accuracy for camera pose estimation, resulting in competitive performance. The proposed unified model, named JOG3R, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality without degrading video generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixu Liu, Wenning Wang, Haoxiang Zheng, Penghao Jiang, Qirui Wang, Ruiqing Yan, Qiuzhuang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: This work aims to predict the popularity of short videos using the videos themselves and their related features. Popularity is measured by four key engagement metrics: view count, like count, comment count, and share count. This study employs video classification models with different architectures and training methods as backbone networks to extract video modality features. Meanwhile, the cleaned video captions are incorporated into a carefully designed prompt framework, along with the video, as input for video-to-text generation models, which generate detailed text-based video content understanding. These texts are then encoded into vectors using a pre-trained BERT model. Based on the six sets of vectors mentioned above, a neural network is trained for each of the four prediction metrics. Moreover, the study conducts data mining and feature engineering based on the video and tabular data, constructing practical features such as the total frequency of hashtag appearances, the total frequency of mention appearances, video duration, frame count, frame rate, and total time online. Multiple machine learning models are trained, and the most stable model, XGBoost, is selected. Finally, the predictions from the neural network and XGBoost models are averaged to obtain the final result.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Parmar, Or Patashnik, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Daniil Ostashev, Srinivasa Narasimhan, Jun-Yan Zhu, Daniel Cohen-Or, Kfir Aberman</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a method for composing object-level visual prompts within a text-to-image diffusion model. Our approach addresses the task of generating semantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to the versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in this task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input visual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention mechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual representations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck for layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder that captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from these complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual prompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and composition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional guidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness. Results show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that preserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the creative potential of text-to-image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Mei, Ming Li, Yuanzeng Cheng, Limin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper managed to induce probability theory (sigma system) and possibility theory (max system) respectively from the clearly-defined randomness and fuzziness, while focusing the question why the key axiom of "maxitivity" is adopted for possibility measure. Such an objective is achieved by following three steps: a) the establishment of mathematical definitions of randomness and fuzziness; b) the development of intuitive definition of possibility as measure of fuzziness based on compatibility interpretation; c) the abstraction of the axiomatic definitions of probability/ possibility from their intuitive definitions, by taking advantage of properties of the well-defined randomness and fuzziness. We derived the conclusion that "max" is the only but un-strict disjunctive operator that is applicable across the fuzzy event space, and is an exact operator for extracting the value from the fuzzy sample space that leads to the largest possibility of one. Then a demonstration example of stock price prediction is presented, which confirms that max inference indeed exhibits distinctive performance, with an improvement up to 18.99%, over sigma inference for the investigated application. Our work provides a physical foundation for the axiomatic definition of possibility for the measure of fuzziness, which hopefully would facilitate wider adoption of possibility theory in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengbang Zhu, Minghuan Liu, Liyuan Mao, Bingyi Kang, Minkai Xu, Yong Yu, Stefano Ermon, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from pre-existing datasets without further interactions, making it a challenging task. Q-learning algorithms struggle with extrapolation errors in offline settings, while supervised learning methods are constrained by model expressiveness. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations in single-agent learning, but their application in multi-agent scenarios remains unclear. Generating trajectories for each agent with independent DMs may impede coordination, while concatenating all agents' information can lead to low sample efficiency. Accordingly, we propose MADiff, which is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, functioning as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that MADiff outperforms baseline algorithms across various multi-agent learning tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex multi-agent interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlong Zheng, Xiaozhou Zhang, Donghao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address a method that integrates reinforcement learning into the Monte Carlo tree search to boost online path planning under fully observable environments for automated parking tasks. Sampling-based planning methods under high-dimensional space can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. State evaluation methods are useful by leveraging the prior knowledge into the search steps, making the process faster in a real-time system. Given the fact that automated parking tasks are often executed under complex environments, a solid but lightweight heuristic guidance is challenging to compose in a traditional analytical way. To overcome this limitation, we propose a reinforcement learning pipeline with a Monte Carlo tree search under the path planning framework. By iteratively learning the value of a state and the best action among samples from its previous cycle's outcomes, we are able to model a value estimator and a policy generator for given states. By doing that, we build up a balancing mechanism between exploration and exploitation, speeding up the path planning process while maintaining its quality without using human expert driver data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The pursuit of artificial consciousness requires conceptual clarity to navigate its theoretical and empirical challenges. This paper introduces a composite, multilevel, and multidimensional model of consciousness as a heuristic framework to guide research in this field. Consciousness is treated as a complex phenomenon, with distinct constituents and dimensions that can be operationalized for study and for evaluating their replication. We argue that this model provides a balanced approach to artificial consciousness research by avoiding binary thinking (e.g., conscious vs. non-conscious) and offering a structured basis for testable hypotheses. To illustrate its utility, we focus on "awareness" as a case study, demonstrating how specific dimensions of consciousness can be pragmatically analyzed and targeted for potential artificial instantiation. By breaking down the conceptual intricacies of consciousness and aligning them with practical research goals, this paper lays the groundwork for a robust strategy to advance the scientific and technical understanding of artificial consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Xuan, Yazhe Niu, Yuan Pu, Shuai Hu, Yu Liu, Jing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithms, such as MuZero and its derivatives, have achieved widespread success in various decision-making domains. These algorithms employ the reanalyze process to enhance sample efficiency from stale data, albeit at the expense of significant wall-clock time consumption. To address this issue, we propose a general approach named ReZero to boost tree search operations for MCTS-based algorithms. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the one-armed bandit model, we reanalyze training samples through a backward-view reuse technique which uses the value estimation of a certain child node to save the corresponding sub-tree search time. To further adapt to this design, we periodically reanalyze the entire buffer instead of frequently reanalyzing the mini-batch. The synergy of these two designs can significantly reduce the search cost and meanwhile guarantee or even improve performance, simplifying both data collecting and reanalyzing. Experiments conducted on Atari environments, DMControl suites and board games demonstrate that ReZero substantially improves training speed while maintaining high sample efficiency. The code is available as part of the LightZero MCTS benchmark at https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongming Zhang, Xiaoman Pan, Hongwei Wang, Kaixin Ma, Wenhao Yu, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Cognitive Kernel, an open-source agent system towards the goal of generalist autopilots. Unlike copilot systems, which primarily rely on users to provide essential state information (e.g., task descriptions) and assist users by answering questions or auto-completing contents, autopilot systems must complete tasks from start to finish independently, which requires the system to acquire the state information from the environments actively. To achieve this, an autopilot system should be capable of understanding user intents, actively gathering necessary information from various real-world sources, and making wise decisions. Cognitive Kernel adopts a model-centric design. In our implementation, the central policy model (a fine-tuned LLM) initiates interactions with the environment using a combination of atomic actions, such as opening files, clicking buttons, saving intermediate results to memory, or calling the LLM itself. This differs from the widely used environment-centric design, where a task-specific environment with predefined actions is fixed, and the policy model is limited to selecting the correct action from a given set of options. Our design facilitates seamless information flow across various sources and provides greater flexibility. We evaluate our system in three use cases: real-time information management, private information management, and long-term memory management. The results demonstrate that Cognitive Kernel achieves better or comparable performance to other closed-source systems in these scenarios. Cognitive Kernel is fully dockerized, ensuring everyone can deploy it privately and securely. We open-source the system and the backbone model to encourage further research on LLM-driven autopilot systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binxia Xu, Antonis Bikakis, Daniel Onah, Andreas Vlachidis, Luke Dickens</p>
<p>Abstract: Given that AI systems are set to play a pivotal role in future decision-making processes, their trustworthiness and reliability are of critical concern. Due to their scale and complexity, modern AI systems resist direct interpretation, and alternative ways are needed to establish trust in those systems, and determine how well they align with human values. We argue that good measures of the information processing similarities between AI and humans, may be able to achieve these same ends. While Representational alignment (RA) approaches measure similarity between the internal states of two systems, the associated data can be expensive and difficult to collect for human systems. In contrast, Behavioural alignment (BA) comparisons are cheaper and easier, but questions remain as to their sensitivity and reliability. We propose two new behavioural alignment metrics misclassification agreement which measures the similarity between the errors of two systems on the same instances, and class-level error similarity which measures the similarity between the error distributions of two systems. We show that our metrics correlate well with RA metrics, and provide complementary information to another BA metric, within a range of domains, and set the scene for a new approach to value alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Jing</p>
<p>Abstract: With the process of urbanization and the rapid growth of population, the issue of traffic congestion has become an increasingly critical concern. Intelligent transportation systems heavily rely on real-time and precise prediction algorithms to address this problem. While Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in deep learning have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting road conditions when sufficient data is available, forecasting in road networks with limited data remains a challenging task. This study proposed a novel Spatial-temporal Convolutional Network (TL-GPSTGN) based on graph pruning and transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Firstly, the essential structure and information of the graph are extracted by analyzing the correlation and information entropy of the road network structure and feature data. By utilizing graph pruning techniques, the adjacency matrix of the graph and the input feature data are processed, resulting in a significant improvement in the model's migration performance. Subsequently, the well-characterized data are inputted into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to capture the spatial-temporal relationships and make predictions regarding the road conditions. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive testing and validation of the TL-GPSTGN method on real datasets, comparing its prediction performance against other commonly used models under identical conditions. The results demonstrate the exceptional predictive accuracy of TL-GPSTGN on a single dataset, as well as its robust migration performance across different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Firooz, Maziar Sanjabi, Wenlong Jiang, Xiaoling Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit blind spots that impair their ability to retrieve and process relevant contextual data effectively. We demonstrate that LLM performance in graph tasks with complexities beyond the "needle-in-a-haystack" scenario-where solving the problem requires cross-referencing and reasoning across multiple subproblems jointly-is influenced by the proximity of relevant information within the context, a phenomenon we term "lost-in-distance". We examine two fundamental graph tasks: identifying common connections between two nodes and assessing similarity among three nodes, and show that the model's performance in these tasks significantly depends on the relative positioning of common edges. We evaluate three publicly available LLMs using various graph encoding techniques that represent graph structures for LLM input. We propose a formulation for the lost-in-distance phenomenon and demonstrate that lost-in-distance and lost-in-the middle phenomenas occur independently. Results indicate that model accuracy can decline by up to 6x as the distance between node connections increases, independent of graph encoding and model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saad Attieh, Nguyen Dang, Christopher Jefferson, Ian Miguel, Peter Nightingale</p>
<p>Abstract: Local search is a common method for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. We focus on general-purpose local search solvers that accept as input a constraint model - a declarative description of a problem consisting of a set of decision variables under a set of constraints. Existing approaches typically take as input models written in solver-independent constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc. The Athanor solver we describe herein differs in that it begins from a specification of a problem in the abstract constraint specification language Essence, which allows problems to be described without commitment to low-level modelling decisions through its support for a rich set of abstract types. The advantage of proceeding from Essence is that the structure apparent in a concise, abstract specification of a problem can be exploited to generate high quality neighbourhoods automatically, avoiding the difficult task of identifying that structure in an equivalent constraint model. Based on the twin benefits of neighbourhoods derived from high level types and the scalability derived by searching directly over those types, our empirical results demonstrate strong performance in practice relative to existing solution methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Arakelyan, Pasquale Minervini, Pat Verga, Patrick Lewis, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of ChatGPT has sparked a renewed wave of interest in artificial intelligence (AI), and the advancements in visual language models (VLMs) have pushed this enthusiasm to new heights. Differring from previous AI approaches that generally formulated different tasks as discriminative models, VLMs frame tasks as generative models and align language with visual information, enabling the handling of more challenging problems. The remote sensing (RS) field, a highly practical domain, has also embraced this new trend and introduced several VLM-based RS methods that have demonstrated promising performance and enormous potential. In this paper, we first review the fundamental theories related to VLM, then summarize the datasets constructed for VLMs in remote sensing and the various tasks they addressed. Finally, we categorize the improvement methods into three main parts according to the core components of VLMs and provide a detailed introduction and comparison of these methods.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a systematic effort to design, evaluate, and implement a realistic conversational recommender system (CRS). The objective of our system is to allow users to input free-form text to request recommendations, and then receive a list of relevant and diverse items. While previous work on synthetic queries augments large language models (LLMs) with 1-3 tools, we argue that a more extensive toolbox is necessary to effectively handle real user requests. As such, we propose a novel approach that equips LLMs with over 10 tools, providing them access to the internal knowledge base and API calls used in production. We evaluate our model on a dataset of real users and show that it generates relevant, novel, and diverse recommendations compared to vanilla LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the full range of tools in our toolbox. We share our designs and lessons learned from deploying the system for internal alpha release. Our contribution is the addressing of all four key aspects of a practicable CRS: (1) real user requests, (2) augmenting LLMs with a wide variety of tools, (3) extensive evaluation, and (4) deployment insights.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be highly effective in boosting the generative performance of language model in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG framework either indiscriminately perform retrieval or rely on rigid single-class classifiers to select retrieval methods, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance across queries of varying complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy based on query complexity. % our solution Our approach leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm, which treats each retrieval method as a distinct ``arm'' and adapts the selection process by balancing exploration and exploitation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic reward function that balances accuracy and efficiency, penalizing methods that require more retrieval steps, even if they lead to a correct result. Our method achieves new state of the art results on multiple single-hop and multi-hop datasets while reducing retrieval costs. Our code are available at https://github.com/FUTUREEEEEE/MBA .</p>

<p>Abstract: To accurately and confidently answer the question 'could an AI model or system increase biorisk', it is necessary to have both a sound theoretical threat model for how AI models or systems could increase biorisk and a robust method for testing that threat model. This paper provides an analysis of existing available research surrounding two AI and biorisk threat models: 1) access to information and planning via large language models (LLMs), and 2) the use of AI-enabled biological tools (BTs) in synthesizing novel biological artifacts. We find that existing studies around AI-related biorisk are nascent, often speculative in nature, or limited in terms of their methodological maturity and transparency. The available literature suggests that current LLMs and BTs do not pose an immediate risk, and more work is needed to develop rigorous approaches to understanding how future models could increase biorisks. We end with recommendations about how empirical work can be expanded to more precisely target biorisk and ensure rigor and validity of findings.</p>

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsu, Cyrus DiCiccio, Natesh Sivasubramoniapillai, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness research in machine learning often centers on ensuring equitable performance of individual models. However, real-world recommendation systems are built on multiple models and even multiple stages, from candidate retrieval to scoring and serving, which raises challenges for responsible development and deployment. This system-level view, as highlighted by regulations like the EU AI Act, necessitates moving beyond auditing individual models as independent entities. We propose a holistic framework for modeling system-level fairness, focusing on the end-utility delivered to diverse user groups, and consider interactions between components such as retrieval and scoring models. We provide formal insights on the limitations of focusing solely on model-level fairness and highlight the need for alternative tools that account for heterogeneity in user preferences. To mitigate system-level disparities, we adapt closed-box optimization tools (e.g., BayesOpt) to jointly optimize utility and equity. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic and real datasets, underscoring the need for a system-level framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence-based language generators are now a part of most people's lives. However, by default, they tend to generate "average" language without reflecting the ways in which people differ. Here, we propose a lightweight modification to the standard language model transformer architecture - "PsychAdapter" - that uses empirically derived trait-language patterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic, and mental health characteristics (with or without prompting). We applied PsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and found generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters evaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended trait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7% for depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to introduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the foundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer layer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles, clinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological conditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or education level without taking up LLM context windows. PsychAdapter also allows for the exploration psychological constructs through natural language expression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human psychology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ermo Hua, Che Jiang, Xingtai Lv, Kaiyan Zhang, Ning Ding, Youbang Sun, Biqing Qi, Yuchen Fan, Xuekai Zhu, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales show that, within varying context windows, FoPE can maintain a more stable perplexity and a more consistent accuracy in a needle-in-haystack task compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines whether collective reasoning among generative agents can facilitate novel and coherent thinking that leads to innovation. To achieve this, it proposes GAI, a new LLM-empowered framework designed for reflection and interaction among multiple generative agents to replicate the process of innovation. The core of the GAI framework lies in an architecture that dynamically processes the internal states of agents and a dialogue scheme specifically tailored to facilitate analogy-driven innovation. The framework's functionality is evaluated using Dyson's invention of the bladeless fan as a case study, assessing the extent to which the core ideas of the innovation can be replicated through a set of fictional technical documents. The experimental results demonstrate that models with internal states significantly outperformed those without, achieving higher average scores and lower variance. Notably, the model with five heterogeneous agents equipped with internal states successfully replicated the key ideas underlying the Dyson's invention. This indicates that the internal state enables agents to refine their ideas, resulting in the construction and sharing of more coherent and comprehensive concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Li, Yiming Li, Anxin Tian, Tianhao Tang, Zhanchao Xu, Xuejia Chen, Nicole Hu, Wei Dong, Qing Li, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: We introduce HunyuanProver, an language model finetuned from the Hunyuan 7B for interactive automatic theorem proving with LEAN4. To alleviate the data sparsity issue, we design a scalable framework to iterative synthesize data with low cost. Besides, guided tree search algorithms are designed to enable effective ``system 2 thinking`` of the prover. HunyuanProver achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on major benchmarks. Specifically, it achieves a pass of 68.4% on the miniF2F-test compared to 65.9%, the current SOTA results. It proves 4 IMO statements (imo_1960_p2, imo_1962_p2}, imo_1964_p2 and imo_1983_p6) in miniF2F-test. To benefit the community, we will open-source a dataset of 30k synthesized instances, where each instance contains the original question in natural language, the converted statement by autoformalization, and the proof by HunyuanProver.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lior Siag, Shahaf S. Shperberg, Ariel Felner, Nathan R. Sturtevant</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallelization and External Memory (PEM) techniques have significantly enhanced the capabilities of search algorithms when solving large-scale problems. Previous research on PEM has primarily centered on unidirectional algorithms, with only one publication on bidirectional PEM that focuses on the meet-in-the-middle (MM) algorithm. Building upon this foundation, this paper presents a framework that integrates both uni- and bi-directional best-first search algorithms into this framework. We then develop a PEM variant of the state-of-the-art bidirectional heuristic search (BiHS) algorithm BAE* (PEM-BAE*). As previous work on BiHS did not focus on scaling problem sizes, this work enables us to evaluate bidirectional algorithms on hard problems. Empirical evaluation shows that PEM-BAE* outperforms the PEM variants of A* and the MM algorithm, as well as a parallel variant of IDA*. These findings mark a significant milestone, revealing that bidirectional search algorithms clearly outperform unidirectional search algorithms across several domains, even when equipped with state-of-the-art heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Xue, Yutong Wang, Cong Guan, Lei Yuan, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Chao Qian, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating agents that can achieve zero-shot coordination (ZSC) with unseen partners is a new challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may be inefficient. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on various heterogeneous tasks highlight the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous ZSC tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00314">Causal Deep Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Alex O. Vasilescu</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates forward and inverse causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of the operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in a doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16900">InceptionNeXt: When Inception Meets ConvNeXt</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Yu, Pan Zhou, Shuicheng Yan, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the long-range modeling ability of ViTs, large-kernel convolutions are widely studied and adopted recently to enlarge the receptive field and improve model performance, like the remarkable work ConvNeXt which employs 7x7 depthwise convolution. Although such depthwise operator only consumes a few FLOPs, it largely harms the model efficiency on powerful computing devices due to the high memory access costs. For example, ConvNeXt-T has similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves ~60% throughputs when trained on A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt can improve speed, it results in significant performance degradation, which poses a challenging problem: How to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving their performance. To tackle this issue, inspired by Inceptions, we propose to decompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along channel dimension, i.e., small square kernel, two orthogonal band kernels, and an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution, we build a series of networks, namely IncepitonNeXt, which not only enjoy high throughputs but also maintain competitive performance. For instance, InceptionNeXt-T achieves 1.6x higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T, as well as attains 0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K. We anticipate InceptionNeXt can serve as an economical baseline for future architecture design to reduce carbon footprint. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/inceptionnext.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruosen Li, Teerth Patel, Xinya Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, the quality of responses generated by different modern large language models (LLMs) is hard to evaluate and compare automatically. Recent studies suggest and predominantly use LLMs for reference-free evaluation of open-ended question answering. More specifically, they use the recognized "strongest" LLM as the evaluator, which conducts pairwise comparisons of candidate models' answers and provides a ranking score. However, this intuitive method has multiple problems, such as bringing in self-enhancement (favoring its own answers) and positional bias. We draw insights and lessons from the educational domain (Cho & MacArthur, 2011; Walsh, 2014) to improve LLM-based evaluations. Specifically, we propose (1) the peer rank (PR) algorithm that takes into account each peer LLM's pairwise preferences of all answer pairs, and outputs a final ranking of models; and (2) peer discussion (PD), where we prompt two LLMs to discuss and try to reach a mutual agreement on the preferences of two answers. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets. We find that our approaches achieve higher accuracy and align better with human judgments. Interestingly, PR can induce a relatively accurate self-ranking of models under the anonymous setting, where each model's name is unrevealed. Our work provides space to explore evaluating models that are hard to compare for humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Laufer, Jon Kleinberg, Hoda Heidari</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) follow a familiar structure: A firm releases a large, pretrained model. It is designed to be adapted and tweaked by other entities to perform particular, domain-specific functions. The model is described as `general-purpose,' meaning it can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks, in a process known as adaptation or fine-tuning. Understanding this process - the strategies, incentives, and interactions involved in the development of AI tools - is crucial for making conclusions about societal implications and regulatory responses, and may provide insights beyond AI about general-purpose technologies. We propose a model of this adaptation process. A Generalist brings the technology to a certain level of performance, and one or more Domain specialist(s) adapt it for use in particular domain(s). Players incur costs when they invest in the technology, so they need to reach a bargaining agreement on how to share the resulting revenue before making their investment decisions. We find that for a broad class of cost and revenue functions, there exists a set of Pareto-optimal profit-sharing arrangements where the players jointly contribute to the technology. Our analysis, which utilizes methods based on bargaining solutions and sub-game perfect equilibria, provides insights into the strategic behaviors of firms in these types of interactions. For example, profit-sharing can arise even when one firm faces significantly higher costs than another. After demonstrating findings in the case of one domain-specialist, we provide closed-form and numerical bargaining solutions in the generalized setting with $n$ domain specialists. We find that any potential domain specialization will either contribute, free-ride, or abstain in their uptake of the technology, and provide conditions yielding these different responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration highlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in achieving exceptional math performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehonatan Avidan, Qianyi Li, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Li, Mingfeng Shang, Shian Wang, Raphael Stern</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems, such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) and other automated driving features, the potential for cyberattacks on these automated vehicles (AVs) has emerged. While overt attacks that force vehicles to collide may be easily identified, more insidious attacks, which only slightly alter driving behavior, can result in network-wide increases in congestion, fuel consumption, and even crash risk without being easily detected. To address the detection of such attacks, we first present a traffic model framework for three types of potential cyberattacks: malicious manipulation of vehicle control commands, false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We then investigate the impacts of these attacks at both the individual vehicle (micro) and traffic flow (macro) levels. A novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based anomaly detection model is proposed for real-time identification of such attacks using vehicle trajectory data. We provide numerical evidence {to demonstrate} the efficacy of our machine learning approach in detecting cyberattacks on ACC-equipped vehicles. The proposed method is compared against some recently proposed neural network models and observed to have higher accuracy in identifying anomalous driving behaviors of ACC vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Junayed Hasan, Suhra Noor, Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical texts, such as admission notes, discharge summaries, and progress notes, contain rich and valuable information that can be used for clinical decision making. However, a severe bottleneck in using transformer encoders for processing clinical texts comes from the input length limit of these models: transformer-based encoders use fixed-length inputs. Therefore, these models discard part of the inputs while processing medical text. There is a risk of losing vital knowledge from clinical text if only part of it is processed. This paper proposes a novel method to preserve the knowledge of long clinical texts in the models using aggregated ensembles of transformer encoders. Previous studies used either ensemble or aggregation, but we studied the effects of fusing these methods. We trained several pre-trained BERT-like transformer encoders on two clinical outcome tasks: mortality prediction and length of stay prediction. Our method achieved better results than all baseline models for prediction tasks on long clinical notes. We conducted extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III clinical database's admission notes by combining multiple unstructured and high-dimensional datasets, demonstrating our method's effectiveness and superiority over existing approaches. This study shows that fusing ensemble and aggregation improves the model performance for clinical prediction tasks, particularly the mortality and the length of hospital stay.</p>

Simultaneously a promising new approach to Reinforcement Learning arises using the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, reducing the trainable parameters of a model significantly. However, gradient-based Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning methods often have to struggle with barren plateaus, holding them back from matching the performance of classical approaches. While gradient free Quantum Reinforcement Learning methods may alleviate some of these challenges, they too are not immune to the difficulties posed by barren plateaus. We build upon an existing approach for gradient free Quantum Reinforcement Learning and propose three genetic variations with Variational Quantum Circuits for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our genetic variations in the Coin Game environment and also compare them to classical approaches. We showed that our Variational Quantum Circuit approaches perform significantly better compared to a neural network with a similar amount of trainable parameters. Compared to the larger neural network, our approaches archive similar results using $97.88\%$ less parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sammy Christen, Lan Feng, Wei Yang, Yu-Wei Chao, Otmar Hilliges, Jie Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-based human-to-robot handover is an important and challenging task in human-robot interaction. Recent work has attempted to train robot policies by interacting with dynamic virtual humans in simulated environments, where the policies can later be transferred to the real world. However, a major bottleneck is the reliance on human motion capture data, which is expensive to acquire and difficult to scale to arbitrary objects and human grasping motions. In this paper, we introduce a framework that can generate plausible human grasping motions suitable for training the robot. To achieve this, we propose a hand-object synthesis method that is designed to generate handover-friendly motions similar to humans. This allows us to generate synthetic training and testing data with 100x more objects than previous work. In our experiments, we show that our method trained purely with synthetic data is competitive with state-of-the-art methods that rely on real human motion data both in simulation and on a real system. In addition, we can perform evaluations on a larger scale compared to prior work. With our newly introduced test set, we show that our model can better scale to a large variety of unseen objects and human motions compared to the baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vatsal Gupta, Pranshu Pandya, Tushar Kataria, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models, characterized by their black-box nature, often hallucinate and display sensitivity to input perturbations, causing concerns about trust. To enhance trust, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's failure modes and develop effective strategies to improve their performance. In this study, we introduce a methodology designed to examine how input perturbations affect language models across various scales, including pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Utilizing fine-tuning, we enhance the model's robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, we investigate whether exposure to one perturbation enhances or diminishes the model's performance with respect to other perturbations. To address robustness against multiple perturbations, we present three distinct fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of our methodology to encompass large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach augmented with exemplars. We employ the Tabular-NLI task to showcase how our proposed strategies adeptly train a robust model, enabling it to address diverse perturbations while maintaining accuracy on the original dataset. https://msin-infotabs.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Furuta, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Izzeddin Gur</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model agents (LMA) recently emerged as a promising paradigm on muti-step decision making tasks, often outperforming humans and other reinforcement learning agents. Despite the promise, their performance on real-world applications that often involve combinations of tasks is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, called CompWoB -- 50 new compositional web automation tasks reflecting more realistic assumptions. We show that while existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) achieve 94.0% average success rate on base tasks, their performance degrades to 24.9% success rate on compositional tasks. On the other hand, transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks) show less generalization gap, dropping from 85.4% to 54.8%. By balancing data distribution across tasks, we train a new model, HTML-T5++, that surpasses human-level performance (95.2%) on MiniWoB, and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB (61.5%). While these highlight the promise of small-scale finetuned and transferred models for task compositionality, their performance further degrades under different instruction compositions changing combinational order. In contrast to the recent remarkable success of LMA, our benchmark and detailed analysis emphasize the necessity of building LMAs that are robust and generalizable to task compositionality for real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Xu, Yi Qin, Lu Mi, Hao Wang, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods, such as concept bottleneck models (CBMs), have been successful in providing concept-based interpretations for black-box deep learning models. They typically work by predicting concepts given the input and then predicting the final class label given the predicted concepts. However, (1) they often fail to capture the high-order, nonlinear interaction between concepts, e.g., correcting a predicted concept (e.g., "yellow breast") does not help correct highly correlated concepts (e.g., "yellow belly"), leading to suboptimal final accuracy; (2) they cannot naturally quantify the complex conditional dependencies between different concepts and class labels (e.g., for an image with the class label "Kentucky Warbler" and a concept "black bill", what is the probability that the model correctly predicts another concept "black crown"), therefore failing to provide deeper insight into how a black-box model works. In response to these limitations, we propose Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Our ECBMs use a set of neural networks to define the joint energy of candidate (input, concept, class) tuples. With such a unified interface, prediction, concept correction, and conditional dependency quantification are then represented as conditional probabilities, which are generated by composing different energy functions. Our ECBMs address both limitations of existing CBMs, providing higher accuracy and richer concept interpretations. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Goodfriend</p>
<p>Abstract: Scripted agents have predominantly won the five previous iterations of the IEEE microRTS ($\mu$RTS) competitions hosted at CIG and CoG. Despite Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms making significant strides in real-time strategy (RTS) games, their adoption in this primarily academic competition has been limited due to the considerable training resources required and the complexity inherent in creating and debugging such agents. RAISocketAI is the first DRL agent to win the IEEE microRTS competition. In a benchmark without performance constraints, RAISocketAI regularly defeated the two prior competition winners. This first competition-winning DRL submission can be a benchmark for future microRTS competitions and a starting point for future DRL research. Iteratively fine-tuning the base policy and transfer learning to specific maps were critical to RAISocketAI's winning performance. These strategies can be used to economically train future DRL agents. Further work in Imitation Learning using Behavior Cloning and fine-tuning these models with DRL has proven promising as an efficient way to bootstrap models with demonstrated, competitive behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Wang, Yihao Feng, Tian Lan, Ning Yu, Yu Bai, Ran Xu, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language serves as a common and straightforward signal for humans to interact seamlessly with machines. Recognizing the importance of this interface, the machine learning community is investing considerable effort in generating data that is semantically coherent with textual instructions. While strides have been made in text-to-data generation spanning image editing, audio synthesis, video creation, and beyond, low-resource areas characterized by expensive annotations or complex data structures, such as molecules, motion dynamics, and time series, often lack textual labels. This deficiency impedes supervised learning, thereby constraining the application of advanced generative models for text-to-data tasks. In response to these challenges in the low-resource scenario, we propose Text2Data, a novel approach that utilizes unlabeled data to understand the underlying data distribution through an unsupervised diffusion model. Subsequently, it undergoes controllable finetuning via a novel constraint optimization-based learning objective that ensures controllability and effectively counteracts catastrophic forgetting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Text2Data is able to achieve enhanced performance regarding controllability across various modalities, including molecules, motions and time series, when compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhang, Jian Yang, Jiaheng Liu, Zhoujun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Logs produced by extensive software systems are integral to monitoring system behaviors. Advanced log analysis facilitates the detection, alerting, and diagnosis of system faults. Log parsing, which entails transforming raw log messages into structured templates, constitutes a critical phase in the automation of log analytics. Existing log parsers fail to identify the correct templates due to reliance on human-made rules. Besides, These methods focus on statistical features while ignoring semantic information in log messages. To address these challenges, we introduce a cutting-edge \textbf{L}og parsing framework with \textbf{E}ntropy sampling and Chain-of-Thought \textbf{M}erging (Lemur). Specifically, to discard the tedious manual rules. We propose a novel sampling method inspired by information entropy, which efficiently clusters typical logs. Furthermore, to enhance the merging of log templates, we design a chain-of-thought method for large language models (LLMs). LLMs exhibit exceptional semantic comprehension, deftly distinguishing between parameters and invariant tokens. We have conducted experiments on large-scale public datasets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Lemur achieves the state-of-the-art performance and impressive efficiency. The Code is available at https://github.com/zwpride/lemur.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangamesh Kodge, Deepak Ravikumar, Gobinda Saha, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Label corruption, where training samples are mislabeled due to non-expert annotation or adversarial attacks, significantly degrades model performance. Acquiring large, perfectly labeled datasets is costly, and retraining models from scratch is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Scaled Activation Projection (SAP), a novel SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)-based corrective machine unlearning algorithm. SAP mitigates label noise by identifying a small subset of trusted samples using cross-entropy loss and projecting model weights onto a clean activation space estimated using SVD on these trusted samples. This process suppresses the noise introduced in activations due to the mislabeled samples. In our experiments, we demonstrate SAP's effectiveness on synthetic noise with different settings and real-world label noise. SAP applied to the CIFAR dataset with 25% synthetic corruption show upto 6% generalization improvements. Additionally, SAP can improve the generalization over noise robust training approaches on CIFAR dataset by ~3.2% on average. Further, we observe generalization improvements of 2.31% for a Vision Transformer model trained on naturally corrupted Clothing1M.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsuan-Cheng Liao, Chih-Hong Cheng, Hasan Esen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Ego-Centric Intersection-over-Union (EC-IoU), addressing the limitation of the standard IoU measure in characterizing safety-related performance for object detectors in navigating contexts. Concretely, we propose a weighting mechanism to refine IoU, allowing it to assign a higher score to a prediction that covers closer points of a ground-truth object from the ego agent's perspective. The proposed EC-IoU measure can be used in typical evaluation processes to select object detectors with better safety-related performance for downstream tasks. It can also be integrated into common loss functions for model fine-tuning. While geared towards safety, our experiment with the KITTI dataset demonstrates the performance of a model trained on EC-IoU can be better than that of a variant trained on IoU in terms of mean Average Precision as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josiah Bjorgaard</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal data fusion is essential for applications requiring the integration of diverse data sources, especially in the presence of incomplete or sparsely available modalities. This paper presents a comparative study of three multimodal embedding techniques, Modal Channel Attention (MCA), Zorro, and Everything at Once (EAO), to evaluate their performance on sparsely multimodal data. MCA introduces fusion embeddings for all combinations of input modalities and uses attention masking to create distinct attention channels, enabling flexible and efficient data fusion. Experiments on two datasets with four modalities each, CMU-MOSEI and TCGA, demonstrate that MCA outperforms Zorro across ranking, recall, regression, and classification tasks and outperforms EAO across regression and classification tasks. MCA achieves superior performance by maintaining robust uniformity across unimodal and fusion embeddings. While EAO performs best in ranking metrics due to its approach of forming fusion embeddings post-inference, it underperforms in downstream tasks requiring multimodal interactions. These results highlight the importance of contrasting all modality combinations in constructing embedding spaces and offers insights into the design of multimodal architectures for real-world applications with incomplete data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Shi, Rujie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data generation. In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daphne Theodorakopoulos, Frederic Stahl, Marius Lindauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization plays a pivotal role in enhancing the predictive performance and generalization capabilities of ML models. However, in many applications, we do not only care about predictive performance but also about additional objectives such as inference time, memory, or energy consumption. In such multi-objective scenarios, determining the importance of hyperparameters poses a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between the conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose the first method for assessing the importance of hyperparameters in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization. Our approach leverages surrogate-based hyperparameter importance measures, i.e., fANOVA and ablation paths, to provide insights into the impact of hyperparameters on the optimization objectives. Specifically, we compute the a-priori scalarization of the objectives and determine the importance of the hyperparameters for different objective tradeoffs. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets with three different objective pairs, each combined with accuracy, namely time, demographic parity loss, and energy consumption, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. Our findings not only offer valuable guidance for hyperparameter tuning in multi-objective optimization tasks but also contribute to advancing the understanding of hyperparameter importance in complex optimization scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14861">Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yuling Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Munief Hassan Tahir, Sana Shams, Layba Fiaz, Farah Adeeba, Sarmad Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on multilingual data have revolutionized natural language processing research, by transitioning from languages and task specific model pipelines to a single model adapted on a variety of tasks. However majority of existing multilingual NLP benchmarks for LLMs provide evaluation data in only few languages with little linguistic diversity. In addition these benchmarks lack quality assessment against the respective state-of the art models. This study presents an in-depth examination of 7 prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama 2-7B-Chat, Llama 3.1-8B, Bloomz 3B, Bloomz 7B1, Ministral-8B and Whisper (Large, medium and small variant) across 17 tasks using 22 datasets, 13.8 hours of speech, in a zero-shot setting, and their performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, has been compared and analyzed. Our experiments show that SOTA models currently outperform encoder-decoder models in majority of Urdu NLP tasks under zero-shot settings. However, comparing Llama 3.1-8B over prior version Llama 2-7B-Chat, we can deduce that with improved language coverage, LLMs can surpass these SOTA models. Our results emphasize that models with fewer parameters but richer language-specific data, like Llama 3.1-8B, often outperform larger models with lower language diversity, such as GPT-3.5, in several tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizun Wang, Xingyi Yang, Qiuhong Shen, Zhenxiang Jiang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recovering 4D world from monocular video is a crucial yet challenging task. Conventional methods usually rely on the assumptions of multi-view videos, known camera parameters, or static scenes. In this paper, we relax all these constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but practical task: With only one monocular video without camera parameters, we aim to recover the dynamic 3D world alongside the camera poses. To solve this, we introduce GFlow, a new framework that utilizes only 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video to a 4D scene, as a flow of 3D Gaussians through space and time. GFlow starts by segmenting the video into still and moving parts, then alternates between optimizing camera poses and the dynamics of the 3D Gaussian points. This method ensures consistency among adjacent points and smooth transitions between frames. Since dynamic scenes always continually introduce new visual content, we present prior-driven initialization and pixel-wise densification strategy for Gaussian points to integrate new content. By combining all those techniques, GFlow transcends the boundaries of 4D recovery from causal videos; it naturally enables tracking of points and segmentation of moving objects across frames. Additionally, GFlow estimates the camera poses for each frame, enabling novel view synthesis by changing camera pose. This capability facilitates extensive scene-level or object-level editing, highlighting GFlow's versatility and effectiveness. Visit our project page at: https://littlepure2333.github.io/GFlow</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuheng Wu, S. Farokh Atashzar, Mohammad M. Ghassemi, Tuka Alhanai</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive signal that is used in the recognition of hand movement patterns, the diagnosis of diseases, and the robust control of prostheses. Despite the remarkable success of recent end-to-end Deep Learning approaches, they are still limited by the need for large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the requirement for big data, we propose utilizing a feature-imitating network (FIN) for closed-form temporal feature learning over a 300ms signal window on Ninapro DB2, and applying it to the task of 17 hand movement recognition. We implement a lightweight LSTM-FIN network to imitate four standard temporal features (entropy, root mean square, variance, simple square integral). We observed that the LSTM-FIN network can achieve up to 99\% R2 accuracy in feature reconstruction and 80\% accuracy in hand movement recognition. Our results also showed that the model can be robustly applied for both within- and cross-subject movement recognition, as well as simulated low-latency environments. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of the FIN modeling paradigm in data-scarce scenarios for sEMG signal processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Zhou, Yan Shu, Bo Zhao, Boya Wu, Zhengyang Liang, Shitao Xiao, Minghao Qin, Xi Yang, Yongping Xiong, Bo Zhang, Tiejun Huang, Zheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation of Long Video Understanding (LVU) performance poses an important but challenging research problem. Despite previous efforts, the existing video understanding benchmarks are severely constrained by several issues, especially the insufficient lengths of videos, a lack of diversity in video types and evaluation tasks, and the inappropriateness for evaluating LVU performances. To address the above problems, we propose a new benchmark called MLVU (Multi-task Long Video Understanding Benchmark) for the comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of LVU. MLVU presents the following critical values: \textit{1)} The substantial and flexible extension of video lengths, which enables the benchmark to evaluate LVU performance across a wide range of durations. \textit{2)} The inclusion of various video genres, e.g., movies, surveillance footage, egocentric videos, cartoons, game videos, etc., which reflects the models' LVU performances in different scenarios. \textit{3)} The development of diversified evaluation tasks, which enables a comprehensive examination of MLLMs' key abilities in long-video understanding. The empirical study with 23 latest MLLMs reveals significant room for improvement in today's technique, as all existing methods struggle with most of the evaluation tasks and exhibit severe performance degradation when handling longer videos. Additionally, it suggests that factors such as context length, image-understanding ability, and the choice of LLM backbone can play critical roles in future advancements. We anticipate that MLVU will advance the research of long video understanding by providing a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiye Zhou, Shucheng Wang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the training of large language models, parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA optimize memory usage and reduce communication overhead and memory usage during the fine-tuning phase. However, applying such techniques directly during the pre-training phase results in poor performance, primarily because the premature implementation of low-rank training significantly reduces model accuracy. Existing methods like ReLoRA and GaLore have attempted to address this challenge by updating the low-rank subspace. However, they still fall short of achieving the accuracy of full-rank training. Specifically, ReLoRA restricts the frequency of updates to preserve optimizer states consistency, hindering its ability to closely approximate full-rank training behavior. Meanwhile, GaLore relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to approximate the full-rank space, which introduces accuracy loss during the approximation process. In this paper, we introduce SwitchLoRA, a parameter-efficient training technique that frequently and smoothly replaces the trainable parameters of LoRA adapters with alternative parameters. SwitchLoRA updates the low-rank subspace incrementally, targeting only a few dimensions at a time to minimize the impact on optimizer states. This allows a higher update frequency, thereby enhancing accuracy by enabling the updated parameters to more closely mimic full-rank behavior during the pre-training phase. Our results demonstrate that SwitchLoRA actually surpasses full-rank training, reducing perplexity from 15.23 to 15.01 on the LLaMA 1.3B model, while also cutting communication overhead by 54\% and memory usage by 13\%. Furthermore, after full fine-tuning the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model and the full-rank pre-trained model on the GLUE benchmark, the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model showed an average accuracy gain of about 1\% over the full-rank pre-trained model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems are increasingly being deployed across diverse industries and research domains. Developers and end-users interact with these systems through the use of prompting and prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering is a widely adopted and extensively researched area, it suffers from conflicting terminology and a fragmented ontological understanding of what constitutes an effective prompt due to its relatively recent emergence. We establish a structured understanding of prompt engineering by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their applications. We present a detailed vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. Additionally, we provide best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs such as ChatGPT. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting. As a culmination of these efforts, this paper presents the most comprehensive survey on prompt engineering to date.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanzeng Xia, Hao Liu, Yisong Yue, Tongxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm for solving reinforcement learning problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context decision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine well-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM, GPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve surprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of our framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs used for in-context decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley Brown, Jordan Juravsky, Ryan Ehrlich, Ronald Clark, Quoc V. Le, Christopher R\'e, Azalia Mirhoseini</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit models to making only one attempt at a problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling, using the simple technique of repeatedly sampling candidate solutions from a model. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage -- the fraction of problems that are solved by any generated sample -- scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-sample state-of-the-art of 43%. In domains without automatic verifiers, we find that common methods for picking from a sample collection (majority voting and reward models) plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyu Zhang, Zhengran Ji, Boyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bi'an Du, Lingbei Meng, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is a major challenge in computer vision, aiming to create complete three-dimensional models from limited viewing angles. Key obstacles include: 1) a small number of input images with inconsistent information; 2) dependence on input image quality; and 3) large model parameter sizes. To tackle these issues, we propose a self-augmented two-stage Gaussian splatting framework enhanced with structural masks for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Initially, our method generates a basic 3D Gaussian representation from sparse inputs and renders multi-view images. We then fine-tune a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to enhance these images, using them as augmented data to further optimize the 3D Gaussians. Additionally, a structural masking strategy during training enhances the model's robustness to sparse inputs and noise. Experiments on benchmarks like MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, and OpenIllumination demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and multi-view consistency with sparse inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Weber, Carly Beneke, Clyde Wheeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Regular measurement of carbon stock in the world's forests is critical for carbon accounting and reporting under national and international climate initiatives, and for scientific research, but has been largely limited in scalability and temporal resolution due to a lack of ground based assessments. Increasing efforts have been made to address these challenges by incorporating remotely sensed data. We present a new methodology which uses multi-sensor, multi-spectral imagery at a resolution of 10 meters and a deep learning based model which unifies the prediction of above ground biomass density (AGBD), canopy height (CH), canopy cover (CC) as well as uncertainty estimations for all three quantities. The model is trained on millions of globally sampled GEDI-L2/L4 measurements. We validate the capability of our model by deploying it over the entire globe for the year 2023 as well as annually from 2016 to 2023 over selected areas. The model achieves a mean absolute error for AGBD (CH, CC) of 26.1 Mg/ha (3.7 m, 9.9 %) and a root mean squared error of 50.6 Mg/ha (5.4 m, 15.8 %) on a globally sampled test dataset, demonstrating a significant improvement over previously published results. We also report the model performance against independently collected ground measurements published in the literature, which show a high degree of correlation across varying conditions. We further show that our pre-trained model facilitates seamless transferability to other GEDI variables due to its multi-head architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Li, Yuyang Zhang, Zhaolin Ren, Claire Liang, Na Li, Julie A. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive preference learning systems infer human preferences by presenting queries as pairs of options and collecting binary choices. Although binary choices are simple and widely used, they provide limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which are inversely related to preference strength, as an additional signal. We propose a computationally efficient method that combines choices and response times to estimate human utility functions, grounded in the EZ diffusion model from psychology. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that for queries with strong preferences, response times complement choices by providing extra information about preference strength, leading to significantly improved utility estimation. We incorporate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that using response times significantly accelerates preference learning compared to choice-only approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yooseok Lim, Sujee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate medication dosing holds an important position in the overall patient therapeutic process. Therefore, much research has been conducted to develop optimal administration strategy based on Reinforcement learning (RL). However, Relying solely on a few explicitly defined reward functions makes it difficult to learn a treatment strategy that encompasses the diverse characteristics of various patients. Moreover, the multitude of drugs utilized in clinical practice makes it infeasible to construct a dedicated reward function for each medication. Here, we tried to develop a reward network that captures clinicians' therapeutic intentions, departing from explicit rewards, and to derive an optimal heparin dosing policy. In this study, we introduce Offline Model-based Guided Reward Learning (OMG-RL), which performs offline inverse RL (IRL). Through OMG-RL, we learn a parameterized reward function that captures the expert's intentions from limited data, thereby enhancing the agent's policy. We validate the proposed approach on the heparin dosing task. We show that OMG-RL policy is positively reinforced not only in terms of the learned reward network but also in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), a key indicator for monitoring the effects of heparin. This means that the OMG-RL policy adequately reflects clinician's intentions. This approach can be widely utilized not only for the heparin dosing problem but also for RL-based medication dosing tasks in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Liu, Zunnan Xu, Yue Hu, Liangtao Shi, Zhiqiang Wang, Quanjun Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by an aligned prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Jionghao Lin, John Sabatini, Conrad Borchers, Daniel Weitekamp, Meng Cao, John Hollander, Xiangen Hu, Arthur C. Graesser</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning performance data describe correct and incorrect answers or problem-solving attempts in adaptive learning, such as in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Learning performance data tend to be highly sparse (80\%\(\sim\)90\% missing observations) in most real-world applications due to adaptive item selection. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict future performance explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learner data to address data sparsity in learning performance data. First, learning performance is represented as a three-dimensional tensor of learners' questions, answers, and attempts, capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, a module for generating patterns of learning is used. This study contrasts two forms of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generate Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) to generate data associated with different clusters of learner data. We tested this approach on an adult literacy dataset from AutoTutor lessons developed for Adult Reading Comprehension (ARC). We found that: (1) tensor factorization improved the performance in tracing and predicting knowledge mastery compared with other knowledge tracing techniques without data augmentation, showing higher relative fidelity for this imputation method, and (2) the GAN-based simulation showed greater overall stability and less statistical bias based on a divergence evaluation with varying simulation sample sizes compared to GPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Sam Chen, Christopher Beckham, Zixuan Liu, Xue Liu, Christopher Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline black-box optimization aims to maximize a black-box function using an offline dataset of designs and their measured properties. Two main approaches have emerged: the forward approach, which learns a mapping from input to its value, thereby acting as a proxy to guide optimization, and the inverse approach, which learns a mapping from value to input for conditional generation. (a) Although proxy-free~(classifier-free) diffusion shows promise in robustly modeling the inverse mapping, it lacks explicit guidance from proxies, essential for generating high-performance samples beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we propose \textit{proxy-enhanced sampling} which utilizes the explicit guidance from a trained proxy to bolster proxy-free diffusion with enhanced sampling control. (b) Yet, the trained proxy is susceptible to out-of-distribution issues. To address this, we devise the module \textit{diffusion-based proxy refinement}, which seamlessly integrates insights from proxy-free diffusion back into the proxy for refinement. To sum up, we propose \textit{\textbf{R}obust \textbf{G}uided \textbf{D}iffusion for Offline Black-box Optimization}~(\textbf{RGD}), combining the advantages of proxy~(explicit guidance) and proxy-free diffusion~(robustness) for effective conditional generation. RGD achieves state-of-the-art results on various design-bench tasks, underscoring its efficacy. Our code is at https://github.com/GGchen1997/RGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunseong Choi, Sunkyung Lee, Minjin Choi, June Park, Jongwuk Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains using advanced prompting techniques over various tasks. However, the increasing length of prompts leads to high computational costs and often obscures crucial information. Prompt compression has been proposed to alleviate these issues, but it faces challenges in (i) capturing the global context and (ii) training the compressor effectively. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt compression method, namely Reading To Compressing (R2C), utilizing the Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) architecture to identify the important information in the prompt. Specifically, the cross-attention scores of the FiD are used to discern essential chunks and sentences from the prompt. R2C effectively captures the global context without compromising semantic consistency while detouring the necessity of pseudo-labels for training the compressor. Empirical results show that R2C retains key contexts, enhancing the LLM performance by 6% in out-of-domain evaluations while reducing the prompt length by 80%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Jiang, Rui Meng, Xinyi Yang, Semih Yavuz, Yingbo Zhou, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite its importance and practicality. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets covering both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, which encodes text or images independently without any task instruction, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on SoTA VLMs like Phi-3.5-V, LLaVA-1.6 and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB. We show that VLMs are secretly strong embedding models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Wang, Anlin Zheng, Yucheng Zhao, Tiancai Wang, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Zhaoxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces reconstructive visual instruction tuning (ROSS), a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that exploit vision-centric supervision signals. In contrast to conventional visual instruction tuning approaches that exclusively supervise text outputs, ROSS prompts LMMs to supervise visual outputs via reconstructing input images. By doing so, it capitalizes on the inherent richness and detail present within input images themselves, which are often lost in pure text supervision. However, producing meaningful feedback from natural images is challenging due to the heavy spatial redundancy of visual signals. To address this issue, ROSS employs a denoising objective to reconstruct latent representations of input images, avoiding directly regressing exact raw RGB values. This intrinsic activation design inherently encourages LMMs to maintain image detail, thereby enhancing their fine-grained comprehension capabilities and reducing hallucinations. Empirically, ROSS consistently brings significant improvements across different visual encoders and language models. In comparison with extrinsic assistance state-of-the-art alternatives that aggregate multiple visual experts, ROSS delivers competitive performance with a single SigLIP visual encoder, demonstrating the efficacy of our vision-centric supervision tailored for visual outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently serving embedding-based recommendation (EMR) models remains a significant challenge due to their increasingly large memory requirements. Today's practice splits the model across many monolithic servers, where a mix of GPUs, CPUs, and DRAM is provisioned in fixed proportions. This approach leads to suboptimal resource utilization and increased costs. Disaggregating embedding operations from neural network inference is a promising solution but raises novel networking challenges. In this paper, we discuss the design of FlexEMR for optimized EMR disaggregation. FlexEMR proposes two sets of techniques to tackle the networking challenges: Leveraging the temporal and spatial locality of embedding lookups to reduce data movement over the network, and designing an optimized multi-threaded RDMA engine for concurrent lookup subrequests. We outline the design space for each technique and present initial results from our early prototype.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isack Lee, Haebin Seong</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as `jailbreaks', where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content bypassing safety alignments. In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and examine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We introduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords automatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to generate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method BiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually lead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more secure and unbiased. To enable further research and improvements, we open-source our code and artifacts of BiasJailbreak, providing the community with tools to better understand and mitigate safety-induced biases in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyi Li, Guande Wu, Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan, Dishita G Turakhia, Sonia Castelo Quispe, Dong Li, Leslie Welch, Claudio Silva, Jing Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmented Reality assistance are increasingly popular for supporting users with tasks like assembly and cooking. However, current practice typically provide reactive responses initialized from user requests, lacking consideration of rich contextual and user-specific information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel AR assistance system, Satori, that models both user states and environmental contexts to deliver proactive guidance. Our system combines the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model with a state-of-the-art multi-modal large language model (LLM) to infer contextually appropriate guidance. The design is informed by two formative studies involving twelve experts. A sixteen within-subject study find that Satori achieves performance comparable to an designer-created Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) system without relying on manual configurations or heuristics, thereby enhancing generalizability, reusability and opening up new possibilities for AR assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Li, Yangfan He, Lewei He, Jianhui Wang, Tianyu Shi, Bin Lei, Yuchen Li, Qiuwu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoliang Liu, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling has garnered significant attention from the research community, largely due to the substantial advancements of the o1 model released by OpenAI. By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. The implemented framework is denoted as \textbf{STILL-1}. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and conduct extensive evaluations on four challenging datasets, significantly enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Schestakov, Simon Gottschalk</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving optimal performance of video diffusion transformers within given data and compute budget is crucial due to their high training costs. This necessitates precisely determining the optimal model size and training hyperparameters before large-scale training. While scaling laws are employed in language models to predict performance, their existence and accurate derivation in visual generation models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically analyze scaling laws for video diffusion transformers and confirm their presence. Moreover, we discover that, unlike language models, video diffusion models are more sensitive to learning rate and batch size, two hyperparameters often not precisely modeled. To address this, we propose a new scaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and compute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance and reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods, within a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more generalized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and compute budget. This enables performance prediction for non-optimal model sizes, which may also be appealed under practical inference cost constraints, achieving a better trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Xu, Hanyin Cheng, Chenjuan Guo, Hongfan Gao, Jilin Hu, Sean Bin Yang, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing effective path representations has become increasingly essential across various fields within intelligent transportation. Although pre-trained path representation learning models have shown improved performance, they predominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data, i.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features associated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to human understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can provide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and generalization. However, variations in information granularity impede the semantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based paths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses substantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning Framework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by integrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the alignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment strategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths with their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both detailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the heterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based cross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse information across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Lin, Mingjie Li, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their outstanding performance in handling graph-related tasks, such as social network analysis, protein design, and so on. Despite their widespread application, recent research has demonstrated that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, implemented by injecting triggers into the training datasets. Trained on the poisoned data, GNNs will predict target labels when attaching trigger patterns to inputs. This vulnerability poses significant security risks for applications of GNNs in sensitive domains, such as drug discovery. While there has been extensive research into backdoor defenses for images, strategies to safeguard GNNs against such attacks remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, we point out that conventional backdoor defense methods designed for images cannot work well when directly implemented on graph data. In this paper, we first analyze the key difference between image backdoor and graph backdoor attacks. Then we tackle the graph defense problem by presenting a novel approach called MADE, which devises an adversarial mask generation mechanism that selectively preserves clean sub-graphs and further leverages masks on edge weights to eliminate the influence of triggers effectively. Extensive experiments across various graph classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MADE in significantly reducing the attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a high classification accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and high-quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leizhen Wang, Peibo Duan, Zhengbing He, Cheng Lyu, Xin Chen, Nan Zheng, Li Yao, Zhenliang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding travelers' route choices can help policymakers devise optimal operational and planning strategies for both normal and abnormal circumstances. However, existing choice modeling methods often rely on predefined assumptions and struggle to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of travel behavior. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating remarkable ability to replicate human-like behaviors across various fields. Despite this potential, their capacity to accurately simulate human route choice behavior in transportation contexts remains doubtful. To satisfy this curiosity, this paper investigates the potential of LLMs for route choice modeling by introducing an LLM-empowered agent, "LLMTraveler." This agent integrates an LLM as its core, equipped with a memory system that learns from past experiences and makes decisions by balancing retrieved data and personality traits. The study systematically evaluates the LLMTraveler's ability to replicate human-like decision-making through two stages of day-to-day (DTD) congestion games: (1) analyzing its route-switching behavior in single origin-destination (OD) pair scenarios, where it demonstrates patterns that align with laboratory data but cannot be fully explained by traditional models, and (2) testing its capacity to model adaptive learning behaviors in multi-OD scenarios on the Ortuzar and Willumsen (OW) network, producing results comparable to Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. These experiments demonstrate that the framework can partially replicate human-like decision-making in route choice while providing natural language explanations for its decisions. This capability offers valuable insights for transportation policymaking, such as simulating traveler responses to new policies or changes in the network.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on developing translation models and related applications for 36 Indian languages, including Assamese, Awadhi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bodo, Dogri, English, Konkani, Gondi, Gujarati, Hindi, Hinglish, Ho, Kannada, Kangri, Kashmiri (Arabic and Devanagari), Khasi, Mizo, Magahi, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Manipuri (Bengali and Meitei), Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sinhala, Sindhi (Arabic and Devanagari), Tamil, Tulu, Telugu, and Urdu. Achieving this requires parallel and other types of corpora for all 36 * 36 language pairs, addressing challenges like script variations, phonetic differences, and syntactic diversity. For instance, languages like Kashmiri and Sindhi, which use multiple scripts, demand script normalization for alignment, while low-resource languages such as Khasi and Santali require synthetic data augmentation to ensure sufficient coverage and quality.
  To address these challenges, this work proposes strategies for corpus creation by leveraging existing resources, developing parallel datasets, generating domain-specific corpora, and utilizing synthetic data techniques. Additionally, it evaluates machine translation across various dimensions, including standard and discourse-level translation, domain-specific translation, reference-based and reference-free evaluation, error analysis, and automatic post-editing. By integrating these elements, the study establishes a comprehensive framework to improve machine translation quality and enable better cross-lingual communication in India's linguistically diverse ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa) tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings. However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Fang, Yuxuan Liang, Bo Hui, Zezhi Shao, Liwei Deng, Xu Liu, Xinke Jiang, Kai Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Road traffic forecasting is crucial in real-world intelligent transportation scenarios like traffic dispatching and path planning in city management and personal traveling. Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) stand out as the mainstream solution in this task. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of remarkable dynamic spatial modeling-based STGNNs has become the bottleneck over large-scale traffic data. From the spatial data management perspective, we present a novel Transformer framework called PatchSTG to efficiently and dynamically model spatial dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting with interpretability and fidelity. Specifically, we design a novel irregular spatial patching to reduce the number of points involved in the dynamic calculation of Transformer. The irregular spatial patching first utilizes the leaf K-dimensional tree (KDTree) to recursively partition irregularly distributed traffic points into leaf nodes with a small capacity, and then merges leaf nodes belonging to the same subtree into occupancy-equaled and non-overlapped patches through padding and backtracking. Based on the patched data, depth and breadth attention are used interchangeably in the encoder to dynamically learn local and global spatial knowledge from points in a patch and points with the same index of patches. Experimental results on four real world large-scale traffic datasets show that our PatchSTG achieves train speed and memory utilization improvements up to $10\times$ and $4\times$ with the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meihao Fan, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Lei Cao, Guoliang Li, Xiaoyong Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column augmentation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Liu, Monde Duinkharjav, Qi Sun, Sai Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging real-time eye-tracking, foveated rendering optimizes hardware efficiency and enhances visual quality virtual reality (VR). This approach leverages eye-tracking techniques to determine where the user is looking, allowing the system to render high-resolution graphics only in the foveal region-the small area of the retina where visual acuity is highest, while the peripheral view is rendered at lower resolution. However, modern deep learning-based gaze-tracking solutions often exhibit a long-tail distribution of tracking errors, which can degrade user experience and reduce the benefits of foveated rendering by causing misalignment and decreased visual quality.
  This paper introduces \textit{FovealNet}, an advanced AI-driven gaze tracking framework designed to optimize system performance by strategically enhancing gaze tracking accuracy. To further reduce the implementation cost of the gaze tracking algorithm, FovealNet employs an event-based cropping method that eliminates over $64.8\%$ of irrelevant pixels from the input image. Additionally, it incorporates a simple yet effective token-pruning strategy that dynamically removes tokens on the fly without compromising tracking accuracy. Finally, to support different runtime rendering configurations, we propose a system performance-aware multi-resolution training strategy, allowing the gaze tracking DNN to adapt and optimize overall system performance more effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that FovealNet achieves at least $1.42\times$ speed up compared to previous methods and 13\% increase in perceptual quality for foveated output.</p>

<p>Abstract: Collaborative machine learning (CML) provides a promising paradigm for democratizing advanced technologies by enabling cost-sharing among participants. However, the potential for rent-seeking behaviors among parties can undermine such collaborations. Contract theory presents a viable solution by rewarding participants with models of varying accuracy based on their contributions. However, unlike monetary compensation, using models as rewards introduces unique challenges, particularly due to the stochastic nature of these rewards when contribution costs are privately held information. This paper formalizes the optimal contracting problem within CML and proposes a transformation that simplifies the non-convex optimization problem into one that can be solved through convex optimization algorithms. We conduct a detailed analysis of the properties that an optimal contract must satisfy when models serve as the rewards, and we explore the potential benefits and welfare implications of these contract-driven CML schemes through numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Wang, Adam Meyers, John E. Ortega, Rodolfo Zevallos</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating between languages with drastically different grammatical conventions poses challenges, not just for human interpreters but also for machine translation systems. In this work, we specifically target the translation challenges posed by attributive nouns in Chinese, which frequently cause ambiguities in English translation. By manually inserting the omitted particle X ('DE'). In news article titles from the Penn Chinese Discourse Treebank, we developed a targeted dataset to fine-tune Hugging Face Chinese to English translation models, specifically improving how this critical function word is handled. This focused approach not only complements the broader strategies suggested by previous studies but also offers a practical enhancement by specifically addressing a common error type in Chinese-English translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Brouwer, Jan Erik van Woerden, Gertjan Burghouts, Matias Valdenegro-Toro, Marco Zullich</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot, fine-grained classification in computer vision poses significant challenges due to the need to differentiate subtle class distinctions with limited data. This paper presents a novel method that enhances the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model through adaptive prompt tuning, guided by real-time visual inputs. Unlike existing techniques such as Context Optimization (CoOp) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), which are constrained by static prompts or visual token reliance, the proposed approach leverages a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically refine text prompts for the image at hand. This enables an image-specific alignment of textual features with image patches extracted from the Vision Transformer, making the model more effective for datasets with high intra-class variance and low inter-class differences. The method is evaluated on several datasets, including CUBirds, Oxford Flowers, and FGVC Aircraft, showing significant performance gains over static prompt tuning approaches. To ensure these performance gains translate into trustworthy predictions, we integrate Monte-Carlo Dropout in our approach to improve the reliability of the model predictions and uncertainty estimates. This integration provides valuable insights into the model's predictive confidence, helping to identify when predictions can be trusted and when additional verification is necessary. This dynamic approach offers a robust solution, advancing the state-of-the-art for few-shot fine-grained classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samarth Goel, Reagan J. Lee, Kannan Ramchandran</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models are crucial for tasks in Information Retrieval (IR) and semantic similarity measurement, yet their handling of longer texts and associated positional biases remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of content position and input size on text embeddings. Our experiments reveal that embedding models, irrespective of their positional encoding mechanisms, disproportionately prioritize the beginning of an input. Ablation studies demonstrate that insertion of irrelevant text or removal at the start of a document reduces cosine similarity between altered and original embeddings by up to 12.3% more than ablations at the end. Regression analysis further confirms this bias, with sentence importance declining as position moves further from the start, even with with content-agnosticity. We hypothesize that this effect arises from pre-processing strategies and chosen positional encoding techniques. These findings quantify the sensitivity of retrieval systems and suggest a new lens towards embedding model robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning, yet their potential in finance remains underexplored due to the complexity and specialization of financial knowledge. In this work, we report the development of the Baichuan4-Finance series, including a comprehensive suite of foundational Baichuan4-Finance-Base and an aligned language model Baichuan4-Finance, which are built upon Baichuan4-Turbo base model and tailored for finance domain. Firstly, we have dedicated significant effort to building a detailed pipeline for improving data quality. Moreover, in the continual pre-training phase, we propose a novel domain self-constraint training strategy, which enables Baichuan4-Finance-Base to acquire financial knowledge without losing general capabilities. After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to tackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario applications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general datasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show that Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks. At the same time, Baichuan4-Finance demonstrates even more impressive performance on financial application scenarios, showcasing its potential to foster community innovation in the financial LLM field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritwik Raj Saxena</p>
<p>Abstract: Concerns associated with occupational health and safety (OHS) remain critical and often under-addressed aspects of workforce management. This is especially true for high-risk industries such as manufacturing, construction, and mining. Such industries dominate the economy of India which is a developing country with a vast informal sector. Regulatory frameworks have been strengthened over the decades, particularly with regards to bringing the unorganized sector within the purview of law. Traditional approaches to OHS have largely been reactive and rely on post-incident analysis (which is curative) rather than preventive intervention. This paper portrays the immense potential of predictive analytics in rejuvenating OHS practices in India. Intelligent predictive analytics is driven by approaches like machine learning and statistical modeling. Its data-driven nature serves to overcome the limitations of conventional OHS methods. Predictive analytics approaches to OHS in India draw on global case studies and generative applications of predictive analytics in OHS which are customized to Indian industrial contexts. This paper attempts to explore in what ways it exhibits the potential to address challenges such as fragmented data ecosystems, resource constraints, and the variability of workplace hazards. The paper presents actionable policy recommendations to create conditions conducive to the widespread implementation of predictive analytics, which must be advocated as a cornerstone of OHS strategy. In doing so, the paper aims to spark a collaborational dialogue among policymakers, industry leaders, and technologists. It urges a shift towards intelligent practices to safeguard the well-being of India's workforce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uzoamaka Ezeakunne, Chrisantus Eze, Xiuwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the progress made in deepfake detection research, recent studies have shown that biases in the training data for these detectors can result in varying levels of performance across different demographic groups, such as race and gender. These disparities can lead to certain groups being unfairly targeted or excluded. Traditional methods often rely on fair loss functions to address these issues, but they under-perform when applied to unseen datasets, hence, fairness generalization remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for tackling the fairness generalization problem in deepfake detection by leveraging synthetic datasets and model optimization. Our approach focuses on generating and utilizing synthetic data to enhance fairness across diverse demographic groups. By creating a diverse set of synthetic samples that represent various demographic groups, we ensure that our model is trained on a balanced and representative dataset. This approach allows us to generalize fairness more effectively across different domains. We employ a comprehensive strategy that leverages synthetic data, a loss sharpness-aware optimization pipeline, and a multi-task learning framework to create a more equitable training environment, which helps maintain fairness across both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Extensive experiments on benchmark deepfake detection datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches in preserving fairness during cross-dataset evaluation. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic datasets in achieving fairness generalization, providing a robust solution for the challenges faced in deepfake detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Do June Min, Karel Mundnich, Andy Lapastora, Erfan Soltanmohammadi, Srikanth Ronanki, Kyu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces text2midi, an end-to-end model to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that are indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms such as chords, keys, and tempo. We release the code and music samples on our demo page (https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/Text2midi) for users to interact with text2midi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyu Wang, Zizhen Lin, Tianrui Wang, Meng Ge, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent speech enhancement (SE) research, transformer and its variants have emerged as the predominant methodologies. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism imposes certain limitations on practical deployment. Mamba, as a novel state-space model (SSM), has gained widespread application in natural language processing and computer vision due to its strong capabilities in modeling long sequences and relatively low computational complexity. In this work, we introduce Mamba-SEUNet, an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba with U-Net for SE tasks. By leveraging bidirectional Mamba to model forward and backward dependencies of speech signals at different resolutions, and incorporating skip connections to capture multi-scale information, our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Experimental results on the VCTK+DEMAND dataset indicate that Mamba-SEUNet attains a PESQ score of 3.59, while maintaining low computational complexity. When combined with the Perceptual Contrast Stretching technique, Mamba-SEUNet further improves the PESQ score to 3.73.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Chen, Jiayan Huo, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time, i.e., $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens, algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings. However, achieving a subquadratic time algorithm for other parameter regimes remains impossible unless the widely accepted Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is disproven. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the SETH, the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophia Tang, Yinuo Zhang, Pranam Chatterjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Peptide therapeutics, a major class of medicines, have achieved remarkable success across diseases such as diabetes and cancer, with landmark examples such as GLP-1 receptor agonists revolutionizing the treatment of type-2 diabetes and obesity. Despite their success, designing peptides that satisfy multiple conflicting objectives, such as target binding affinity, solubility, and membrane permeability, remains a major challenge. Classical drug development and structure-based design are ineffective for such tasks, as they fail to optimize global functional properties critical for therapeutic efficacy. Existing generative frameworks are largely limited to continuous spaces, unconditioned outputs, or single-objective guidance, making them unsuitable for discrete sequence optimization across multiple properties. To address this, we present PepTune, a multi-objective discrete diffusion model for the simultaneous generation and optimization of therapeutic peptide SMILES. Built on the Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) framework, PepTune ensures valid peptide structures with state-dependent masking schedules and penalty-based objectives. To guide the diffusion process, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based strategy that balances exploration and exploitation to iteratively refine Pareto-optimal sequences. MCTS integrates classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and data sparsity inherent to discrete spaces. Using PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides optimized for multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling characteristics on various disease-relevant targets. In total, our results demonstrate that MCTS-guided discrete diffusion is a powerful and modular approach for multi-objective sequence design in discrete state spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop an MLLM that understands and solves questions by learning to create each intermediate step of the reasoning involved till the final answer. To this end, we propose Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search (CoMCTS), a new learning-to-reason method for MLLMs, which introduces the concept of collective learning into ``tree search'' for effective and efficient reasoning-path searching and learning. The core idea of CoMCTS is to leverage collective knowledge from multiple models to collaboratively conjecture, search and identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers via four iterative operations including Expansion, Simulation and Error Positioning, Backpropagation, and Selection. Using CoMCTS, we construct Mulberry-260k, a multimodal dataset with a tree of rich, explicit and well-defined reasoning nodes for each question. With Mulberry-260k, we perform collective SFT to train our model, Mulberry, a series of MLLMs with o1-like step-by-step Reasoning and Reflection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods on various benchmarks. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxu Han, Zhenting Wang, Chunrong Fang, Shiyu Zhao, Shiqing Ma, Zhenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Ben Abacha, Wen-wai Yim, Yujuan Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Meliha Yetisgen, Fei Xia, Thomas Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in textual understanding and tabular reasoning tasks. However, their ability to comprehend and analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains unexplored. The hybrid text often appears in the form of hybrid long documents (HLDs), which far exceed the token limit of LLMs. Consequently, we apply an Automated Information Extraction framework (AIE) to enable LLMs to process the HLDs and carry out experiments to analyse four important aspects of information extraction from HLDs. Given the findings: 1) The effective way to select and summarize the useful part of a HLD. 2) An easy table serialization way is enough for LLMs to understand tables. 3) The naive AIE has adaptability in many complex scenarios. 4) The useful prompt engineering to enhance LLMs on HLDs. To address the issue of dataset scarcity in HLDs and support future work, we also propose the Financial Reports Numerical Extraction (FINE) dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Jing, Mengyun Tang, Xiaorong Shi, Xing Zheng, Sen Nie, Shi Wu, Yong Yang, Xiapu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations across various applications, including natural language processing and code generation. Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval, and HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert domains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity datasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a reliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address these gaps, we propose SecBench, a multi-dimensional benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. SecBench includes questions in various formats (MCQs and short-answer questions (SAQs)), at different capability levels (Knowledge Retention and Logical Reasoning), in multiple languages (Chinese and English), and across various sub-domains. The dataset was constructed by collecting high-quality data from open sources and organizing a Cybersecurity Question Design Contest, resulting in 44,823 MCQs and 3,087 SAQs. Particularly, we used the powerful while cost-effective LLMs to (1). label the data and (2). constructing a grading agent for automatic evaluation of SAQs. Benchmarking results on 13 SOTA LLMs demonstrate the usability of SecBench, which is arguably the largest and most comprehensive benchmark dataset for LLMs in cybersecurity. More information about SecBench can be found at our website, and the dataset can be accessed via the artifact link.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Supriya Manna, Niladri Sett</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning's preponderance across scientific domains has reshaped high-stakes decision-making, making it essential to follow rigorous operational frameworks that include both Right-to-Privacy (RTP) and Right-to-Explanation (RTE). This paper examines the complexities of combining these two requirements. For RTP, we focus on `Differential privacy' (DP), which is considered the current \textit{gold standard} for privacy-preserving machine learning due to its strong quantitative guarantee of privacy. For RTE, we focus on post-hoc explainers: they are the \textit{go-to} option for model auditing as they operate independently of model training. We formally investigate DP models and various commonly-used post-hoc explainers: how to evaluate these explainers subject to RTP, and analyze the intrinsic interactions between DP models and these explainers. Furthermore, our work throws light on how RTP and RTE can be effectively combined in high-stakes applications. Our study concludes by outlining an industrial software pipeline, with the example of a wildly used use-case, that respects both RTP and RTE requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joonwon Jang, Jaehee Kim, Wonbin Kweon, Hwanjo Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While generating multiple reasoning paths or iteratively refining rationales proves effective for improving performance, these approaches inevitably result in significantly higher inference costs. In this work, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction training framework that leverages likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches that utilize token-level reduction, our sentence-level reduction framework maintains model performance while reducing generation length. This preserves the original reasoning abilities of LLMs and achieves an average 17.15% reduction in generation costs across various models and tasks.</p>
