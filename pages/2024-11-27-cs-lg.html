<p><b>Authors:</b> Aydin Zaboli, Seong Lok Choi, Junho Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses critical challenges of cybersecurity in digital substations by proposing an innovative task-oriented dialogue (ToD) system for anomaly detection (AD) in multicast messages, specifically, generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) and sampled value (SV) datasets. Leveraging generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology, the proposed framework demonstrates superior error reduction, scalability, and adaptability compared with traditional human-in-the-loop (HITL) processes. Notably, this methodology offers significant advantages over machine learning (ML) techniques in terms of efficiency and implementation speed when confronting novel and/or unknown cyber threats, while also maintaining model complexity and precision. The research employs advanced performance metrics to conduct a comparative assessment between the proposed AD and HITL-based AD frameworks, utilizing a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed for generating and extracting features of IEC61850 communication messages. This approach presents a promising solution for enhancing the reliability of power system operations in the face of evolving cybersecurity challenges.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16728">Maximizing the Impact of Deep Learning on Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Climate Forecasting: The Essential Role of Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhen Guo, Tian Zhou, Wanyi Jiang, Bo Wu, Liang Sun, Rong Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Weather and climate forecasting is vital for sectors such as agriculture and disaster management. Although numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems have advanced, forecasting at the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) scale, spanning 2 to 6 weeks, remains challenging due to the chaotic and sparse atmospheric signals at this interval. Even state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle to outperform simple climatology models in this domain. This paper identifies that optimization, instead of network structure, could be the root cause of this performance gap, and then we develop a novel multi-stage optimization strategy to close the gap. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our multi-stage optimization approach significantly improves key skill metrics, PCC and TCC, while utilizing the same backbone structure, surpassing the state-of-the-art NWP systems (ECMWF-S2S) by over \textbf{19-91\%}. Our research contests the recent study that direct forecasting outperforms rolling forecasting for S2S tasks. Through theoretical analysis, we propose that the underperformance of rolling forecasting may arise from the accumulation of Jacobian matrix products during training. Our multi-stage framework can be viewed as a form of teacher forcing to address this issue. Code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Baguan-S2S-23E7/}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Dutta, Iago Leal de Freitas, Pedro Maciel Xavier, Claudio Miceli de Farias, David Esteban Bernal Neira</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach that has gained attention for its potential to enable collaborative model training across clients while protecting data privacy, making it an attractive solution for the chemical industry. This work aims to provide the chemical engineering community with an accessible introduction to the discipline. Supported by a hands-on tutorial and a comprehensive collection of examples, it explores the application of FL in tasks such as manufacturing optimization, multimodal data integration, and drug discovery while addressing the unique challenges of protecting proprietary information and managing distributed datasets. The tutorial was built using key frameworks such as $\texttt{Flower}$ and $\texttt{TensorFlow Federated}$ and was designed to provide chemical engineers with the right tools to adopt FL in their specific needs. We compare the performance of FL against centralized learning across three different datasets relevant to chemical engineering applications, demonstrating that FL will often maintain or improve classification performance, particularly for complex and heterogeneous data. We conclude with an outlook on the open challenges in federated learning to be tackled and current approaches designed to remediate and improve this framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi-Yi Chin, Kuan-Chen Mu, Mario Fritz, Pin-Yu Chen, Wei-Chen Chiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have shown remarkable progress, but their potential to generate harmful content remains a critical concern in the ML community. While various safety mechanisms have been developed, the field lacks systematic tools for evaluating their effectiveness against real-world misuse scenarios. In this work, we propose ICER, a novel red-teaming framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and a bandit optimization-based algorithm to generate interpretable and semantic meaningful problematic prompts by learning from past successful red-teaming attempts. Our ICER efficiently probes safety mechanisms across different T2I models without requiring internal access or additional training, making it broadly applicable to deployed systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICER significantly outperforms existing prompt attack methods in identifying model vulnerabilities while maintaining high semantic similarity with intended content. By uncovering that successful jailbreaking instances can systematically facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities, our work provides crucial insights for developing more robust safety mechanisms in T2I systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuan Liu, Huanran Chen, Yichi Zhang, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: A longstanding problem of deep learning models is their vulnerability to adversarial examples, which are often generated by applying imperceptible perturbations to natural examples. Adversarial examples exhibit cross-model transferability, enabling to attack black-box models with limited information about their architectures and parameters. Model ensembling is an effective strategy to improve the transferability by attacking multiple surrogate models simultaneously. However, as prior studies usually adopt few models in the ensemble, there remains an open question of whether scaling the number of models can further improve black-box attacks. Inspired by the findings in large foundation models, we investigate the scaling laws of black-box adversarial attacks in this work. By analyzing the relationship between the number of surrogate models and transferability of adversarial examples, we conclude with clear scaling laws, emphasizing the potential of using more surrogate models to enhance adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments verify the claims on standard image classifiers, multimodal large language models, and even proprietary models like GPT-4o, demonstrating consistent scaling effects and impressive attack success rates with more surrogate models. Further studies by visualization indicate that scaled attacks bring better interpretability in semantics, indicating that the common features of models are captured.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukti Makhija, Edward De Brouwer, Rahul G. Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Checklists have been widely recognized as effective tools for completing complex tasks in a systematic manner. Although originally intended for use in procedural tasks, their interpretability and ease of use have led to their adoption for predictive tasks as well, including in clinical settings. However, designing checklists can be challenging, often requiring expert knowledge and manual rule design based on available data. Recent work has attempted to address this issue by using machine learning to automatically generate predictive checklists from data, although these approaches have been limited to Boolean data. We propose a novel method for learning predictive checklists from diverse data modalities, such as images and time series.
  Our approach relies on probabilistic logic programming, a learning paradigm that enables matching the discrete nature of checklist with continuous-valued data. We propose a regularization technique to tradeoff between the information captured in discrete concepts of continuous data and permit a tunable level of interpretability for the learned checklist concepts. We demonstrate that our method outperforms various explainable machine learning techniques on prediction tasks involving image sequences, time series, and clinical notes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruofan Jia, Weiying Xie, Jie Lei, Haonan Qin, Jitao Ma, Leyuan Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: As demand grows for complex tasks and high-performance applications in edge computing, the deployment of large models in federated learning has become increasingly urgent, given their superior representational power and generalization capabilities. However, the resource constraints and heterogeneity among clients present significant challenges to this deployment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HeteroTune, an innovative fine-tuning framework tailored for model-heterogeneity federated learning (MHFL). In particular, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) structure, called FedAdapter, which employs a multi-branch cross-model aggregator to enable efficient knowledge aggregation across diverse models. Benefiting from the lightweight FedAdapter, our approach significantly reduces both the computational and communication overhead. Finally, our approach is simple yet effective, making it applicable to a wide range of large model fine-tuning tasks. Extensive experiments on computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating efficiency and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charita Dellaporta, Patrick O'Hara, Theodoros Damoulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision making under uncertainty is challenging as the data-generating process (DGP) is often unknown. Bayesian inference proceeds by estimating the DGP through posterior beliefs on the model's parameters. However, minimising the expected risk under these beliefs can lead to suboptimal decisions due to model uncertainty or limited, noisy observations. To address this, we introduce Distributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-BAS) which hedges against model uncertainty by optimising the worst-case risk over a posterior-informed ambiguity set. We provide two such sets, based on posterior expectations (DRO-BAS(PE)) or posterior predictives (DRO-BAS(PP)) and prove that both admit, under conditions, strong dual formulations leading to efficient single-stage stochastic programs which are solved with a sample average approximation. For DRO-BAS(PE) this covers all conjugate exponential family members while for DRO-BAS(PP) this is shown under conditions on the predictive's moment generating function. Our DRO-BAS formulations Pareto dominate existing Bayesian DRO on the Newsvendor problem and achieve faster solve times with comparable robustness on the Portfolio problem.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16895">Explainable AI Approach using Near Misses Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eran Kaufman, Avivit levy</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel XAI approach based on near-misses analysis (NMA). This approach reveals a hierarchy of logical 'concepts' inferred from the latent decision-making process of a Neural Network (NN) without delving into its explicit structure. We examined our proposed XAI approach on different network architectures that vary in size and shape (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, MobileNet) on several datasets (ImageNet and CIFAR100). The results demonstrate its usability to reflect NNs latent process of concepts generation. We generated a new metric for explainability. Moreover, our experiments suggest that efficient architectures, which achieve a similar accuracy level with much less neurons may still pay the price of explainability and robustness in terms of concepts generation. We, thus, pave a promising new path for XAI research to follow.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16914">Curvature in the Looking-Glass: Optimal Methods to Exploit Curvature of Expectation in the Loss Landscape</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jed A. Duersch, Tommie A. Catanach, Alexander Safonov, Jeremy Wendt</p>
<p>Abstract: Harnessing the local topography of the loss landscape is a central challenge in advanced optimization tasks. By accounting for the effect of potential parameter changes, we can alter the model more efficiently. Contrary to standard assumptions, we find that the Hessian does not always approximate loss curvature well, particularly near gradient discontinuities, which commonly arise in deep learning architectures.
  We present a new conceptual framework to understand how curvature of expected changes in loss emerges in architectures with many rectified linear units. Each ReLU creates a parameter boundary that, when crossed, induces a pseudorandom gradient perturbation. Our derivations show how these discontinuities combine to form a glass-like structure, similar to amorphous solids that contain microscopic domains of strong, but random, atomic alignment. By estimating the density of the resulting gradient variations, we can bound how the loss may change with parameter movement. Our analysis includes the optimal kernel and sample distribution for approximating glass density from ordinary gradient evaluations. We also derive the optimal modification to quasi-Newton steps that incorporate both glass and Hessian terms, as well as certain exactness properties that are possible with Nesterov-accelerated gradient updates.
  Our algorithm, Alice, tests these techniques to determine which curvature terms are most impactful for training a given architecture and dataset. Additional safeguards enforce stable exploitation through step bounds that expand on the functionality of Adam. These theoretical and experimental tools lay groundwork to improve future efforts (e.g., pruning and quantization) by providing new insight into the loss landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in scientific assistants that could support researchers across the full spectrum of scientific workflows, from literature review to experimental design and data analysis. A key capability for such systems is the ability to process and reason about scientific information in both visual and textual forms - from interpreting spectroscopic data to understanding laboratory setups. Here, we introduce MaCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how vision-language models handle real-world chemistry and materials science tasks across three core aspects: data extraction, experimental understanding, and results interpretation. Through a systematic evaluation of leading models, we find that while these systems show promising capabilities in basic perception tasks - achieving near-perfect performance in equipment identification and standardized data extraction - they exhibit fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning, cross-modal information synthesis, and multi-step logical inference. Our insights have important implications beyond chemistry and materials science, suggesting that developing reliable multimodal AI scientific assistants may require advances in curating suitable training data and approaches to training those models.</p>

Traditional time series clustering methods often struggle to capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in such data. In this paper, we propose the Variational Mixture Graph Autoencoder (VMGAE), a graph-based approach for time series clustering that leverages the structural advantages of graphs to capture enriched data relationships and produces Gaussian mixture embeddings for improved separability. Comparisons with baseline methods are included with experimental results, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art time-series clustering techniques. We further validate our method on real-world financial data, highlighting its practical applications in finance. By uncovering community structures in stock markets, our method provides deeper insights into stock relationships, benefiting market prediction, portfolio optimization, and risk management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zan Chaudhry, Naoko Mizuno</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning remains a significant challenge for the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), requiring manual and/or time-intensive grid searches, increasing resource costs and presenting a barrier to the democratization of machine learning. The global initial learning rate for DNN training is particularly important. Several techniques have been proposed for automated learning rate tuning during training; however, they still require manual searching for the global initial learning rate. Though methods exist that do not require this initial selection, they suffer from poor performance. Here, we present ExpTest, a sophisticated method for initial learning rate searching and subsequent learning rate tuning for the training of DNNs. ExpTest draws on insights from linearized neural networks and the form of the loss curve, which we treat as a real-time signal upon which we perform hypothesis testing. We mathematically justify ExpTest and provide empirical support. ExpTest requires minimal overhead, is robust to hyperparameter choice, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks and architectures, without initial learning rate selection or learning rate scheduling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amar Kulkarni, Shangtong Zhang, Madhur Behl</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires identifying rare but critical failure cases that on-road testing alone cannot discover. High-fidelity simulations provide a scalable alternative, but automatically generating realistic and diverse traffic scenarios that can effectively stress test AV motion planners remains a key challenge. This paper introduces CRASH - Challenging Reinforcement-learning based Adversarial scenarios for Safety Hardening - an adversarial deep reinforcement learning framework to address this issue. First CRASH can control adversarial Non Player Character (NPC) agents in an AV simulator to automatically induce collisions with the Ego vehicle, falsifying its motion planner. We also propose a novel approach, that we term safety hardening, which iteratively refines the motion planner by simulating improvement scenarios against adversarial agents, leveraging the failure cases to strengthen the AV stack. CRASH is evaluated on a simplified two-lane highway scenario, demonstrating its ability to falsify both rule-based and learning-based planners with collision rates exceeding 90%. Additionally, safety hardening reduces the Ego vehicle's collision rate by 26%. While preliminary, these results highlight RL-based safety hardening as a promising approach for scenario-driven simulation testing for autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>Abstract: The prevailing mindset is that a single decision tree underperforms classic random forests in testing accuracy, despite its advantages in interpretability and lightweight structure. This study challenges such a mindset by significantly improving the testing accuracy of an oblique regression tree through our gradient-based entire tree optimization framework, making its performance comparable to the classic random forest. Our approach reformulates tree training as a differentiable unconstrained optimization task, employing a scaled sigmoid approximation strategy. To ameliorate numerical instability, we propose an algorithmic scheme that solves a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations. Additionally, a subtree polish strategy is implemented to reduce approximation errors accumulated across the tree. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that our optimized tree outperforms the classic random forest by an average of $2.03\%$ improvements in testing accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Cooper-Baldock, Paulo E. Santos, Russell S. A. Brinkworth, Karl Sammut</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are crucial in automotive, aerospace, maritime and medical applications, but are limited by the complexity, cost and computational requirements of directly calculating the flow, often taking days of compute time. Machine-learning architectures, such as controlled generative adversarial networks (cGANs) hold significant potential in enhancing or replacing CFD investigations, due to cGANs ability to approximate the underlying data distribution of a dataset. Unlike traditional cGAN applications, where the entire image carries information, CFD data contains small regions of highly variant data, immersed in a large context of low variance that is of minimal importance. This renders most existing deep learning techniques that give equal importance to every portion of the data during training, inefficient. To mitigate this, a novel loss function is proposed called Gradient Mean Squared Error (GMSE) which automatically and dynamically identifies the regions of importance on a field-by-field basis, assigning appropriate weights according to the local variance. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, three identical networks were trained; optimised with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, proposed GMSE loss and a dynamic variant of GMSE (DGMSE). The novel loss function resulted in faster loss convergence, correlating to reduced training time, whilst also displaying an 83.6% reduction in structural similarity error between the generated field and ground truth simulations, a 76.6% higher maximum rate of loss and an increased ability to fool a discriminator network. It is hoped that this loss function will enable accelerated machine learning within computational fluid dynamics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17062">Graph Structure Learning with Bi-level Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, most Graph Structure Learning (GSL) methods, as a means of learning graph structure, improve the robustness of GNN merely from a local view by considering the local information related to each edge and indiscriminately applying the mechanism across edges, which may suffer from the local structure heterogeneity of the graph (\ie the uneven distribution of inter-class connections over nodes). To overcome the cons, we extract the graph structure as a learnable parameter and jointly learn the structure and common parameters of GNN from the global view. Excitingly, the common parameters contain the global information for nodes features mapping, which is also crucial for structure optimization (\ie optimizing the structure relies on global mapping information). Mathematically, we apply a generic structure extractor to abstract the graph structure and transform GNNs in the form of learning structure and common parameters. Then, we model the learning process as a novel bi-level optimization, \ie \textit{Generic Structure Extraction with Bi-level Optimization for Graph Structure Learning (GSEBO)}, which optimizes GNN parameters in the upper level to obtain the global mapping information and graph structure is optimized in the lower level with the global information learned from the upper level. We instantiate the proposed GSEBO on classical GNNs and compare it with the state-of-the-art GSL methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed GSEBO on four real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increasing computation of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising solution to synthesize a compact, substitute graph of the large-scale original graph for efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods predominantly employ classification as the surrogate task for optimization, thus excessively relying on node labels and constraining their utility in label-sparsity scenarios. More critically, this surrogate task tends to overfit class-specific information within the condensed graph, consequently restricting the generalization capabilities of GC for other downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Contrastive Graph Condensation (CTGC), which adopts a self-supervised surrogate task to extract critical, causal information from the original graph and enhance the cross-task generalizability of the condensed graph. Specifically, CTGC employs a dual-branch framework to disentangle the generation of the node attributes and graph structures, where a dedicated structural branch is designed to explicitly encode geometric information through nodes' positional embeddings. By implementing an alternating optimization scheme with contrastive loss terms, CTGC promotes the mutual enhancement of both branches and facilitates high-quality graph generation through the model inversion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTGC excels in handling various downstream tasks with a limited number of labels, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art GC methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinho Chang, Hyungjin Chung, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: As Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has proven effective in conditional diffusion model sampling for improved condition alignment, many applications use a negated CFG term to filter out unwanted features from samples. However, simply negating CFG guidance creates an inverted probability distribution, often distorting samples away from the marginal distribution. Inspired by recent advances in conditional diffusion models for inverse problems, here we present a novel method to enhance negative CFG guidance using contrastive loss. Specifically, our guidance term aligns or repels the denoising direction based on the given condition through contrastive loss, achieving a nearly identical guiding direction to traditional CFG for positive guidance while overcoming the limitations of existing negative guidance methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively removes undesirable concepts while maintaining sample quality across diverse scenarios, from simple class conditions to complex and overlapping text prompts.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17089">Efficient LLM Inference with I/O-Aware Partial KV Cache Recomputation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyi Jiang, Lei Gao, Hossein Entezari Zarch, Murali Annavaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to store intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental computation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for KV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring the entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from activations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe bus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Guo, Grace Y. Yi, Boyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While crowdsourcing has emerged as a practical solution for labeling large datasets, it presents a significant challenge in learning accurate models due to noisy labels from annotators with varying levels of expertise. Existing methods typically estimate the true label posterior, conditioned on the instance and noisy annotations, to infer true labels or adjust loss functions. These estimates, however, often overlook potential misspecification in the true label posterior, which can degrade model performances, especially in high-noise scenarios. To address this issue, we investigate learning from noisy annotations with an estimated true label posterior through the framework of conditional distributionally robust optimization (CDRO). We propose formulating the problem as minimizing the worst-case risk within a distance-based ambiguity set centered around a reference distribution. By examining the strong duality of the formulation, we derive upper bounds for the worst-case risk and develop an analytical solution for the dual robust risk for each data point. This leads to a novel robust pseudo-labeling algorithm that leverages the likelihood ratio test to construct a pseudo-empirical distribution, providing a robust reference probability distribution in CDRO. Moreover, to devise an efficient algorithm for CDRO, we derive a closed-form expression for the empirical robust risk and the optimal Lagrange multiplier of the dual problem, facilitating a principled balance between robustness and model fitting. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuncong Yang, Xiao Han, Yidong Chai, Reza Ebrahimi, Rouzbeh Behnia, Balaji Padmanabhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) grant data subjects the `Right to Be Forgotten' (RTBF) and mandate companies to fulfill data erasure requests from data subjects. However, companies encounter great challenges in complying with the RTBF regulations, particularly when asked to erase specific training data from their well-trained predictive models. While researchers have introduced machine unlearning methods aimed at fast data erasure, these approaches often overlook maintaining model performance (e.g., accuracy), which can lead to financial losses and non-compliance with RTBF obligations. This work develops a holistic machine learning-to-unlearning framework, called Ensemble-based iTerative Information Distillation (ETID), to achieve efficient data erasure while preserving the business value of predictive models. ETID incorporates a new ensemble learning method to build an accurate predictive model that can facilitate handling data erasure requests. ETID also introduces an innovative distillation-based unlearning method tailored to the constructed ensemble model to enable efficient and effective data erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ETID outperforms various state-of-the-art methods and can deliver high-quality unlearned models with efficiency. We also highlight ETID's potential as a crucial tool for fostering a legitimate and thriving market for data and predictive services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Tanveer, Anushka Tiwari, Mushir Akhtar, C. T. Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world applications, class-imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges for machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), particularly in effectively managing imbalance, noise, and outliers. Fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs) address class imbalance by assigning varying fuzzy memberships to samples; however, their sensitivity to imbalanced datasets can lead to inaccurate assessments. The recently developed slack-factor-based FSVM (SFFSVM) improves traditional FSVMs by using slack factors to adjust fuzzy memberships based on misclassification likelihood, thereby rectifying misclassifications induced by the hyperplane obtained via different error cost (DEC). Building on SFFSVM, we propose an improved slack-factor-based FSVM (ISFFSVM) that introduces a novel location parameter. This novel parameter significantly advances the model by constraining the DEC hyperplane's extension, thereby mitigating the risk of misclassifying minority class samples. It ensures that majority class samples with slack factor scores approaching the location threshold are assigned lower fuzzy memberships, which enhances the model's discrimination capability. Extensive experimentation on a diverse array of real-world KEEL datasets demonstrates that the proposed ISFFSVM consistently achieves higher F1-scores, Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) compared to baseline classifiers. Consequently, the introduction of the location parameter, coupled with the slack-factor-based fuzzy membership, enables ISFFSVM to outperform traditional approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by severe class disparity. The code for the proposed model is available at \url{https://github.com/mtanveer1/ISFFSVM}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang-Chau Luong, Thuc Nguyen-Quang, Minh-Triet Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Noisy labels pose a substantial challenge in machine learning, often resulting in overfitting and poor generalization. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), as demonstrated in Foret et al. (2021), improves generalization over traditional Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in classification tasks with noisy labels by implicitly slowing noisy learning. While SAM's ability to generalize in noisy environments has been studied in several simplified settings, its full potential in more realistic training settings remains underexplored. In this work, we analyze SAM's behavior at each iteration, identifying specific components of the gradient vector that contribute significantly to its robustness against noisy labels. Based on these insights, we propose SANER (Sharpness-Aware Noise-Explicit Reweighting), an effective variant that enhances SAM's ability to manage noisy fitting rate. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Mini-WebVision demonstrate that SANER consistently outperforms SAM, achieving up to an 8% increase on CIFAR-100 with 50% label noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Amin Nabian</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet designed to address these challenges.
  X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs custom graphs directly from CAD files by generating uniform point clouds on the surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous, allowing for efficient long-range interactions.
  Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus: github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/examples/cfd/xaeronet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhe Hu, Difan Zou, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have long been criticized for being black-box. To unveil the inner workings of modern neural architectures, a recent work \cite{yu2024white} proposed an information-theoretic objective function called Sparse Rate Reduction (SRR) and interpreted its unrolled optimization as a Transformer-like model called Coding Rate Reduction Transformer (CRATE). However, the focus of the study was primarily on the basic implementation, and whether this objective is optimized in practice and its causal relationship to generalization remain elusive. Going beyond this study, we derive different implementations by analyzing layer-wise behaviors of CRATE, both theoretically and empirically. To reveal the predictive power of SRR on generalization, we collect a set of model variants induced by varied implementations and hyperparameters and evaluate SRR as a complexity measure based on its correlation with generalization. Surprisingly, we find out that SRR has a positive correlation coefficient and outperforms other baseline measures, such as path-norm and sharpness-based ones. Furthermore, we show that generalization can be improved using SRR as regularization on benchmark image classification datasets. We hope this paper can shed light on leveraging SRR to design principled models and study their generalization ability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17201">Learning Hierarchical Polynomials of Multiple Nonlinear Features with Three-Layer Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyu Fu, Zihao Wang, Eshaan Nichani, Jason D. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning theory, a critical question is to understand how neural networks learn hierarchical features. In this work, we study the learning of hierarchical polynomials of \textit{multiple nonlinear features} using three-layer neural networks. We examine a broad class of functions of the form $f^{\star}=g^{\star}\circ \bp$, where $\bp:\mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{r}$ represents multiple quadratic features with $r \ll d$ and $g^{\star}:\mathbb{R}^{r}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of degree $p$. This can be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of the multi-index model \citep{damian2022neural}, and also an expansion upon previous work that focused only on a single nonlinear feature, i.e. $r = 1$ \citep{nichani2023provable,wang2023learning}.
  Our primary contribution shows that a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent suffices for
  \begin{itemize}\item complete recovery of the space spanned by the nonlinear features
  \item efficient learning of the target function $f^{\star}=g^{\star}\circ \bp$ or transfer learning of $f=g\circ \bp$ with a different link function
  \end{itemize} within $\widetilde{\cO}(d^4)$ samples and polynomial time. For such hierarchical targets, our result substantially improves the sample complexity ${\Theta}(d^{2p})$ of the kernel methods, demonstrating the power of efficient feature learning. It is important to highlight that{ our results leverage novel techniques and thus manage to go beyond all prior settings} such as single-index and multi-index models as well as models depending just on one nonlinear feature, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of feature learning in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqi Chen, Zhiqiang Zhou, Qingsong Wen, Liang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series subsequence anomaly detection is an important task in a large variety of real-world applications ranging from health monitoring to AIOps, and is challenging due to the following reasons: 1) how to effectively learn complex dynamics and dependencies in time series; 2) diverse and complicated anomalous subsequences as well as the inherent variance and noise of normal patterns; 3) how to determine the proper subsequence length for effective detection, which is a required parameter for many existing algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel approach to subsequence anomaly detection, namely GraphSubDetector. First, it adaptively learns the appropriate subsequence length with a length selection mechanism that highlights the characteristics of both normal and anomalous patterns. Second, we propose a density-aware adaptive graph neural network (DAGNN), which can generate further robust representations against variance of normal data for anomaly detection by message passing between subsequences. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which achieves superior performance on multiple time series anomaly benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present APT, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM)-driven framework that enables autonomous agents to construct complex and creative structures within the Minecraft environment. Unlike previous approaches that primarily concentrate on skill-based open-world tasks or rely on image-based diffusion models for generating voxel-based structures, our method leverages the intrinsic spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By employing chain-of-thought decomposition along with multimodal inputs, the framework generates detailed architectural layouts and blueprints that the agent can execute under zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios. Our agent incorporates both memory and reflection modules to facilitate lifelong learning, adaptive refinement, and error correction throughout the building process. To rigorously evaluate the agent's performance in this emerging research area, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark consisting of diverse construction tasks designed to test creativity, spatial reasoning, adherence to in-game rules, and the effective integration of multimodal instructions. Experimental results using various GPT-based LLM backends and agent configurations demonstrate the agent's capacity to accurately interpret extensive instructions involving numerous items, their positions, and orientations. The agent successfully produces complex structures complete with internal functionalities such as Redstone-powered systems. A/B testing indicates that the inclusion of a memory module leads to a significant increase in performance, emphasizing its role in enabling continuous learning and the reuse of accumulated experience. Additionally, the agent's unexpected emergence of scaffolding behavior highlights the potential of future LLM-driven agents to utilize subroutine planning and leverage the emergence ability of LLMs to autonomously develop human-like problem-solving techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Industry 5.0 introduces new challenges for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), characterized by high-dimensional, high-resolution data and high-stakes application scenarios. Against this backdrop, developing efficient and interpretable models for LTSF becomes a key challenge. Existing deep learning and linear models often suffer from excessive parameter complexity and lack intuitive interpretability. To address these issues, we propose DiPE-Linear, a Disentangled interpretable Parameter-Efficient Linear network. DiPE-Linear incorporates three temporal components: Static Frequential Attention (SFA), Static Temporal Attention (STA), and Independent Frequential Mapping (IFM). These components alternate between learning in the frequency and time domains to achieve disentangled interpretability. The decomposed model structure reduces parameter complexity from quadratic in fully connected networks (FCs) to linear and computational complexity from quadratic to log-linear. Additionally, a Low-Rank Weight Sharing policy enhances the model's ability to handle multivariate series. Despite operating within a subspace of FCs with limited expressive capacity, DiPE-Linear demonstrates comparable or superior performance to both FCs and nonlinear models across multiple open-source and real-world LTSF datasets, validating the effectiveness of its sophisticatedly designed structure. The combination of efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability makes DiPE-Linear a strong candidate for advancing LTSF in both research and real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: Neural collapse, a newly identified characteristic, describes a property of solutions during model training. In this paper, we explore neural collapse in the context of imbalanced data. We consider the $L$-extended unconstrained feature model with a bias term and provide a theoretical analysis of global minimizer.
  Our findings include: (1) Features within the same class converge to their class mean, similar to both the balanced case and the imbalanced case without bias. (2) The geometric structure is mainly on the left orthonormal transformation of the product of $L$ linear classifiers and the right transformation of the class-mean matrix. (3) Some rows of the left orthonormal transformation of the product of $L$ linear classifiers collapse to zeros and others are orthogonal, which relies on the singular values of $\hat Y=(I_K-1/N\mathbf{n}1^\top_K)D$, where $K$ is class size, $\mathbf{n}$ is the vector of sample size for each class, $D$ is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are given by $\sqrt{\mathbf{n}}$. Similar results are for the columns of the right orthonormal transformation of the product of class-mean matrix and $D$. (4) The $i$-th row of the left orthonormal transformation of the product of $L$ linear classifiers aligns with the $i$-th column of the right orthonormal transformation of the product of class-mean matrix and $D$. (5) We provide the estimation of singular values about $\hat Y$. Our numerical experiments support these theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Capstick, Rahul G. Krishnan, Payam Barnaghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), trained on diverse data effectively acquire a breadth of information across various domains. However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency hinder their direct application for specialised tasks. In fields such as clinical research, acquiring expert annotations or prior knowledge about predictive models is often costly and time-consuming. This study proposes using LLMs to elicit expert prior distributions for predictive models. This approach also provides an alternative to in-context learning, where language models are tasked with making predictions directly. We compare LLM-elicited and uninformative priors, evaluate whether LLMs truthfully generate parameter distributions, and propose a model selection strategy for in-context learning and prior elicitation. Our findings show that LLM-elicited prior parameter distributions significantly reduce predictive error compared to uninformative priors in low-data settings. Applied to clinical problems, this translates to fewer required biological samples, lowering cost and resources. Prior elicitation also consistently outperforms and proves more reliable than in-context learning at a lower cost, making it a preferred alternative in our setting. We demonstrate the utility of this method across various use cases, including clinical applications. For infection prediction, using LLM-elicited priors reduced the number of required labels to achieve the same accuracy as an uninformative prior by 55%, at 200 days earlier in the study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cem Ata Baykara, Ali Burak \"Unal, Nico Pfeifer, Mete Akg\"un</p>
<p>Abstract: In computational biology, predictive models are widely used to address complex tasks, but their performance can suffer greatly when applied to data from different distributions. The current state-of-the-art domain adaptation method for high-dimensional data aims to mitigate these issues by aligning the input dependencies between training and test data. However, this approach requires centralized access to both source and target domain data, raising concerns about data privacy, especially when the data comes from multiple sources. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving federated framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in high-dimensional settings. Our method employs federated training of Gaussian processes and weighted elastic nets to effectively address the problem of distribution shift between domains, while utilizing secure aggregation and randomized encoding to protect the local data of participating data owners. We evaluate our framework on the task of age prediction using DNA methylation data from multiple tissues, demonstrating that our approach performs comparably to existing centralized methods while maintaining data privacy, even in distributed environments where data is spread across multiple institutions. Our framework is the first privacy-preserving solution for high-dimensional domain adaptation in federated environments, offering a promising tool for fields like computational biology and medicine, where protecting sensitive data is essential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Majority subspace clustering (SC) algorithms depend on one or more hyperparameters that need to be carefully tuned for the SC algorithms to achieve high clustering performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is often performed using grid-search, assuming that some labeled data is available. In some domains, such as medicine, this assumption does not hold true in many cases. One avenue of research focuses on developing SC algorithms that are inherently free of hyperparameters. For hyperparameters-dependent SC algorithms, one approach to label-independent HPO tuning is based on internal clustering quality metrics (if available), whose performance should ideally match that of external (label-dependent) clustering quality metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to label-independent HPO that uses clustering quality metrics, such as accuracy (ACC) or normalized mutual information (NMI), that are computed based on pseudo-labels obtained from the SC algorithm across a predefined grid of hyperparameters. Assuming that ACC (or NMI) is a smooth function of hyperparameter values it is possible to select subintervals of hyperparameters. These subintervals are then iteratively further split into halves or thirds until a relative error criterion is satisfied. In principle, the hyperparameters of any SC algorithm can be tuned using the proposed method. We demonstrate this approach on several single- and multi-view SC algorithms, comparing the achieved performance with their oracle versions across six datasets representing digits, faces and objects. The proposed method typically achieves clustering performance that is 5% to 7% lower than that of the oracle versions. We also make our proposed method interpretable by visualizing subspace bases, which are estimated from the computed clustering partitions. This aids in the initial selection of the hyperparameter search space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoguo Ai, Guansong Pang, Hezhe Qiao, Yuan Gao, Hui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in incorporating various graph structure information, e.g., long-range structural dependency, into graph representation learning. However, self-attention -- the core module of GTs -- preserves only low-frequency signals on graph features, retaining only homophilic patterns that capture similar features among the connected nodes. Consequently, it has insufficient capacity in modeling complex node label patterns, such as the opposite of homophilic patterns -- heterophilic patterns. Some improved GTs deal with the problem by learning polynomial filters or performing self-attention over the first-order graph spectrum. However, these GTs either ignore rich information contained in the whole spectrum or neglect higher-order spectrum information, resulting in limited flexibility and frequency response in their spectral filters. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel GT network, namely Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformers (GrokFormer), to go beyond the self-attention in GTs. GrokFormer leverages learnable activation functions in order-$K$ graph spectrum through Fourier series modeling to i) learn eigenvalue-targeted filter functions producing learnable base that can capture a broad range of frequency signals flexibly, and ii) extract first- and higher-order graph spectral information adaptively. In doing so, GrokFormer can effectively capture intricate patterns hidden across different orders and levels of frequency signals, learning expressive, order-and-frequency-adaptive graph representations. Comprehensive experiments conducted on 10 node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and levels of graph heterophily, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, demonstrate that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and other advanced graph neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Garrido-Munoz, Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) have led to significant reductions in transcription errors on standard benchmarks under the i.i.d. assumption, thus focusing on minimizing in-distribution (ID) errors. However, this assumption does not hold in real-world applications, which has motivated HTR research to explore Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation techniques. In this work, we investigate the unaddressed limitations of HTR models in generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We adopt the challenging setting of Domain Generalization, where models are expected to generalize to OOD data without any prior access. To this end, we analyze 336 OOD cases from eight state-of-the-art HTR models across seven widely used datasets, spanning five languages. Additionally, we study how HTR models leverage synthetic data to generalize. We reveal that the most significant factor for generalization lies in the textual divergence between domains, followed by visual divergence. We demonstrate that the error of HTR models in OOD scenarios can be reliably estimated, with discrepancies falling below 10 points in 70\% of cases. We identify the underlying limitations of HTR models, laying the foundation for future research to address this challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientists and engineers use simulators to model empirically observed phenomena. However, tuning the parameters of a simulator to ensure its outputs match observed data presents a significant challenge. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this by enabling Bayesian inference for simulators, identifying parameters that match observed data and align with prior knowledge. Unlike traditional Bayesian inference, SBI only needs access to simulations from the model and does not require evaluations of the likelihood-function. In addition, SBI algorithms do not require gradients through the simulator, allow for massive parallelization of simulations, and can perform inference for different observations without further simulations or training, thereby amortizing inference. Over the past years, we have developed, maintained, and extended $\texttt{sbi}$, a PyTorch-based package that implements Bayesian SBI algorithms based on neural networks. The $\texttt{sbi}$ toolkit implements a wide range of inference methods, neural network architectures, sampling methods, and diagnostic tools. In addition, it provides well-tested default settings but also offers flexibility to fully customize every step of the simulation-based inference workflow. Taken together, the $\texttt{sbi}$ toolkit enables scientists and engineers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods to black-box simulators, opening up new possibilities for aligning simulations with empirically observed data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanchen Bei, Weizhi Chen, Hao Chen, Sheng Zhou, Carl Yang, Jiapei Fan, Longtao Huang, Jiajun Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label node classification is an important yet under-explored domain in graph mining as many real-world nodes belong to multiple categories rather than just a single one. Although a few efforts have been made by utilizing Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) to learn node representations and model correlations between multiple labels in the embedding space, they still suffer from the ambiguous feature and ambiguous topology induced by multiple labels, which reduces the credibility of the messages delivered in graphs and overlooks the label correlations on graph data. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the ambiguity and empower the GCNs for accurate classification. However, this is quite challenging due to the requirement of retaining the distinctiveness of each label while fully harnessing the correlation between labels simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Correlation-aware Graph Convolutional Network (CorGCN) for multi-label node classification. By introducing a novel Correlation-Aware Graph Decomposition module, CorGCN can learn a graph that contains rich label-correlated information for each label. It then employs a Correlation-Enhanced Graph Convolution to model the relationships between labels during message passing to further bolster the classification process. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CorGCN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Salahshour, Amirahmad Shafiee, Mojtaba Tefagh</p>
<p>Abstract: The Lightning Network (LN) has emerged as a second-layer solution to Bitcoin's scalability challenges. The rise of Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) and their specific mechanisms incentivize individuals to join the network for profit-making opportunities. According to the latest statistics, the total value locked within the Lightning Network is approximately \$500 million. Meanwhile, joining the LN with the profit-making incentives presents several obstacles, as it involves solving a complex combinatorial problem that encompasses both discrete and continuous control variables related to node selection and resource allocation, respectively. Current research inadequately captures the critical role of resource allocation and lacks realistic simulations of the LN routing mechanism. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, enhanced by the power of transformers, to address the Joint Combinatorial Node Selection and Resource Allocation (JCNSRA) problem. We have improved upon an existing environment by introducing modules that enhance its routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap with the actual LN routing system and ensuring compatibility with the JCNSRA problem. We compare our model against several baselines and heuristics, demonstrating its superior performance across various settings. Additionally, we address concerns regarding centralization in the LN by deploying our agent within the network and monitoring the centrality measures of the evolved graph. Our findings suggest not only an absence of conflict between LN's decentralization goals and individuals' revenue-maximization incentives but also a positive association between the two.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Zheng, Wei Jiang, Alexander Zhou, Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung, Choujun Zhan, Tong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Among various spatio-temporal prediction tasks, epidemic forecasting plays a critical role in public health management. Recent studies have demonstrated the strong potential of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) in extracting heterogeneous spatio-temporal patterns for epidemic forecasting. However, most of these methods bear an over-simplified assumption that two locations (e.g., cities) with similar observed features in previous time steps will develop similar infection numbers in the future. In fact, for any epidemic disease, there exists strong heterogeneity of its intrinsic evolution mechanisms across geolocation and time, which can eventually lead to diverged infection numbers in two ``similar'' locations. However, such mechanistic heterogeneity is non-trivial to be captured due to the existence of numerous influencing factors like medical resource accessibility, virus mutations, mobility patterns, etc., most of which are spatio-temporal yet unreachable or even unobservable. To address this challenge, we propose a Heterogeneous Epidemic-Aware Transmission Graph Neural Network (HeatGNN), a novel epidemic forecasting framework. By binding the epidemiology mechanistic model into a GNN, HeatGNN learns epidemiology-informed location embeddings of different locations that reflect their own transmission mechanisms over time. With the time-varying mechanistic affinity graphs computed with the epidemiology-informed location embeddings, a heterogeneous transmission graph network is designed to encode the mechanistic heterogeneity among locations, providing additional predictive signals to facilitate accurate forecasting. Experiments on three benchmark datasets have revealed that HeatGNN outperforms various strong baselines. Moreover, our efficiency analysis verifies the real-world practicality of HeatGNN on datasets of different sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Shi, Qianqian Ren, Yong Liu, Jianguo Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in many fields, yet current deep learning models struggle with noise, data sparsity, and capturing complex multi-scale patterns. This paper presents MFF-FTNet, a novel framework addressing these challenges by combining contrastive learning with multi-scale feature extraction across both frequency and time domains. MFF-FTNet introduces an adaptive noise augmentation strategy that adjusts scaling and shifting factors based on the statistical properties of the original time series data, enhancing model resilience to noise. The architecture is built around two complementary modules: a Frequency-Aware Contrastive Module (FACM) that refines spectral representations through frequency selection and contrastive learning, and a Complementary Time Domain Contrastive Module (CTCM) that captures both short- and long-term dependencies using multi-scale convolutions and feature fusion. A unified feature representation strategy enables robust contrastive learning across domains, creating an enriched framework for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that MFF-FTNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a 7.7% MSE improvement on multivariate tasks. These findings underscore MFF-FTNet's effectiveness in modeling complex temporal patterns and managing noise and sparsity, providing a comprehensive solution for both long- and short-term forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwon Kim, Matteo Zecchin, Sangwoo Park, Joonhyuk Kang, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential approach for optimizing black-box objective functions using zeroth-order noisy observations. In BO, Gaussian processes (GPs) are employed as probabilistic surrogate models to estimate the objective function based on past observations, guiding the selection of future queries to maximize utility. However, the performance of BO heavily relies on the quality of these probabilistic estimates, which can deteriorate significantly under model misspecification. To address this issue, we introduce localized online conformal prediction-based Bayesian optimization (LOCBO), a BO algorithm that calibrates the GP model through localized online conformal prediction (CP). LOCBO corrects the GP likelihood based on predictive sets produced by LOCBO, and the corrected GP likelihood is then denoised to obtain a calibrated posterior distribution on the objective function. The likelihood calibration step leverages an input-dependent calibration threshold to tailor coverage guarantees to different regions of the input space. Under minimal noise assumptions, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for LOCBO's iterates that hold for the unobserved objective function. These theoretical findings are validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, demonstrating that LOCBO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art BO algorithms in the presence of model misspecification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanxu Meng, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: To adapt a well-trained large model to downstream tasks, we propose constraining learning within its original latent space by leveraging linear combinations of its basis vectors. This approach ensures stable training without compromising the model's capabilities. Traditionally, constructing orthonormal bases from a matrix requires a transfer matrix, which significantly increases storage and computational overhead for parameters and feature maps. In this paper, we introduce Absorb and Decompose for Q, K, V, and O matrices, enabling their orthogonalization without the need for transfer matrices. Furthermore, the Absorb-Decompose operation eliminates redundant vectors, reducing the encoder attention parameters of Whisper-large-v3 by 46.42% without requiring additional training. For parameter-efficient and stable fine-tuning, we orthonormalized Q, K, V, and O and fine-tuned only the singular values, allowing efficient adaptation while constraining changes to the original latent space. When fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B on eight commonsense reasoning datasets, our method outperforms LoRA by 5.4% and DoRA by 4.4%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Attali, Davide Buscaldi, Nathalie Pernelle</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, but their effectiveness is often constrained by two critical challenges: oversquashing, where the excessive compression of information from distant nodes results in significant information loss, and oversmoothing, where repeated message-passing iterations homogenize node representations, obscuring meaningful distinctions. These issues, intrinsically linked to the underlying graph structure, hinder information flow and constrain the expressiveness of GNNs. In this survey, we examine graph rewiring techniques, a class of methods designed to address these structural bottlenecks by modifying graph topology to enhance information diffusion. We provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art rewiring approaches, delving into their theoretical underpinnings, practical implementations, and performance trade-offs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Active Learning aims to optimize performance while minimizing annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples from an unlabelled pool. Traditional uncertainty sampling often leads to sampling bias by choosing similar uncertain samples. We propose an active learning method that utilizes fixed equiangular hyperspherical points as class prototypes, ensuring consistent inter-class separation and robust feature representations. Our approach introduces Maximally Separated Active Learning (MSAL) for uncertainty sampling and a combined strategy (MSAL-D) for incorporating diversity. This method eliminates the need for costly clustering steps, while maintaining diversity through hyperspherical uniformity. We demonstrate strong performance over existing active learning techniques across five benchmark datasets, highlighting the method's effectiveness and integration ease.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joris Bekkers, Amod Sahasrabudhe</p>
<p>Abstract: A counterattack in soccer is a high speed, high intensity direct attack that can occur when a team transitions from a defensive state to an attacking state after regaining possession of the ball. The aim is to create a goal-scoring opportunity by convering a lot of ground with minimal passes before the opposing team can recover their defensive shape. The purpose of this research is to build gender-specific Graph Neural Networks to model the likelihood of a counterattack being successful and uncover what factors make them successful in professional soccer. These models are trained on a total of 20863 frames of synchronized on-ball event and spatiotemporal (broadcast) tracking data. This dataset is derived from 632 games of MLS (2022), NWSL (2022) and international soccer (2020-2022). With this data we demonstrate that gender-specific Graph Neural Networks outperform architecturally identical gender-ambiguous models in predicting the successful outcome of counterattacks. We show, using Permutation Feature Importance, that byline to byline speed, angle to the goal, angle to the ball and sideline to sideline speed are the node features with the highest impact on model performance.
  Additionally, we offer some illustrative examples on how to navigate the infinite solution search space to aid in identifying improvements for player decision making.
  This research is accompanied by an open-source repository containing all data and code, and it is also accompanied by an open-source Python package which simplifies converting spatiotemporal data into graphs. This package also facilitates testing, validation, training and prediction with this data. This should allow the reader to replicate and improve upon our research more easily.</p>

<p>Abstract: The centralization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses significant challenges, including single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. These problems are especially prevalent in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used without transparency. To mitigate these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has emerged as a promising solution. DeAI combines the strengths of both blockchain and AI technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, and trustworthiness of AI systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art DeAI development, particularly for active industry solutions, is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. We analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigating how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, while also ensuring fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we identify key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols, highlighting several critical avenues for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance model interpretability by introducing human-understandable concepts within the architecture. However, existing CBMs assume static datasets, limiting their ability to adapt to real-world, continuously evolving data streams. To address this, we define a novel concept-incremental and class-incremental continual learning task for CBMs, enabling models to accumulate new concepts and classes over time while retaining previously learned knowledge. To achieve this, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a framework that prevents catastrophic forgetting by reformulating concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems, thus eliminating the need for gradient-based updates. CONCIL requires only recursive matrix operations, making it computationally efficient and suitable for real-time and large-scale data applications. Experimental results demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and outperforms traditional CBM methods in concept- and class-incremental settings, establishing a new benchmark for continual learning in CBMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mojtaba A. Farahani, Fadi El Kalach, Austin Harper, M. R. McCormick, Ramy Harik, Thorsten Wuest</p>
<p>Abstract: TSF is growing in various domains including manufacturing. Although numerous TSF algorithms have been developed recently, the validation and evaluation of algorithms hold substantial value for researchers and practitioners and are missing. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the SoTA TSF algorithms on thirteen manufacturing datasets, focusing on their applicability in manufacturing. Each algorithm was selected based on its TSF category to ensure a representative set of algorithms. The evaluation includes different scenarios to evaluate the models using two problem categories and two forecasting horizons. To evaluate the performance, the WAPE was calculated, and additional post hoc analyses were conducted to assess the significance of observed differences. Only algorithms with codes from open-source libraries were utilized, and no hyperparameter tuning was done. This allowed us to evaluate the algorithms as "out-of-the-box" solutions that can be easily implemented, ensuring their usability within the manufacturing by practitioners with limited technical knowledge. This aligns to facilitate the adoption of these techniques in smart manufacturing systems. Based on the results, transformer and MLP-based architectures demonstrated the best performance with MLP-based architecture winning the most scenarios. For univariate TSF, PatchTST emerged as the most robust, particularly for long-term horizons, while for multivariate problems, MLP-based architectures like N-HITS and TiDE showed superior results. The study revealed that simpler algorithms like XGBoost could outperform complex algorithms in certain tasks. These findings challenge the assumption that more sophisticated models produce better results. Additionally, the research highlighted the importance of computational resource considerations, showing variations in runtime and memory usage across different algorithms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17501">Inference Scaling $\scriptsize\mathtt{F}$Laws: The Limits of LLM Resampling with Imperfect Verifiers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Stroebl, Sayash Kapoor, Arvind Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has generated hope that inference scaling could allow weaker language models to match or exceed the accuracy of stronger models, such as by repeatedly sampling solutions to a coding problem until it passes unit tests. The central thesis of this paper is that there is no free lunch for inference scaling: indefinite accuracy improvement through resampling can only be realized if the "verifier" (in this case, a set of unit tests) is perfect. When the verifier is imperfect, as it almost always is in domains such as reasoning or coding (for example, unit tests have imperfect coverage), there is a nonzero probability of false positives: incorrect solutions that pass the verifier. Resampling cannot decrease this probability, so it imposes an upper bound to the accuracy of resampling-based inference scaling even with an infinite compute budget. We find that there is a very strong correlation between the model's single-sample accuracy (i.e. accuracy without unit tests) and its false positive rate on coding benchmarks HumanEval and MBPP, whose unit tests have limited coverage. Therefore, no amount of inference scaling of weaker models can enable them to match the single-sample accuracy of a sufficiently strong model (Fig. 1a). When we consider that false positives have a negative utility compared to abstaining from producing a solution, it bends the inference scaling curve further downward. Empirically, we find that the optimal number of samples can be less than 10 under realistic assumptions (Fig. 1b). Finally, we show that beyond accuracy, false positives may have other undesirable qualities, such as poor adherence to coding style conventions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study develops a deep learning-based approach to automate inbound load plan adjustments for a large transportation and logistics company. It addresses a critical challenge for the efficient and resilient planning of E-commerce operations in presence of increasing uncertainties. The paper introduces an innovative data-driven approach to inbound load planning. Leveraging extensive historical data, the paper presents a two-stage decision-making process using deep learning and conformal prediction to provide scalable, accurate, and confidence-aware solutions. The first stage of the prediction is dedicated to tactical load-planning, while the second stage is dedicated to the operational planning, incorporating the latest available data to refine the decisions at the finest granularity. Extensive experiments compare traditional machine learning models and deep learning methods. They highlight the importance and effectiveness of the embedding layers for enhancing the performance of deep learning models. Furthermore, the results emphasize the efficacy of conformal prediction to provide confidence-aware prediction sets. The findings suggest that data-driven methods can substantially improve decision making in inbound load planning, offering planners a comprehensive, trustworthy, and real-time framework to make decisions.

The first approach involves using a physical UR5e robotic arm to reproduce a signature while capturing those parameters over time. The second method, a cost effective approach, uses a neural network to estimate the same parameters. Our findings demonstrate that a simple neural network model can extract effective parameters for signature verification. Training the neural network with the MCYT300 dataset and cross validating with other databases, namely, BiosecurID, Visual, Blind, OnOffSigDevanagari 75 and OnOffSigBengali 75 confirm the models generalization capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atamert Rahma, Chinmay Datar, Felix Dietrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks that synergistically integrate data and physical laws offer great promise in modeling dynamical systems. However, iterative gradient-based optimization of network parameters is often computationally expensive and suffers from slow convergence. In this work, we present a backpropagation-free algorithm to accelerate the training of neural networks for approximating Hamiltonian systems through data-agnostic and data-driven algorithms. We empirically show that data-driven sampling of the network parameters outperforms data-agnostic sampling or the traditional gradient-based iterative optimization of the network parameters when approximating functions with steep gradients or wide input domains. We demonstrate that our approach is more than 100 times faster with CPUs than the traditionally trained Hamiltonian Neural Networks using gradient-based iterative optimization and is more than four orders of magnitude accurate in chaotic examples, including the H\'enon-Heiles system.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17525">Pushing the Limits of Large Language Model Quantization via the Linearity Theorem</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vladimir Malinovskii, Andrei Panferov, Ivan Ilin, Han Guo, Peter Richt\'arik, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantizing large language models has become a standard way to reduce their memory and computational costs. Typically, existing methods focus on breaking down the problem into individual layer-wise sub-problems, and minimizing per-layer error, measured via various metrics. Yet, this approach currently lacks theoretical justification and the metrics employed may be sub-optimal. In this paper, we present a "linearity theorem" establishing a direct relationship between the layer-wise $\ell_2$ reconstruction error and the model perplexity increase due to quantization. This insight enables two novel applications: (1) a simple data-free LLM quantization method using Hadamard rotations and MSE-optimal grids, dubbed HIGGS, which outperforms all prior data-free approaches such as the extremely popular NF4 quantized format, and (2) an optimal solution to the problem of finding non-uniform per-layer quantization levels which match a given compression constraint in the medium-bitwidth regime, obtained by reduction to dynamic programming. On the practical side, we demonstrate improved accuracy-compression trade-offs on Llama-3.1 and 3.2-family models, as well as on Qwen-family models. Further, we show that our method can be efficiently supported in terms of GPU kernels at various batch sizes, advancing both data-free and non-uniform quantization for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kutalm{\i}\c{s} Co\c{s}kun, Borahan T\"umer, Bjarne C. Hiller, Martin Becker</p>
<p>Abstract: Markov chains are simple yet powerful mathematical structures to model temporally dependent processes. They generally assume stationary data, i.e., fixed transition probabilities between observations/states. However, live, real-world processes, like in the context of activity tracking, biological time series, or industrial monitoring, often switch behavior over time. Such behavior switches can be modeled as transitions between higher-level \emph{modes} (e.g., running, walking, etc.). Yet all modes are usually not previously known, often exhibit vastly differing transition probabilities, and can switch unpredictably. Thus, to track behavior changes of live, real-world processes, this study proposes an online and efficient method to construct Evolving Markov chains (EMCs). EMCs adaptively track transition probabilities, automatically discover modes, and detect mode switches in an online manner. In contrast to previous work, EMCs are of arbitrary order, the proposed update scheme does not rely on tracking windows, only updates the relevant region of the probability tensor, and enjoys geometric convergence of the expected estimates. Our evaluation of synthetic data and real-world applications on human activity recognition, electric motor condition monitoring, and eye-state recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements illustrates the versatility of the approach and points to the potential of EMCs to efficiently track, model, and understand live, real-world processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Wang, Hao Yin, Yifan Yang, Chenyang Zhao, Siqin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Freight truck-related crashes pose significant challenges, leading to substantial economic losses, injuries, and fatalities, with pronounced spatial disparities across different regions. This study adopts a transport geography perspective to examine spatial justice concerns by employing deep counterfactual inference models to analyze how socioeconomic disparities, road infrastructure, and environmental conditions influence the geographical distribution and severity of freight truck crashes. By integrating road network datasets, socioeconomic attributes, and crash records from the Los Angeles metropolitan area, this research provides a nuanced spatial analysis of how different communities are disproportionately impacted. The results reveal significant spatial disparities in crash severity across areas with varying population densities, income levels, and minority populations, highlighting the pivotal role of infrastructural and environmental improvements in mitigating these disparities. The findings offer insights into targeted, location-specific policy interventions, suggesting enhancements in road infrastructure, lighting, and traffic control systems, particularly in low-income and minority-concentrated areas. This research contributes to the literature on transport geography and spatial equity by providing data-driven insights into effective measures for reducing spatial injustices associated with freight truck-related crashes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Wang, Qing Yu, Yancun Song, Quan Yuan, Chao Yang, Chengcheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Bike-sharing is an environmentally friendly shared mobility mode, but its self-loop phenomenon, where bikes are returned to the same station after several time usage, significantly impacts equity in accessing its services. Therefore, this study conducts a multiscale analysis with a spatial autoregressive model and double machine learning framework to assess socioeconomic features and geospatial location's impact on the self-loop phenomenon at metro stations and street scales. The results reveal that bike-sharing self-loop intensity exhibits significant spatial lag effect at street scale and is positively associated with residential land use. Marginal treatment effects of residential land use is higher on streets with middle-aged residents, high fixed employment, and low car ownership. The multimodal public transit condition reveals significant positive marginal treatment effects at both scales. To enhance bike-sharing cooperation, we advocate augmenting bicycle availability in areas with high metro usage and low bus coverage, alongside implementing adaptable redistribution strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes O. Ferstad, Emily B. Fox, David Scheinker, Ramesh Johari</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital health interventions (DHIs) and remote patient monitoring (RPM) have shown great potential in improving chronic disease management through personalized care. However, barriers like limited efficacy and workload concerns hinder adoption of existing DHIs; while limited sample sizes and lack of interpretability limit the effectiveness and adoption of purely black-box algorithmic DHIs. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing a pipeline for learning explainable treatment policies for RPM-enabled DHIs. We apply our approach in the real-world setting of RPM using a DHI to improve glycemic control of youth with type 1 diabetes. Our main contribution is to reveal the importance of clinical domain knowledge in developing state and action representations for effective, efficient, and interpretable targeting policies. We observe that policies learned from clinician-informed representations are significantly more efficacious and efficient than policies learned from black-box representations. This work emphasizes the importance of collaboration between ML researchers and clinicians for developing effective DHIs in the real world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cynthia Dwork, Chris Hays, Nicole Immorlica, Juan C. Perdomo, Pranay Tankala</p>
<p>Abstract: Professional networks provide invaluable entree to opportunity through referrals and introductions. A rich literature shows they also serve to entrench and even exacerbate a status quo of privilege and disadvantage. Hiring platforms, equipped with the ability to nudge link formation, provide a tantalizing opening for beneficial structural change. We anticipate that key to this prospect will be the ability to estimate the likelihood of edge formation in an evolving graph. Outcome-indistinguishable prediction algorithms ensure that the modeled world is indistinguishable from the real world by a family of statistical tests. Omnipredictors ensure that predictions can be post-processed to yield loss minimization competitive with respect to a benchmark class of predictors for many losses simultaneously, with appropriate post-processing. We begin by observing that, by combining a slightly modified form of the online K29 star algorithm of Vovk (2007) with basic facts from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, one can derive simple and efficient online algorithms satisfying outcome indistinguishability and omniprediction, with guarantees that improve upon, or are complementary to, those currently known. This is of independent interest. We apply these techniques to evolving graphs, obtaining online outcome-indistinguishable omnipredictors for rich -- possibly infinite -- sets of distinguishers that capture properties of pairs of nodes, and their neighborhoods. This yields, inter alia, multicalibrated predictions of edge formation with respect to pairs of demographic groups, and the ability to simultaneously optimize loss as measured by a variety of social welfare functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyi Jin, Lu Chen, Hongru Ding, Meijie Wang, Lun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity and cost of clinical trials, particularly in the context of oncology and advanced therapies, pose significant challenges for drug development. This study evaluates the predictive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and HINT in determining clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging a curated dataset of trials from ClinicalTrials.gov, we compare the models' performance using metrics including balanced accuracy, specificity, recall, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Results indicate that GPT-4o demonstrates robust performance in early trial phases, achieving high recall but facing limitations in specificity. Conversely, the HINT model excels in recognizing negative outcomes, particularly in later trial phases, offering a balanced approach across diverse endpoints. Oncology trials, characterized by high complexity, remain challenging for all models. Additionally, trial duration and disease categories influence predictive performance, with longer durations and complex diseases such as neoplasms reducing accuracy. This study highlights the complementary strengths of LLMs and HINT, providing insights into optimizing predictive tools for clinical trial design and risk management. Future advancements in LLMs are essential to address current gaps in handling negative outcomes and complex domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantifying forest carbon is crucial for informing decisions and policies that will protect the planet. Machine learning (ML) and remote sensing (RS) techniques have been used to do this task more effectively, yet there lacks a systematic review on the most recent ML methods and RS combinations, especially with the consideration of forest characteristics. This study systematically analyzed 25 papers meeting strict inclusion criteria from over 80 related studies, identifying 28 ML methods and key combinations of RS data. Random Forest had the most frequent appearance (88\% of studies), while Extreme Gradient Boosting showed superior performance in 75\% of the studies in which it was compared with other methods. Sentinel-1 emerged as the most utilized remote sensing source, with multi-sensor approaches (e.g., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and LiDAR) proving especially effective. Our findings provide grounds for recommending best practices in integrating machine learning and remote sensing for accurate and scalable forest carbon stock estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaipeng Zeng, Xianbin Liu, Yu Zhang, Xiaokang Yang, Yaohui Jin, Yanyan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Organic synthesis stands as a cornerstone of chemical industry. The development of robust machine learning models to support tasks associated with organic reactions is of significant interest. However, current methods rely on hand-crafted features or direct adaptations of model architectures from other domains, which lacks feasibility as data scales increase or overlook the rich chemical information inherent in reactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces {\modelname}, a novel chemical reaction representation learning model tailored for a variety of organic-reaction-related tasks. By integrating atomic correspondence between reactants and products, our model discerns the molecular transformations that occur during the reaction, thereby enhancing the comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have designed an adapter structure to incorporate reaction conditions into the chemical reaction representation, allowing the model to handle diverse reaction conditions and adapt to various datasets and downstream tasks, e.g., reaction performance prediction. Additionally, we introduce a reaction-center aware attention mechanism that enables the model to concentrate on key functional groups, thereby generating potent representations for chemical reactions. Our model has been evaluated on a range of downstream tasks, including reaction condition prediction, reaction yield prediction, and reaction selectivity prediction. Experimental results indicate that our model markedly outperforms existing chemical reaction representation learning architectures across all tasks. Notably, our model significantly outperforms all the baselines with up to 25\% (top-1) and 16\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline on USPTO\_CONDITION dataset for reaction condition prediction. We plan to open-source the code contingent upon the acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Dai, Brian Sullivan, Axel Montout, Amy Dillon, Chris Waller, Peter Acs, Rachel Denholm, Philip Williams, Alastair D Hay, Raul Santos-Rodriguez, Andrew Dowsey</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of machine learning and AI on electronic health records (EHRs) holds substantial potential for clinical insight. However, this approach faces significant challenges due to data heterogeneity, sparsity, temporal misalignment, and limited labeled outcomes. In this context, we leverage a linked EHR dataset of approximately one million de-identified individuals from Bristol, North Somerset, and South Gloucestershire, UK, to characterize urinary tract infections (UTIs) and develop predictive models focused on data quality, fairness and transparency. A comprehensive data pre-processing and curation pipeline transforms the raw EHR data into a structured format suitable for AI modeling. Given the limited availability and biases of ground truth UTI outcomes, we introduce a UTI risk estimation framework informed by clinical expertise to estimate UTI risk across individual patient timelines. Using this framework, we built pairwise XGBoost models to differentiate UTI risk categories with explainable AI techniques to identify key predictors while ensuring interpretability. Our findings reveal differences in clinical and demographic factors across risk groups, offering insights into UTI risk stratification and progression. This study demonstrates the added value of AI-driven insights into UTI clinical decision-making while prioritizing interpretability, transparency, and fairness, underscoring the importance of sound data practices in advancing health outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Kang, Jun Yu Chen, Zoe Lee-Youngzie, Shuhao Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic detection of depression is a rapidly growing field of research at the intersection of psychology and machine learning. However, with its exponential interest comes a growing concern for data privacy and scarcity due to the sensitivity of such a topic. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data to improve the performance of depression prediction models. Starting from unstructured, naturalistic text data from recorded transcripts of clinical interviews, we utilize an open-source LLM to generate synthetic data through chain-of-thought prompting. This pipeline involves two key steps: the first step is the generation of the synopsis and sentiment analysis based on the original transcript and depression score, while the second is the generation of the synthetic synopsis/sentiment analysis based on the summaries generated in the first step and a new depression score. Not only was the synthetic data satisfactory in terms of fidelity and privacy-preserving metrics, it also balanced the distribution of severity in the training dataset, thereby significantly enhancing the model's capability in predicting the intensity of the patient's depression. By leveraging LLMs to generate synthetic data that can be augmented to limited and imbalanced real-world datasets, we demonstrate a novel approach to addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns commonly faced in automatic depression detection, all while maintaining the statistical integrity of the original dataset. This approach offers a robust framework for future mental health research and applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazheng Li, Jundong Li, Chuxu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks stand as the predominant technique for graph representation learning owing to their strong expressive power, yet the performance highly depends on the availability of high-quality labels in an end-to-end manner. Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been proposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the pretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt learning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with minimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the current exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on learning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the diverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming to generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process involves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight architecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and employing the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings showcase the superior performance of IA-GPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Akhauri, Safeen Huda, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah</p>
<p>Abstract: When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Ouyang, Tao Ge, Thomas Hartvigsen, Zhisong Zhang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We reveal that low-bit quantization favors undertrained large language models (LLMs) by observing that models with larger sizes or fewer training tokens experience less quantization-induced degradation (QiD) when applying low-bit quantization, whereas smaller models with extensive training tokens suffer significant QiD. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500 quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors such as the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.
  With the derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with 100 trillion tokens. Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over 100 trillion tokens, may NOT be desirable. This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research. To facilitate future research on this problem, we release all the 1500+ quantized checkpoints used in this work at https://huggingface.co/Xu-Ouyang.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darshan Thaker, Abhishek Goyal, Ren\'e Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nature creates diverse proteins through a `divide and assembly' strategy. Inspired by this idea, we introduce ProteinWeaver, a two-stage framework for protein backbone design. Our method first generates individual protein domains and then employs an SE(3) diffusion model to flexibly assemble these domains. A key challenge lies in the assembling step, given the complex and rugged nature of the inter-domain interaction landscape. To address this challenge, we employ preference alignment to discern complex relationships between structure and interaction landscapes through comparative analysis of generated samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ProteinWeaver: (1) generates high-quality, novel protein backbones through versatile domain assembly; (2) outperforms RFdiffusion, the current state-of-the-art in backbone design, by 13\% and 39\% for long-chain proteins; (3) shows the potential for cooperative function design through illustrative case studies. To sum up, by introducing a `divide-and-assembly' paradigm, ProteinWeaver advances protein engineering and opens new avenues for functional protein design.</p>

Specifically, the parameters calibrated include the latent heat of sublimation and a chemical reaction temperature exponent. Two surrogate models, a Gaussian Process (GP) and a Hierarchical Multiscale Surrogate (HMS) were constructed using an ensemble of 64 simulations generated via Latin Hypercube sampling. Both models exhibited comparable performance during cross-validation. However, the HMS was more stable due to its ability to handle multiscale effects, in contrast with the GP which was very sensitive to kernel choice. Analysis revealed that the surrogates do not accurately predict all spatial locations of the slab burner as-is. Subsequent Bayesian calibration of the physical parameters against experimental observations resulted in regression rate predictions that closer align with experimental observation in specific regions. This study highlights the importance of surrogate model selection and parameter calibration in quantifying uncertainty in predictions of fuel regression rates in complex combustion systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osvaldo M Velarde, Lucas C Parra</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional computer vision models rely on very deep, feedforward networks processing whole images and trained offline with extensive labeled data. In contrast, biological vision relies on comparatively shallow, recurrent networks that analyze sequences of fixated image patches, learning continuously in real-time without explicit supervision. This work introduces a vision network inspired by these biological principles. Specifically, it leverages a joint embedding predictive architecture incorporating recurrent gated circuits. The network learns by predicting the representation of the next image patch (fixation) based on the sequence of past fixations, a form of self-supervised learning. We show mathematical and empirically that the training algorithm avoids the problem of representational collapse. We also introduce \emph{Recurrent-Forward Propagation}, a learning algorithm that avoids biologically unrealistic backpropagation through time or memory-inefficient real-time recurrent learning. We show mathematically that the algorithm implements exact gradient descent for a large class of recurrent architectures, and confirm empirically that it learns efficiently. This paper focuses on these theoretical innovations and leaves empirical evaluation of performance in downstream tasks, and analysis of representational similarity with biological vision for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aycan Deniz Vit, Ujal Rzayev, Bahrem Serhat Danis, Ali Najjar Amiri, Kazim Gorgulu, Emir Salih Magden</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel design paradigm for arbitrarily capable deep photonic networks of cascaded Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) for on-chip universal polarization handling. Using a device architecture made of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we modify and train the phase difference between interferometer arms for both polarizations through wide operation bandwidths. Three proof-of-concept polarization handling devices are illustrated using a software-defined, physics-informed neural framework, to achieve user-specified target device responses as functions of polarization and wavelength. These devices include a polarization splitter, a polarization-independent power splitter, and an arbitrary polarization-dependent splitter to illustrate the capabilities of the design framework. The performance for all three devices is optimized using transfer matrix calculations; and their final responses are verified through 3D-FDTD simulations. All devices demonstrate state-of-the-art performance metrics with over 20 dB extinction, and flat-top transmission bands through bandwidths of 120 nm. In addition to the functional diversity enabled, the optimization for each device is completed in under a minute, highlighting the computational efficiency of the design paradigm presented. These results demonstrate the versatility of the deep photonic network design ecosystem in polarization management, unveiling promising prospects for advanced on-chip applications in optical communications, sensing, and computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasilis Michalakopoulos, Elissaios Sarmas, Viktor Daropoulos, Giannis Kazdaridis, Stratos Keranidis, Vangelis Marinakis, Dimitris Askounis</p>
<p>Abstract: Central to achieving the energy transition, heating systems provide essential space heating and hot water in residential and industrial environments. A major challenge lies in effectively profiling large clusters of buildings to improve demand estimation and enable efficient Demand Response (DR) schemes. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing an unsupervised machine learning framework for clustering residential heating load profiles, focusing on natural gas space heating and hot water preparation boilers. The profiles are analyzed across five dimensions: boiler usage, heating demand, weather conditions, building characteristics, and user behavior. We apply three distance metrics: Euclidean Distance (ED), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and Derivative Dynamic Time Warping (DDTW), and evaluate their performance using established clustering indices. The proposed method is assessed considering 29 residential buildings in Greece equipped with smart meters throughout a calendar heating season (i.e., 210 days). Results indicate that DTW is the most suitable metric, uncovering strong correlations between boiler usage, heat demand, and temperature, while ED highlights broader interrelations across dimensions and DDTW proves less effective, resulting in weaker clusters. These findings offer key insights into heating load behavior, establishing a solid foundation for developing more targeted and effective DR programs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salma Afifi, Ishan Thakkar, Sudeep Pasricha</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of deep learning has revolutionized computing hardware, driving innovations to improve computationally expensive multiply-and-accumulate operations in deep neural networks. Among these innovations are integrated silicon-photonic systems that have emerged as energy-efficient platforms capable of achieving light speed computation and communication, positioning optical neural network (ONN) platforms as a transformative technology for accelerating deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the increasing complexity of optical hardware introduces new vulnerabilities, notably the risk of hardware trojan (HT) attacks. Despite the growing interest in ONN platforms, little attention has been given to how HT-induced threats can compromise performance and security. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of such attacks on the performance of CNN models accelerated by ONN accelerators. Specifically, we show how HTs can compromise microring resonators (MRs) in a state-of-the-art non-coherent ONN accelerator and reduce classification accuracy across CNN models by up to 7.49% to 80.46% by just targeting 10% of MRs. We then propose techniques to enhance ONN accelerator robustness against these attacks and show how the best techniques can effectively recover the accuracy drops.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely popular and effective for image classification tasks but tend to be overly confident in their predictions. Various works have sought to quantify uncertainty associated with these models, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, or identify anomalous regions in an image, but limited work has sought to develop a holistic approach that can accurately estimate perception model confidence across various sources of uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method and compare it to existing approaches for uncertainty quantification and OOD detection. We find that our method can best distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD samples with anomalous regions, as well as between samples with visual image modifications resulting in high, medium, and low prediction accuracy. We describe how to extend our approach for anomaly localization tasks and demonstrate the ability of our approach to distinguish between regions in an image that are familiar to the perception model from those that are unfamiliar. We find that our method generates interpretable scores that most reliably capture a holistic notion of perception model confidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Hu, Oula Puonti, Juan Eugenio Iglesias, Bruce Fischl, Yael Balbastre</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain randomization through synthesis is a powerful strategy to train networks that are unbiased with respect to the domain of the input images. Randomization allows networks to see a virtually infinite range of intensities and artifacts during training, thereby minimizing overfitting to appearance and maximizing generalization to unseen data. While powerful, this approach relies on the accurate tuning of a large set of hyper-parameters governing the probabilistic distribution of the synthesized images. Instead of manually tuning these parameters, we introduce Learn2Synth, a novel procedure in which synthesis parameters are learned using a small set of real labeled data. Unlike methods that impose constraints to align synthetic data with real data (e.g., contrastive or adversarial techniques), which risk misaligning the image and its label map, we tune an augmentation engine such that a segmentation network trained on synthetic data has optimal accuracy when applied to real data. This approach allows the training procedure to benefit from real labeled examples, without ever using these real examples to train the segmentation network, which avoids biasing the network towards the properties of the training set. Specifically, we develop both parametric and nonparametric strategies to augment the synthetic images, enhancing the segmentation network's performance. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning strategy. Code is available at: https://github.com/HuXiaoling/Learn2Synth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubhav Jain, Yuya Kobayashi, Takashi Shibuya, Yuhta Takida, Nasir Memon, Julian Togelius, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are prone to exactly reproduce images from the training data. This exact reproduction of the training data is concerning as it can lead to copyright infringement and/or leakage of privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel way to understand the memorization phenomenon, and propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate it. We argue that memorization occurs because of an attraction basin in the denoising process which steers the diffusion trajectory towards a memorized image. However, this can be mitigated by guiding the diffusion trajectory away from the attraction basin by not applying classifier-free guidance until an ideal transition point occurs from which classifier-free guidance is applied. This leads to the generation of non-memorized images that are high in image quality and well-aligned with the conditioning mechanism. To further improve on this, we present a new guidance technique, \emph{opposite guidance}, that escapes the attraction basin sooner in the denoising process. We demonstrate the existence of attraction basins in various scenarios in which memorization occurs, and we show that our proposed approach successfully mitigates memorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Yin, Jingyang Zhang, Jingwei Sun, Minghong Fang, Hai Li, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging is an emerging technique that integrates multiple models fine-tuned on different tasks to create a versatile model that excels in multiple domains. This scheme, in the meantime, may open up backdoor attack opportunities where one single malicious model can jeopardize the integrity of the merged model. Existing works try to demonstrate the risk of such attacks by assuming substantial computational resources, focusing on cases where the attacker can fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. Such an assumption, however, may not be feasible given the increasing size of machine learning models. In practice where resources are limited and the attacker can only employ techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to produce the malicious model, it remains unclear whether the attack can still work and pose threats. In this work, we first identify that the attack efficacy is significantly diminished when using LoRA for fine-tuning. Then, we propose LoBAM, a method that yields high attack success rate with minimal training resources. The key idea of LoBAM is to amplify the malicious weights in an intelligent way that effectively enhances the attack efficacy. We demonstrate that our design can lead to improved attack success rate through both theoretical proof and extensive empirical experiments across various model merging scenarios. Moreover, we show that our method has strong stealthiness and is difficult to detect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyao Zeng, Jingcheng Ni, Daniel Wang, Patrick Rim, Younjoon Chung, Fengyu Yang, Byung-Woo Hong, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the potential of leveraging language priors learned by text-to-image diffusion models to address ambiguity and visual nuisance in monocular depth estimation. Particularly, traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity due to the absence of stereo or multi-view depth cues, and nuisance due to lack of robustness of vision. We argue that language prior in diffusion models can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the geometric prior aligned with the language description, which is learned during text-to-image pre-training. To generate images that reflect the text properly, the model must comprehend the size and shape of specified objects, their spatial relationship, and the scale of the scene. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both image and text description that aligned with the scene to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language priors can guide the model's attention to specific regions and help it perceive the 3D scene in alignment with user intent. Simultaneously, it acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of the diffusion trajectory, since learning 3D properties from a condensed, low-dimensional language feature is more efficient compared with learning from a redundant, high-dimensional image feature. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and a faster convergence speed, compared with other diffusion-based depth estimators, across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Phishing is one of the most effective ways in which cybercriminals get sensitive details such as credentials for online banking, digital wallets, state secrets, and many more from potential victims. They do this by spamming users with malicious URLs with the sole purpose of tricking them into divulging sensitive information which is later used for various cybercrimes. In this research, we did a comprehensive review of current state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning phishing detection techniques to expose their vulnerabilities and future research direction. For better analysis and observation, we split machine learning techniques into Bayesian, non-Bayesian, and deep learning. We reviewed the most recent advances in Bayesian and non-Bayesian-based classifiers before exploiting their corresponding weaknesses to indicate future research direction. While exploiting weaknesses in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian classifiers, we also compared each performance with a deep learning classifier. For a proper review of deep learning-based classifiers, we looked at Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). We did an empirical analysis to evaluate the performance of each classifier along with many of the proposed state-of-the-art anti-phishing techniques to identify future research directions, we also made a series of proposals on how the performance of the under-performing algorithm can improved in addition to a two-stage prediction model</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faridoun Mehri (Sharif University of Technology), Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah (Sharif University of Technology), Mohammad Taher Pilehvar (Cardiff University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Why do gradient-based explanations struggle with Transformers, and how can we improve them? We identify gradient flow imbalances in Transformers that violate FullGrad-completeness, a critical property for attribution faithfulness that CNNs naturally possess. To address this issue, we introduce LibraGrad -- a theoretically grounded post-hoc approach that corrects gradient imbalances through pruning and scaling of backward paths, without changing the forward pass or adding computational overhead. We evaluate LibraGrad using three metric families: Faithfulness, which quantifies prediction changes under perturbations of the most and least relevant features; Completeness Error, which measures attribution conservation relative to model outputs; and Segmentation AP, which assesses alignment with human perception. Extensive experiments across 8 architectures, 4 model sizes, and 4 datasets show that LibraGrad universally enhances gradient-based methods, outperforming existing white-box methods -- including Transformer-specific approaches -- across all metrics. We demonstrate superior qualitative results through two complementary evaluations: precise text-prompted region highlighting on CLIP models and accurate class discrimination between co-occurring animals on ImageNet-finetuned models -- two settings on which existing methods often struggle. LibraGrad is effective even on the attention-free MLP-Mixer architecture, indicating potential for extension to other modern architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning has become an important step for finetuning pretrained language models to better follow human instructions and generalize on various tasks. Nowadays, pretrained language models become increasingly larger, and full parameter finetuning is overwhelmingly costly. Therefore, Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) has arisen as a cost-effective practice for instruction tuning because of significantly smaller computational, memory, and storage cost compared to full finetuning. Despite their widespread adaptations, the vast hyperparameter spaces, the number of PEFT methods, the different focus of instruction tuning capabilities make disentangling the impact of each aspect difficult. This study systematically investigates several representative PEFT methods, surveying the effect of hyperparameter choices including training hyperparameters and PEFT-specific hyperparameters, how different models sizes and the number of instruction tasks affect the performance, in-task-distribution memorization and open instruction following capability. Our empirical study shows that only LoRA and adapter can get close to full finetuning with ideal training settings. The ideal training setting includes an appropriate learning rate, largest LoRA rank or adapter size allowed and diverse training tasks. On the other hand, LoRA and adapter suffer from training instability if such an ideal training condition is not met. Additionally, LoRA requires a greater number of tasks for effective unseen task generalization, exhibit slower learning speed. Moreover, LoRA has weaker task-level memorization. Lastly, LoRA and adapter fall short in complex reasoning, coding and long-form generation compared to finetuning in open instruction tuning settings but it shows stronger capabilities compared to adapter.</p>

<p>Abstract: Android malware detection based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models is widely used for mobile device security. Such models offer benefits in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency, but it is often difficult to understand how such learning models make decisions. As a result, these popular malware detection strategies are generally treated as black boxes, which can result in a lack of trust in the decisions made, as well as making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) attempts to shed light on such black box models. In this paper, we apply XAI techniques to ML and DL models that have been trained on a challenging Android malware classification problem. Specifically, the classic ML models considered are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN), while the DL models we consider are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The state-of-the-art XAI techniques that we apply to these trained models are Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), PDP plots, ELI5, and Class Activation Mapping (CAM). We obtain global and local explanation results, and we discuss the utility of XAI techniques in this problem domain. We also provide a literature review of XAI work related to Android malware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshavardhan Battula, Jiacheng Liu, Jaideep Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: In-hospital mortality (IHM) prediction for ICU patients is critical for timely interventions and efficient resource allocation. While structured physiological data provides quantitative insights, clinical notes offer unstructured, context-rich narratives. This study integrates these modalities with Large Language Model (LLM)-generated expert summaries to improve IHM prediction accuracy. Using the MIMIC-III database, we analyzed time-series physiological data and clinical notes from the first 48 hours of ICU admission. Clinical notes were concatenated chronologically for each patient and transformed into expert summaries using Med42-v2 70B. A multi-representational learning framework was developed to integrate these data sources, leveraging LLMs to enhance textual data while mitigating direct reliance on LLM predictions, which can introduce challenges in uncertainty quantification and interpretability. The proposed model achieved an AUPRC of 0.6156 (+36.41%) and an AUROC of 0.8955 (+7.64%) compared to a time-series-only baseline. Expert summaries outperformed clinical notes or time-series data alone, demonstrating the value of LLM-generated knowledge. Performance gains were consistent across demographic groups, with notable improvements in underrepresented populations, underscoring the framework's equitable application potential. By integrating LLM-generated summaries with structured and unstructured data, the framework captures complementary patient information, significantly improving predictive performance. This approach showcases the potential of LLMs to augment critical care prediction models, emphasizing the need for domain-specific validation and advanced integration strategies for broader clinical adoption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.</p>

Although preliminary experiments conducted on the TinyStories dataset yielded suboptimal results, we propose an empirical sampling scheme based on a pretrained denoiser that significantly enhances performance. Additionally, we present a more general hybrid approach that achieves strong performance on more complex datasets, such as Fine Web and Lamini Instruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Does seeing always mean knowing? Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) integrate separately pre-trained vision and language components, often using CLIP-ViT as vision backbone. However, these models frequently encounter a core issue of "cognitive misalignment" between the vision encoder (VE) and the large language model (LLM). Specifically, the VE's representation of visual information may not fully align with LLM's cognitive framework, leading to a mismatch where visual features exceed the language model's interpretive range. To address this, we investigate how variations in VE representations influence LVLM comprehension, especially when the LLM faces VE-Unknown data-images whose ambiguous visual representations challenge the VE's interpretive precision. Accordingly, we construct a multi-granularity landmark dataset and systematically examine the impact of VE-Known and VE-Unknown data on interpretive abilities. Our results show that VE-Unknown data limits LVLM's capacity for accurate understanding, while VE-Known data, rich in distinctive features, helps reduce cognitive misalignment. Building on these insights, we propose Entity-Enhanced Cognitive Alignment (EECA), a method that employs multi-granularity supervision to generate visually enriched, well-aligned tokens that not only integrate within the LLM's embedding space but also align with the LLM's cognitive framework. This alignment markedly enhances LVLM performance in landmark recognition. Our findings underscore the challenges posed by VE-Unknown data and highlight the essential role of cognitive alignment in advancing multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanhui Wang, Yihua Zhang, Ruizheng Bai, Yue Zhao, Sijia Liu, Zhengzhong Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made generative image editing more accessible, enabling creative edits but raising ethical concerns, particularly regarding malicious edits to human portraits that threaten privacy and identity security. Existing protection methods primarily rely on adversarial perturbations to nullify edits but often fail against diverse editing requests. We propose FaceLock, a novel approach to portrait protection that optimizes adversarial perturbations to destroy or significantly alter biometric information, rendering edited outputs biometrically unrecognizable. FaceLock integrates facial recognition and visual perception into perturbation optimization to provide robust protection against various editing attempts. We also highlight flaws in commonly used evaluation metrics and reveal how they can be manipulated, emphasizing the need for reliable assessments of protection. Experiments show FaceLock outperforms baselines in defending against malicious edits and is robust against purification techniques. Ablation studies confirm its stability and broad applicability across diffusion-based editing algorithms. Our work advances biometric defense and sets the foundation for privacy-preserving practices in image editing. The code is available at: https://github.com/taco-group/FaceLock.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazia Tasnim, Bryan A. Plummer</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental learning aims to adapt to new sets of categories over time with minimal computational overhead. Prior work often addresses this task by training efficient task-specific adaptors that modify frozen layer weights or features to capture relevant information without affecting predictions on previously learned categories. While these adaptors are generally more efficient than finetuning the entire network, they still require tens to hundreds of thousands of task-specific trainable parameters even for relatively small networks, making it challenging to operate on resource-constrained environments with high communication costs like edge devices or mobile phones. Thus, we propose Reparameterized, Compact weight Adaptation for Sequential Tasks (RECAST), a novel method that dramatically reduces task-specific trainable parameters to fewer than 50 - several orders of magnitude less than competing methods like LoRA. RECAST accomplishes this efficiency by learning to decompose layer weights into a soft parameter-sharing framework consisting of shared weight templates and very few module-specific scaling factors or coefficients. This soft parameter-sharing framework allows for effective task-wise reparameterization by tuning only these coefficients while keeping templates frozen.A key innovation of RECAST is the novel weight reconstruction pipeline called Neural Mimicry, which eliminates the need for pretraining from scratch. This allows for high-fidelity emulation of existing pretrained weights within our framework and provides quick adaptability to any model scale and architecture. Extensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate RECAST outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 3% across various scales, architectures, and parameter spaces Moreover, we show that RECAST's architecture-agnostic nature allows for seamless integration with existing methods, further boosting performance.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16896">Enhancing Fluorescence Lifetime Parameter Estimation Accuracy with Differential Transformer Based Deep Learning Model Incorporating Pixelwise Instrument Response Function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Erbas, Vikas Pandey, Navid Ibtehaj Nizam, Nanxue Yuan, Amit Verma, Margarida Barosso, Xavier Intes</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is an important molecular imaging modality that can provide unique information for biomedical applications. FLI is based on acquiring and processing photon time of arrival histograms. The shape and temporal offset of these histograms depends on many factors, such as the instrument response function (IRF), optical properties, and the topographic profile of the sample. Several inverse solver analytical methods have been developed to compute the underlying fluorescence lifetime parameters, but most of them are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Thus, deep learning (DL) algorithms have progressively replaced computation methods in fluorescence lifetime parameter estimation. Often, DL models are trained with simple datasets either generated through simulation or a simple experiment where the fluorophore surface profile is mostly flat; therefore, DL models often do not perform well on samples with complex surface profiles such as ex-vivo organs or in-vivo whole intact animals. Herein, we introduce a new DL architecture using state-of-the-art Differential Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, MFliNet (Macroscopic FLI Network), that takes an additional input of IRF together with TPSF, addressing discrepancies in the photon time-of-arrival distribution. We demonstrate the model's performance through carefully designed, complex tissue-mimicking phantoms and preclinical in-vivo cancer xenograft experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arian Mehrfard, Bharanidhar Duraisamy, Stefan Haag, Florian Geiss</p>
<p>Abstract: Kalman Filters (KF) are fundamental to real-time state estimation applications, including radar-based tracking systems used in modern driver assistance and safety technologies. In a linear dynamical system with Gaussian noise distributions the KF is the optimal estimator. However, real-world systems often deviate from these assumptions. This deviation combined with the success of deep learning across many disciplines has prompted the exploration of data driven approaches that leverage deep learning for filtering applications. These learned state estimators are often reported to outperform traditional model based systems. In this work, one prevalent model, KalmanNet, was selected and evaluated on automotive radar data to assess its performance under real-world conditions and compare it to an interacting multiple models (IMM) filter. The evaluation is based on raw and normalized errors as well as the state uncertainty. The results demonstrate that KalmanNet is outperformed by the IMM filter and indicate that while data-driven methods such as KalmanNet show promise, their current lack of reliability and robustness makes them unsuited for safety-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ezra Ameperosa, Jeremy A. Collins, Mrinal Jain, Animesh Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning in robotics faces significant challenges in generalization due to the complexity of robotic environments and the high cost of data collection. We introduce RoCoDA, a novel method that unifies the concepts of invariance, equivariance, and causality within a single framework to enhance data augmentation for imitation learning. RoCoDA leverages causal invariance by modifying task-irrelevant subsets of the environment state without affecting the policy's output. Simultaneously, we exploit SE(3) equivariance by applying rigid body transformations to object poses and adjusting corresponding actions to generate synthetic demonstrations. We validate RoCoDA through extensive experiments on five robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating improvements in policy performance, generalization, and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our policies exhibit robust generalization to unseen object poses, textures, and the presence of distractors. Furthermore, we observe emergent behavior such as re-grasping, indicating policies trained with RoCoDA possess a deeper understanding of task dynamics. By leveraging invariance, equivariance, and causality, RoCoDA provides a principled approach to data augmentation in imitation learning, bridging the gap between geometric symmetries and causal reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamid Kamangir, Brent. S. Sams, Nick Dokoozlian, Luis Sanchez, J. Mason. Earles</p>
<p>Abstract: Crop yield prediction is essential for agricultural planning but remains challenging due to the complex interactions between weather, climate, and management practices. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning-based multi-model called Climate-Management Aware Vision Transformer (CMAViT), designed for pixel-level vineyard yield predictions. CMAViT integrates both spatial and temporal data by leveraging remote sensing imagery and short-term meteorological data, capturing the effects of growing season variations. Additionally, it incorporates management practices, which are represented in text form, using a cross-attention encoder to model their interaction with time-series data. This innovative multi-modal transformer tested on a large dataset from 2016-2019 covering 2,200 hectares and eight grape cultivars including more than 5 million vines, outperforms traditional models like UNet-ConvLSTM, excelling in spatial variability capture and yield prediction, particularly for extreme values in vineyards. CMAViT achieved an R2 of 0.84 and a MAPE of 8.22% on an unseen test dataset. Masking specific modalities lowered performance: excluding management practices, climate data, and both reduced R2 to 0.73, 0.70, and 0.72, respectively, and raised MAPE to 11.92%, 12.66%, and 12.39%, highlighting each modality's importance for accurate yield prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb S. Spradlin, Jordan A. Caraballo-Vega, Jian Li, Mark L. Carroll, Jie Gong, Paul M. Montesano</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have the potential to transform the landscape of remote sensing (RS) data analysis by enabling large computer vision models to be pre-trained on vast amounts of remote sensing data. These models can then be fine-tuned with small amounts of labeled training and applied to a variety of applications. Most existing foundation models are designed for high spatial resolution, cloud-free satellite imagery or photos, limiting their applicability in scenarios that require frequent temporal monitoring or broad spectral profiles. As a result, foundation models trained solely on cloud-free images have limited utility for applications that involve atmospheric variables or require atmospheric corrections. We introduce SatVision-TOA, a novel foundation model pre-trained on 14-band MODIS L1B Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance imagery, addressing the need for models pre-trained to handle moderate- and coarse-resolution all-sky remote sensing data. The SatVision-TOA model is pre-trained using a Masked-Image-Modeling (MIM) framework and the SwinV2 architecture, and learns detailed contextual representations through self-supervised learning without the need for labels. It is a 3 billion parameter model that is trained on 100 million images. To our knowledge this is the largest foundation model trained solely on satellite RS imagery. Results show that SatVision-TOA achieves superior performance over baseline methods on downstream tasks such as 3D cloud retrieval. Notably, the model achieves a mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 0.46, a substantial improvement over the baseline mIOU of 0.22. Additionally, the rate of false negative results in the fine-tuning task were reduced by over 50% compared to the baseline. Our work advances pre-trained vision modeling for multispectral RS by learning from a variety of atmospheric and aerosol conditions to improve cloud and land surface monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemin Kim, Bryan S Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks like text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependency across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions or are constrained to limited prompts, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose Free$^2$Guide, a novel gradient-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts without requiring additional model training. Leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward model. Additionally, our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models, including large-scale image-based models, to synergistically enhance alignment without incurring substantial computational overhead. We demonstrate that Free$^2$Guide significantly improves text alignment across various dimensions and enhances the overall quality of generated videos.</p>

This work proposes a novel method to conformalise conditional normalising flows, specifically addressing the problem of obtaining prediction regions for multi-step time series forecasting. Our approach leverages the flexibility of normalising flows to generate potentially disjoint prediction regions, leading to improved predictive efficiency in the presence of potential multimodal predictive distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Sweet</p>
<p>Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) has optimal regret and excellent empirical performance in multi-armed bandit problems. Yet, in Bayesian optimization, TS underperforms popular acquisition functions (e.g., EI, UCB). TS samples arms according to the probability that they are optimal. A recent algorithm, P-Star Sampler (PSS), performs such a sampling via Hit-and-Run. We present an improved version, Stagger Thompson Sampler (STS). STS more precisely locates the maximizer than does TS using less computation time. We demonstrate that STS outperforms TS, PSS, and other acquisition methods in numerical experiments of optimizations of several test functions across a broad range of dimension. Additionally, since PSS was originally presented not as a standalone acquisition method but as an input to a batching algorithm called Minimal Terminal Variance (MTV), we also demon-strate that STS matches PSS performance when used as the input to MTV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Nasehi, Farhana Choudhury, Egemen Tanin</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the substantial rise in online retail and e-commerce in recent years, the demand for efficient and fast solutions to Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) has become critical. To manage the increasing demand, companies have adopted the strategy of adding more depots. However, the presence of multiple depots introduces additional complexities, making existing VRP solutions suboptimal for addressing the Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP). Traditional methods for solving the MDVRP often require significant computation time, making them unsuitable for large-scale instances. Additionally, existing learning-based solutions for the MDVRP struggle with generalizability and fail to deliver high-quality results for scenarios involving a large number of customers. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for MDVRP. Our approach employs an attention mechanism, featuring a decoder with two key layers: one layer to consider the states of all vehicles and learn to select the most suitable vehicle based on the proximity of unassigned customers, and another layer to focus on assigning a customer to the selected vehicle. This approach delivers high-quality solutions for large-scale MDVRP instances and demonstrates remarkable generalizability across varying numbers of customers and depots. Its adaptability and performance make it a practical and deployable solution for real-world logistics challenges.</p>

To enable rapid recovery, accurately predicting future outage numbers is essential. Rather than relying on simple point estimates, we analyze extensive quarter-hourly outage data and develop a graph conformal prediction method that delivers accurate prediction regions for outage numbers across the states for a time period. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through extensive numerical experiments in several states affected by extreme weather events that led to widespread outages.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of tabular data from diverse sources is often hindered by inconsistencies in formatting and representation, posing significant challenges for data analysts and personal digital assistants. Existing methods for automating tabular data transformations are limited in scope, often focusing on specific types of transformations or lacking interpretability. In this paper, we introduce TabulaX, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-class tabular transformations. TabulaX first classifies input tables into four transformation classes (string-based, numerical, algorithmic, and general) and then applies tailored methods to generate human-interpretable transformation functions, such as numeric formulas or programming code. This approach enhances transparency and allows users to understand and modify the mappings. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that TabulaX outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, supports a broader class of transformations, and generates interpretable transformations that can be efficiently applied.</p>

<p>Abstract: Realised volatility has become increasingly prominent in volatility forecasting due to its ability to capture intraday price fluctuations. With a growing variety of realised volatility estimators, each with unique advantages and limitations, selecting an optimal estimator may introduce challenges. In this thesis, aiming to synthesise the impact of various realised volatility measures on volatility forecasting, we propose an extension of the Realised GARCH model that incorporates an autoencoder-generated synthetic realised measure, combining the information from multiple realised measures in a nonlinear manner. Our proposed model extends existing linear methods, such as Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis, to reduce the dimensionality of realised measures. The empirical evaluation, conducted across four major stock markets from January 2000 to June 2022 and including the period of COVID-19, demonstrates both the feasibility of applying an autoencoder to synthesise volatility measures and the superior effectiveness of the proposed model in one-step-ahead rolling volatility forecasting. The model exhibits enhanced flexibility in parameter estimations across each rolling window, outperforming traditional linear approaches. These findings indicate that nonlinear dimension reduction offers further adaptability and flexibility in improving the synthetic realised measure, with promising implications for future volatility forecasting applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite having triggered devastating pandemics in the past, our ability to quantitatively assess the emergence potential of individual strains of animal influenza viruses remains limited. This study introduces Emergenet, a tool to infer a digital twin of sequence evolution to chart how new variants might emerge in the wild. Our predictions based on Emergenets built only using 220,151 Hemagglutinnin (HA) sequences consistently outperform WHO seasonal vaccine recommendations for H1N1/H3N2 subtypes over two decades (average match-improvement: 3.73 AAs, 28.40\%), and are at par with state-of-the-art approaches that use more detailed phenotypic annotations. Finally, our generative models are used to scalably calculate the current odds of emergence of animal strains not yet in human circulation, which strongly correlates with CDC's expert-assessed Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) scores (Pearson's $r = 0.721, p = 10^{-4}$). A minimum five orders of magnitude speedup over CDC's assessment (seconds vs months) then enabled us to analyze 6,354 animal strains collected post-2020 to identify 35 strains with high emergence scores ($> 7.7$). The Emergenet framework opens the door to preemptive pandemic mitigation through targeted inoculation of animal hosts before the first human infection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sylvain Sardy, Maxime van Cutsem, Xiaoyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The motivation for sparse learners is to compress the inputs (features) by selecting only the ones needed for good generalization. Linear models with LASSO-type regularization achieve this by setting the weights of irrelevant features to zero, effectively identifying and ignoring them. In artificial neural networks, this selective focus can be achieved by pruning the input layer. Given a cost function enhanced with a sparsity-promoting penalty, our proposal selects a regularization term $\lambda$ (without the use of cross-validation or a validation set) that creates a local minimum in the cost function at the origin where no features are selected. This local minimum acts as a baseline, meaning that if there is no strong enough signal to justify a feature inclusion, the local minimum remains at zero with a high prescribed probability. The method is flexible, applying to complex models ranging from shallow to deep artificial neural networks and supporting various cost functions and sparsity-promoting penalties. We empirically show a remarkable phase transition in the probability of retrieving the relevant features, as well as good generalization thanks to the choice of $\lambda$, the non-convex penalty and the optimization scheme developed. This approach can be seen as a form of compressed sensing for complex models, allowing us to distill high-dimensional data into a compact, interpretable subset of meaningful features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biological processes, functions, and properties are intricately linked to the ensemble of protein conformations, rather than being solely determined by a single stable conformation. In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Accurate detection and tracking of small objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes are critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial in improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showcasing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects.

<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are known for their poor performance in out-of-distribution datasets. An issue that was addressed in previous works through ensemble learning, answer re-ranking, or artificially growing the training set. In this work, we show for the first time that robust Visual Question Answering is attainable by simply enhancing the training strategy. Our proposed approach, Task Progressive Curriculum Learning (TPCL), breaks the main VQA problem into smaller, easier tasks based on the question type. Then, it progressively trains the model on a (carefully crafted) sequence of tasks. We further support the method by a novel distributional-based difficulty measurer. Our approach is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement. We demonstrate TPCL effectiveness through a comprehensive evaluation on standard datasets. Without either data augmentation or explicit debiasing mechanism, it achieves state-of-the-art on VQA-CP v2, VQA-CP v1 and VQA v2 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TPCL outperforms the most competitive robust VQA approaches by more than 5% and 7% on VQA-CP v2 and VQA-CP v1; respectively. TPCL also can boost VQA baseline backbone performance by up to 28.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maorong Wang, Jiafeng Mao, Xueting Wang, Toshihiko Yamasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of denoising diffusion models has significantly advanced text-to-image generation. While these large-scale pretrained models show excellent performance in general image synthesis, downstream objectives often require fine-tuning to meet specific criteria such as aesthetics or human preference. Reward gradient-based strategies are promising in this context, yet existing methods are limited to single-reward tasks, restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios that demand adapting to multiple objectives introduced incrementally over time. In this paper, we first define this more realistic and unexplored problem, termed Reward Incremental Learning (RIL), where models are desired to adapt to multiple downstream objectives incrementally. Additionally, while the models adapt to the ever-emerging new objectives, we observe a unique form of catastrophic forgetting in diffusion model fine-tuning, affecting both metric-wise and visual structure-wise image quality. To address this catastrophic forgetting challenge, we propose Reward Incremental Distillation (RID), a method that mitigates forgetting with minimal computational overhead, enabling stable performance across sequential reward tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RID in achieving consistent, high-quality generation in RIL scenarios. The source code of our work will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Jiaxuan Zhao, Lingling Li, Licheng Jiao, Fang Liu, Xu Liu, Shuyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural architecture search (GNAS) can customize high-performance graph neural network architectures for specific graph tasks or datasets. However, existing GNAS methods begin searching for architectures from a zero-knowledge state, ignoring the prior knowledge that may improve the search efficiency. The available knowledge base (e.g. NAS-Bench-Graph) contains many rich architectures and their multiple performance metrics, such as the accuracy (#Acc) and number of parameters (#Params). This study proposes exploiting such prior knowledge to accelerate the multi-objective evolutionary search on a new graph dataset, named knowledge-aware evolutionary GNAS (KEGNAS). KEGNAS employs the knowledge base to train a knowledge model and a deep multi-output Gaussian process (DMOGP) in one go, which generates and evaluates transfer architectures in only a few GPU seconds. The knowledge model first establishes a dataset-to-architecture mapping, which can quickly generate candidate transfer architectures for a new dataset. Subsequently, the DMOGP with architecture and dataset encodings is designed to predict multiple performance metrics for candidate transfer architectures on the new dataset. According to the predicted metrics, non-dominated candidate transfer architectures are selected to warm-start the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing the #Acc and #Params on a new dataset. Empirical studies on NAS-Bench-Graph and five real-world datasets show that KEGNAS swiftly generates top-performance architectures, achieving 4.27% higher accuracy than advanced evolutionary baselines and 11.54% higher accuracy than advanced differentiable baselines. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate that the use of prior knowledge significantly improves the search performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marek Wodzinski, Mateusz Daniol, Daria Hemmerling</p>
<p>Abstract: Every year, thousands of people suffer from skull damage and require personalized implants to fill the cranial cavity. Unfortunately, the waiting time for reconstruction surgery can extend to several weeks or even months, especially in less developed countries. One factor contributing to the extended waiting period is the intricate process of personalized implant modeling. Currently, the preparation of these implants by experienced biomechanical experts is both costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in deep learning, offer promising potential for automating the process. However, deep learning-based cranial reconstruction faces several challenges: (i) the limited size of training datasets, (ii) the high resolution of the volumetric data, and (iii) significant data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by enhancing the reconstruction through learnable symmetry enforcement. We demonstrate that it is possible to train a neural network dedicated to calculating skull symmetry, which can be utilized either as an additional objective function during training or as a post-reconstruction objective during the refinement step. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed method using open SkullBreak and SkullFix datasets, and qualitatively using real clinical cases. The results indicate that the symmetry-preserving reconstruction network achieves considerably better outcomes compared to the baseline (0.94/0.94/1.31 vs 0.84/0.76/2.43 in terms of DSC, bDSC, and HD95). Moreover, the results are comparable to the best-performing methods while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (< 500 vs > 100,000 GPU hours). The proposed method is a considerable contribution to the field of applied artificial intelligence in medicine and is a step toward automatic cranial defect reconstruction in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihui Zhang, Xiaoshuai Hao, Hanning Yuan, Lianhua Chi, Qi Guo, Qi Li, Ziqiang Yuan, Jinhui Pang, Yexin Li, Sijie Ruan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view contrastive clustering (MVCC) has gained significant attention for generating consistent clustering structures from multiple views through contrastive learning. However, most existing MVCC methods create cross-views by combining any two views, leading to a high volume of unreliable pairs. Furthermore, these approaches often overlook discrepancies in multi-view representations, resulting in representation degeneration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel model called Dual-Weighted Contrastive Learning (DWCL) for Multi-View Clustering. Specifically, to reduce the impact of unreliable cross-views, we introduce an innovative Best-Other (B-O) contrastive mechanism that enhances the representation of individual views at a low computational cost. Furthermore, we develop a dual weighting strategy that combines a view quality weight, reflecting the quality of each view, with a view discrepancy weight. This approach effectively mitigates representation degeneration by downplaying cross-views that are both low in quality and high in discrepancy. We theoretically validate the efficiency of the B-O contrastive mechanism and the effectiveness of the dual weighting strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DWCL outperforms previous methods across eight multi-view datasets, showcasing superior performance and robustness in MVCC. Specifically, our method achieves absolute accuracy improvements of 5.4\% and 5.6\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the Caltech6V7 and MSRCv1 datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Corey Lammie, Manuel Le Gallo, Bipin Rajendran</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck, accelerating neural network computations and improving computational efficiency. While AIMC has demonstrated success with architectures such as CNNs, MLPs, and RNNs, deploying transformer-based models using AIMC presents unique challenges. Transformers are expected to handle diverse downstream tasks and adapt to new user data or instructions after deployment, which requires more flexible approaches to suit AIMC constraints.
  In this paper, we propose a novel method for deploying pre-trained transformer models onto AIMC hardware. Unlike traditional approaches requiring hardware-aware training, our technique allows direct deployment without the need for retraining the original model. Instead, we utilize lightweight, low-rank adapters -- compact modules stored in digital cores -- to adapt the model to hardware constraints. We validate our approach on MobileBERT, demonstrating accuracy on par with, or even exceeding, a traditional hardware-aware training approach. Our method is particularly appealing in multi-task scenarios, as it enables a single analog model to be reused across multiple tasks. Moreover, it supports on-chip adaptation to new hardware constraints and tasks without updating analog weights, providing a flexible and versatile solution for real-world AI applications. Code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kesen Wang, Marc G. Genton</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent decades, statisticians have been increasingly encountering spatial data that exhibit non-Gaussian behaviors such as asymmetry and heavy-tailedness. As a result, the assumptions of symmetry and fixed tail weight in Gaussian processes have become restrictive and may fail to capture the intrinsic properties of the data. To address the limitations of the Gaussian models, a variety of skewed models has been proposed, of which the popularity has grown rapidly. These skewed models introduce parameters that govern skewness and tail weight. Among various proposals in the literature, unified skewed distributions, such as the Unified Skew-Normal (SUN), have received considerable attention. In this work, we revisit a more concise and intepretable re-parameterization of the SUN distribution and apply the distribution to random fields by constructing a generalized unified skew-normal (GSUN) spatial process. We demonstrate { that the GSUN is a valid spatial process by showing its vanishing correlation in large distances} and provide the corresponding spatial interpolation method. In addition, we develop an inference mechanism for the GSUN process using the concept of neural Bayes estimators with deep graphical attention networks (GATs) and encoder transformer. We show the superiority of our proposed estimator over the conventional CNN-based architectures regarding stability and accuracy by means of a simulation study and application to Pb-contaminated soil data. Furthermore, we show that the GSUN process is different from the conventional Gaussian processes and Tukey g-and-h processes, through the probability integral transform (PIT).</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving optimal performance of video diffusion transformers within given data and compute budget is crucial due to their high training costs. This necessitates precisely determining the optimal model size and training hyperparameters before large-scale training. While scaling laws are employed in language models to predict performance, their existence and accurate derivation in visual generation models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically analyze scaling laws for video diffusion transformers and confirm their presence. Moreover, we discover that, unlike language models, video diffusion models are more sensitive to learning rate and batch size, two hyperparameters often not precisely modeled. To address this, we propose a new scaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and compute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance and reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods, within a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more generalized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and compute budget. This enables performance prediction for non-optimal model sizes, which may also be appealed under practical inference cost constraints, achieving a better trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Hanchen Jiang, Yasi Zhang, Zhi Zhang, Yixin Wan, Andrew Lizarraga, Shufan Li, Ying Nian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling by producing high-fidelity, diverse, and visually realistic images from textual prompts. Despite these advances, existing models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and attributes, often misaligning modifiers with their corresponding nouns or neglecting certain elements. Recent attention-based methods have improved object inclusion and linguistic binding, but still face challenges such as attribute misbinding and a lack of robust generalization guarantees. Leveraging the PAC-Bayes framework, we propose a Bayesian approach that designs custom priors over attention distributions to enforce desirable properties, including divergence between objects, alignment between modifiers and their corresponding nouns, minimal attention to irrelevant tokens, and regularization for better generalization. Our approach treats the attention mechanism as an interpretable component, enabling fine-grained control and improved attribute-object alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on standard benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. By integrating custom priors into the denoising process, our method enhances image quality and addresses long-standing challenges in T2I diffusion models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William F. Podlaski, Christian K. Machens</p>
<p>Abstract: Associative memory architectures such as the Hopfield network have long been important conceptual and theoretical models for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, translating these abstract models into spiking neural networks has been surprisingly difficult. Indeed, much previous work has been restricted to storing a small number of primarily non-overlapping memories in large networks, thereby limiting their scalability. Here, we revisit the associative memory problem in light of recent advances in understanding spike-based computation. Using a recently-established geometric framework, we show that the spiking activity for a large class of all-inhibitory networks is situated on a low-dimensional, convex, and piecewise-linear manifold, with dynamics that move along the manifold. We then map the associative memory problem onto these dynamics, and demonstrate how the vertices of a hypercubic manifold can be used to store stable, overlapping activity patterns with a direct correspondence to the original Hopfield model. We propose several learning rules, and demonstrate a linear scaling of the storage capacity with the number of neurons, as well as robust pattern completion abilities. Overall, this work serves as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a geometrical perspective to design dynamics on neural manifolds, with implications for neuroscience and machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolai Hermann, Jorge Condor, Piotr Didyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Life insurance, like other forms of insurance, relies heavily on large volumes of data. The business model is based on an exchange where companies receive payments in return for the promise to provide coverage in case of an accident. Thus, trust in the integrity of the data stored in databases is crucial. One method to ensure data reliability is the automatic detection of anomalies. While this approach is highly useful, it is also challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data that distinguish between normal and anomalous contracts or inter\-actions. This manuscript discusses several classical and modern unsupervised anomaly detection methods and compares their performance across two different datasets. In order to facilitate the adoption of these methods by companies, this work also explores ways to automate the process, making it accessible even to non-data scientists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Volodymyr Karpenko, Taimoor Tariq, Jorge Condor, Piotr Didyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep-learning based super-resolution techniques process images and videos independently of the underlying content and viewing conditions. However, the sensitivity of the human visual system to image details changes depending on the underlying content characteristics, such as spatial frequency, luminance, color, contrast, or motion. This observation hints that computational resources spent on up-sampling visual content may be wasted whenever a viewer cannot resolve the results. Motivated by this observation, we propose a perceptually inspired and architecture-agnostic approach for controlling the visual quality and efficiency of super-resolution techniques. The core is a perceptual model that dynamically guides super-resolution methods according to the human's sensitivity to image details. Our technique leverages the limitations of the human visual system to improve the efficiency of super-resolution techniques by focusing computational resources on perceptually important regions; judged on the basis of factors such as adapting luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, motion, and viewing conditions. We demonstrate the application of our proposed model in combination with network branching, and network complexity reduction to improve the computational efficiency of super-resolution methods without visible quality loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing FLOPS by factors of 2$\mathbf{x}$ and greater, without sacrificing perceived quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the approximation and estimation rates of conditional diffusion transformers (DiTs) with classifier-free guidance. We present a comprehensive analysis for ``in-context'' conditional DiTs under four common data assumptions. We show that both conditional DiTs and their latent variants lead to the minimax optimality of unconditional DiTs under identified settings. Specifically, we discretize the input domains into infinitesimal grids and then perform a term-by-term Taylor expansion on the conditional diffusion score function under H\"older smooth data assumption. This enables fine-grained use of transformers' universal approximation through a more detailed piecewise constant approximation and hence obtains tighter bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the latent setting under the linear latent subspace assumption. We not only show that latent conditional DiTs achieve lower bounds than conditional DiTs both in approximation and estimation, but also show the minimax optimality of latent unconditional DiTs. Our findings establish statistical limits for conditional and unconditional DiTs, and offer practical guidance toward developing more efficient and accurate DiT models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the updated version of the HSI-Drive dataset aimed at developing automated driving systems (ADS) using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). The v2.0 version includes new annotated images from videos recorded during winter and fall in real driving scenarios. Added to the spring and summer images included in the previous v1.1 version, the new dataset contains 752 images covering the four seasons. In this paper, we show the improvements achieved over previously published results obtained on the v1.1 dataset, showcasing the enhanced performance of models trained on the new v2.0 dataset. We also show the progress made in comprehensive scene understanding by experimenting with more capable image segmentation models. These models include new segmentation categories aimed at the identification of essential road safety objects such as the presence of vehicles and road signs, as well as highly vulnerable groups like pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, we provide evidence of the performance and robustness of the models when applied to segmenting HSI video sequences captured in various environments and conditions. Finally, for a correct assessment of the results described in this work, the constraints imposed by the processing platforms that can sensibly be deployed in vehicles for ADS must be taken into account. Thus, and although implementation details are out of the scope of this paper, we focus our research on the development of computationally efficient, lightweight ML models that can eventually operate at high throughput rates.

<p>Abstract: Transducer neural networks have emerged as the mainstream approach for streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR), offering state-of-the-art performance in balancing accuracy and latency. In the conventional framework, streaming transducer models are trained to maximize the likelihood function based on non-streaming recursion rules. However, this approach leads to a mismatch between training and inference, resulting in the issue of deformed likelihood and consequently suboptimal ASR accuracy. We introduce a mathematical quantification of the gap between the actual likelihood and the deformed likelihood, namely forward variable causal compensation (FoCC). We also present its estimator, FoCCE, as a solution to estimate the exact likelihood. Through experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset, we show that FoCCE training improves the accuracy of the streaming transducers.</p>

The work addresses the challenges of shaping and deploying multiple layer fully convolutional networks (FCN) for low-latency, on-board image semantic segmentation using resource- and power-constrained processing devices. The paper describes in detail the steps followed to redesign and customize a successfully trained HSI segmentation lightweight FCN that was previously tested on a high-end heterogeneous multiprocessing system-on-chip (MPSoC) to accommodate it to the constraints imposed by a low-cost SOM. This SOM features a lower-end but much cheaper MPSoC suitable for the deployment of automatic driving systems (ADS). In particular the article reports the data- and hardware-specific quantization techniques utilized to fit the FCN into a commercial fixed-point programmable AI coprocessor IP, and proposes a full customized post-training quantization scheme to reduce computation and storage costs without compromising segmentation accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forward gradient descent (FGD) has been proposed as a biologically more plausible alternative of gradient descent as it can be computed without backward pass. Considering the linear model with $d$ parameters, previous work has found that the prediction error of FGD is, however, by a factor $d$ slower than the prediction error of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this paper we show that by computing $\ell$ FGD steps based on each training sample, this suboptimality factor becomes $d/(\ell \wedge d)$ and thus the suboptimality of the rate disappears if $\ell \gtrsim d.$ We also show that FGD with repeated sampling can adapt to low-dimensional structure in the input distribution. The main mathematical challenge lies in controlling the dependencies arising from the repeated sampling process.</p>

<p>Abstract: White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are key neuroradiological markers of small vessel disease present in brain MRI. Assessment of WMH is important in research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g head motion). In this work, we apply the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation to the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find a combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score on in-domain and out-of-distribution data. We demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted for WMH segmentation and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration, with median class balanced accuracy for classification models with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) of 0.71/0.66/0.60 in the Deep WMH and 0.82/0.77/0.73 in the Periventricular WMH regions respectively. We demonstrate that stochastic UQ techniques with high sample diversity can improve the detection of poor quality segmentations. Finally, we qualitatively analyse the semantic information captured by UQ techniques and demonstrate that uncertainty can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions, while identifying clusters of small WMH in deep white matter unsegmented by the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan J. Bird</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a challenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate readability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to address this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based text classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key Stages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text data, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel, 500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of linguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these modalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach outperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused with the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web application, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights on text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and recommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven decision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based recommendations into lesson planning for English literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gino Kwun, Bingzhi Zhang, Quntao Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative quantum machine learning has gained significant attention for its ability to produce quantum states with desired distributions. Among various quantum generative models, quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 100602 (2024)] provide a promising approach with stepwise learning that resolves the training issues. However, the requirement of high-fidelity scrambling unitaries in QuDDPM poses a challenge in near-term implementation. We propose the \textit{mixed-state quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model} (MSQuDDPM) to eliminate the need for scrambling unitaries. Our approach focuses on adapting the quantum noise channels to the model architecture, which integrates depolarizing noise channels in the forward diffusion process and parameterized quantum circuits with projective measurements in the backward denoising steps. We also introduce several techniques to improve MSQuDDPM, including a cosine-exponent schedule of noise interpolation, the use of single-qubit random ancilla, and superfidelity-based cost functions to enhance the convergence. We evaluate MSQuDDPM on quantum ensemble generation tasks, demonstrating its successful performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bipasha Banerjee, William A. Ingram, Edward A. Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional archival practices for describing electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) rely on broad, high-level metadata schemes that fail to capture the depth, complexity, and interdisciplinary nature of these long scholarly works. The lack of detailed, chapter-level content descriptions impedes researchers' ability to locate specific sections or themes, thereby reducing discoverability and overall accessibility. By providing chapter-level metadata information, we improve the effectiveness of ETDs as research resources. This makes it easier for scholars to navigate them efficiently and extract valuable insights. The absence of such metadata further obstructs interdisciplinary research by obscuring connections across fields, hindering new academic discoveries and collaboration. In this paper, we propose a machine learning and AI-driven solution to automatically categorize ETD chapters. This solution is intended to improve discoverability and promote understanding of chapters. Our approach enriches traditional archival practices by providing context-rich descriptions that facilitate targeted navigation and improved access. We aim to support interdisciplinary research and make ETDs more accessible. By providing chapter-level classification labels and using them to index in our developed prototype system, we make content in ETD chapters more discoverable and usable for a diverse range of scholarly needs. Implementing this AI-enhanced approach allows archives to serve researchers better, enabling efficient access to relevant information and supporting deeper engagement with ETDs. This will increase the impact of ETDs as research tools, foster interdisciplinary exploration, and reinforce the role of archives in scholarly communication within the data-intensive academic landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suramya Jadhav, Abhay Shanbhag, Amogh Thakurdesai, Ridhima Sinare, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-resource languages face significant challenges due to the lack of sufficient linguistic data, resources, and tools for tasks such as supervised learning, annotation, and classification. This shortage hinders the development of accurate models and datasets, making it difficult to perform critical NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or hate speech detection. To bridge this gap, Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for potential annotators, capable of generating datasets and resources for these underrepresented languages. In this paper, we focus on Marathi, a low-resource language, and evaluate the performance of both closed-source and open-source LLMs as annotators. We assess models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemma 2 (2B and 9B), and Llama 3.1 (8B) on classification tasks including sentiment analysis, news classification, and hate speech detection. Our findings reveal that while LLMs excel in annotation tasks for high-resource languages like English, they still fall short when applied to Marathi. Even advanced closed models like Gemini and GPT underperform in comparison to BERT-based baselines, highlighting the limitations of LLMs as annotators for low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhay Shanbhag, Suramya Jadhav, Amogh Thakurdesai, Ridhima Sinare, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages presents significant challenges, particularly due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and linguistic resources. The choice of embeddings plays a critical role in enhancing the performance of NLP tasks, such as news classification, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection, especially for low-resource languages like Marathi. In this study, we investigate the impact of various embedding techniques- Contextual BERT-based, Non-Contextual BERT-based, and FastText-based on NLP classification tasks specific to the Marathi language. Our research includes a thorough evaluation of both compressed and uncompressed embeddings, providing a comprehensive overview of how these embeddings perform across different scenarios. Specifically, we compare two BERT model embeddings, Muril and MahaBERT, as well as two FastText model embeddings, IndicFT and MahaFT. Our evaluation includes applying embeddings to a Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) classifier for task performance assessment, as well as TSNE visualizations to observe the spatial distribution of these embeddings. The results demonstrate that contextual embeddings outperform non-contextual embeddings. Furthermore, BERT-based non-contextual embeddings extracted from the first BERT embedding layer yield better results than FastText-based embeddings, suggesting a potential alternative to FastText embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bat-Sheva Einbinder, Shai Feldman, Stephen Bates, Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, Asaf Gendler, Yaniv Romano</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the robustness of conformal prediction, a powerful tool for uncertainty quantification, to label noise. Our analysis tackles both regression and classification problems, characterizing when and how it is possible to construct uncertainty sets that correctly cover the unobserved noiseless ground truth labels. We further extend our theory and formulate the requirements for correctly controlling a general loss function, such as the false negative proportion, with noisy labels. Our theory and experiments suggest that conformal prediction and risk-controlling techniques with noisy labels attain conservative risk over the clean ground truth labels whenever the noise is dispersive and increases variability. In other adversarial cases, we can also correct for noise of bounded size in the conformal prediction algorithm in order to ensure achieving the correct risk of the ground truth labels without score or data regularity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caterina Fuster-Barcel\'o, Carmen C\'amara, Pedro Peris-L\'opez</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the course of the past two decades, a substantial body of research has substantiated the viability of utilising cardiac signals as a biometric modality. This paper presents a novel approach for patient identification in healthcare systems using electrocardiogram signals. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to classify users based on electrocardiomatrices, a specific type of image derived from ECG signals. The proposed identification system is evaluated in multiple databases, achieving up to 99.84\% accuracy on healthy subjects, 97.09\% on patients with cardiovascular diseases, and 97.89% on mixed populations including both healthy and arrhythmic patients. The system also performs robustly under varying activity conditions, achieving 91.32% accuracy in scenarios involving different physical activities. These consistent and reliable results, with low error rates such as a FAR of 0.01% and FRR of 0.157% in the best cases, demonstrate the method's significant advancement in subject identification within healthcare systems. By considering patients' cardiovascular conditions and activity levels, the proposed approach addresses gaps in the existing literature, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical applications in real-world healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochi Qian, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Off-policy learning enables a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to reason counterfactually about policies that are not executed and is one of the most important ideas in RL. It, however, can lead to instability when combined with function approximation and bootstrapping, two arguably indispensable ingredients for large-scale reinforcement learning. This is the notorious deadly triad. The seminal work Sutton et al. (2008) pioneers Gradient Temporal Difference learning (GTD) as the first solution to the deadly triad, which has enjoyed massive success thereafter. During the derivation of GTD, some intermediate algorithm, called $A^\top$TD, was invented but soon deemed inferior. In this paper, we revisit this $A^\top$TD and prove that a variant of $A^\top$TD, called $A_t^\top$TD, is also an effective solution to the deadly triad. Furthermore, this $A_t^\top$TD only needs one set of parameters and one learning rate. By contrast, GTD has two sets of parameters and two learning rates, making it hard to tune in practice. We provide asymptotic analysis for $A^\top_t$TD and finite sample analysis for a variant of $A^\top_t$TD that additionally involves a projection operator. The convergence rate of this variant is on par with the canonical on-policy temporal difference learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Olszewski, Dawid Rymarczyk, Piotr W\'ojcik, Mateusz Pach, Bartosz Zieli\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Active Visual Exploration (AVE) optimizes the utilization of robotic resources in real-world scenarios by sequentially selecting the most informative observations. However, modern methods require a high computational budget due to processing the same observations multiple times through the autoencoder transformers.
  As a remedy, we introduce a novel approach to AVE called TOken REcycling (TORE). It divides the encoder into extractor and aggregator components. The extractor processes each observation separately, enabling the reuse of tokens passed to the aggregator. Moreover, to further reduce the computations, we decrease the decoder to only one block.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TORE outperforms state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by up to 90\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristiano Mesquita Garcia, Ramon Simoes Abilio, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Alceu de Souza Britto Jr., Jean Paul Barddal</p>
<p>Abstract: The society produces textual data online in several ways, e.g., via reviews and social media posts. Therefore, numerous researchers have been working on discovering patterns in textual data that can indicate peoples' opinions, interests, etc. Most tasks regarding natural language processing are addressed using traditional machine learning methods and static datasets. This setting can lead to several problems, e.g., outdated datasets and models, which degrade in performance over time. This is particularly true regarding concept drift, in which the data distribution changes over time. Furthermore, text streaming scenarios also exhibit further challenges, such as the high speed at which data arrives over time. Models for stream scenarios must adhere to the aforementioned constraints while learning from the stream, thus storing texts for limited periods and consuming low memory. This study presents a systematic literature review regarding concept drift adaptation in text stream scenarios. Considering well-defined criteria, we selected 48 papers published between 2018 and August 2024 to unravel aspects such as text drift categories, detection types, model update mechanisms, stream mining tasks addressed, and text representation methods and their update mechanisms. Furthermore, we discussed drift visualization and simulation and listed real-world datasets used in the selected papers. Finally, we brought forward a discussion on existing works in the area, also highlighting open challenges and future research directions for the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture tailored for learning robust power system state representations, which strives to optimize power dispatch for the power flow adjustment across different transmission sections. Specifically, our proposed approach, named Powerformer, develops a dedicated section-adaptive attention mechanism, separating itself from the self-attention used in conventional transformers. This mechanism effectively integrates power system states with transmission section information, which facilitates the development of robust state representations. Furthermore, by considering the graph topology of power system and the electrical attributes of bus nodes, we introduce two customized strategies to further enhance the expressiveness: graph neural network propagation and multi-factor attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three power system scenarios, including the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a large-scale European system with 9241 buses, where Powerformer demonstrates its superior performance over several baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In drug discovery, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for protein-ligand binding provides a powerful tool for predicting binding affinities, estimating transport properties, and exploring pocket sites. There has been a long history of improving the efficiency of MD simulations through better numerical methods and, more recently, by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods. Yet, challenges remain, such as accurate modeling of extended-timescale simulations. To address this issue, we propose NeuralMD, the first ML surrogate that can facilitate numerical MD and provide accurate simulations in protein-ligand binding dynamics. We propose a principled approach that incorporates a novel physics-informed multi-grained group symmetric framework. Specifically, we propose (1) the BindingNet model that satisfies group symmetry using vector frames and captures the multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an augmented neural differential equation solver that learns the trajectory under Newtonian mechanics. For the experiment, we design ten single-trajectory and three multi-trajectory binding simulation tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of NeuralMD, achieving over 1K$\times$ speedup compared to standard numerical MD simulations. NeuralMD also outperforms all other ML approaches, achieving up to 15$\times$ reduction in reconstruction error and 70% increase in validity. Additionally, we qualitatively illustrate that the oscillations in the predicted trajectories align more closely with ground-truth dynamics than those of other machine-learning methods. We believe NeuralMD paves the foundation for a new research paradigm in simulating protein-ligand dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Given that no existing graph construction method can generate a perfect graph for a given dataset, graph-based algorithms are often affected by redundant and erroneous edges present within the constructed graphs. In this paper, we view these noisy edges as adversarial attack and propose to use a spectral adversarial robustness evaluation method to mitigate the impact of noisy edges on the performance of graph-based algorithms. Our method identifies the points that are less vulnerable to noisy edges and leverages only these robust points to perform graph-based algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that our methodology is highly effective and outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maysam Behmanesh, Maks Ovsjanikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aligns node representations by classifying node pairs into positives and negatives using a selection process that typically relies on establishing correspondences within two augmented graphs. The conventional GCL approaches incorporate negative samples uniformly in the contrastive loss, resulting in the equal treatment of negative nodes, regardless of their proximity to the true positive. In this paper, we present a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to inject proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in the contrastive loss, thus significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties associated with node pairs in contrastive loss by incorporating three distinct smoothing techniques that result in proximity-aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability for large-scale graphs, the proposed framework incorporates a graph batch-generating strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs, facilitating efficient training in separate batches. Through extensive experimentation in the unsupervised setting on various benchmarks, particularly those of large scale, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against recent baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although pre-trained transformers and reprogrammed text-based LLMs have shown strong performance on time series tasks, the best-performing architectures vary widely across tasks, with most models narrowly focused on specific areas, such as time series forecasting. Unifying predictive and generative time series tasks within a single model remains challenging. We introduce UniTS, a unified multi-task time series model that utilizes task tokenization to integrate predictive and generative tasks into a single framework. UniTS employs a modified transformer block to capture universal time series representations, enabling transferability from a heterogeneous, multi-domain pre-training dataset-characterized by diverse dynamic patterns, sampling rates, and temporal scales-to a wide range of downstream datasets with varied task specifications and data domains. Tested on 38 datasets across human activity sensors, healthcare, engineering, and finance, UniTS achieves superior performance compared to 12 forecasting models, 20 classification models, 18 anomaly detection models, and 16 imputation models, including adapted text-based LLMs. UniTS also demonstrates strong few-shot and prompt capabilities when applied to new domains and tasks. In single-task settings, UniTS outperforms competitive task-specialized time series models. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/mims-harvard/UniTS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Vitor Pamplona, Jan Pablo Burgard</p>
<p>Abstract: To ensure unbiased and ethical automated predictions, fairness must be a core principle in machine learning applications. Fairness in machine learning aims to mitigate biases present in the training data and model imperfections that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This is achieved by preventing the model from making decisions based on sensitive characteristics like ethnicity or sexual orientation. A fundamental assumption in machine learning is the independence of observations. However, this assumption often does not hold true for data describing social phenomena, where data points are often clustered based. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the cluster correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the cluster assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We present a fair mixed effects support vector machine algorithm that can handle both problems simultaneously. With a reproducible simulation study we demonstrate the impact of clustered data on the quality of fair machine learning predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Huang, Shatong Zhu, Junqiao Zhao, Hongtu Zhou, Chen Ye, Tiantian Feng, Changjun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Value function factorization methods are commonly used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, with QMIX receiving significant attention. Many QMIX-based methods introduce monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to achieve decentralized execution. However, such constraints limit the representation capacity of value factorization, restricting the joint action values it can represent and hindering the learning of the optimal policy. To address this challenge, we propose the Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighted QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns higher weights to the corresponding losses of these joint actions during training. We theoretically prove that with such a weighted training approach the optimal policy is guaranteed to be recovered. Experiments in matrix games, difficulty-enhanced predator-prey, and StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge environments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Mao Lai, Hsiang-Chun Wang, Ping-Chun Hsieh, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Min-Hung Chen, Shao-Hua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more robust and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator, and design diffusion rewards based on the classifier's output for policy learning. Extensive experiments are conducted in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL's effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more robust and smoother rewards. Project page: https://nturobotlearninglab.github.io/DRAIL/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Talaei, Mohammadreza Pourreza, Yu-Chen Chang, Azalia Mirhoseini, Amin Saberi</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL queries, known as text-to-SQL, is a long-standing research problem. Effective text-to-SQL synthesis can become very challenging due to (i) the extensive size of database catalogs (descriptions of tables and their columns) and database values, (ii) reasoning over large database schemas, (iii) ensuring the functional validity of the generated queries, and (iv) navigating the ambiguities of natural language questions. We introduce CHESS, a Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent framework for efficient and scalable SQL synthesis, comprising four specialized agents, each targeting one of the aforementioned challenges: the Information Retriever (IR) extracts relevant data, the Schema Selector (SS) prunes large schemas, the Candidate Generator (CG) generates high-quality candidates and refines queries iteratively, and the Unit Tester (UT) validates queries through LLM-based natural language unit tests. Our framework offers configurable features that adapt to various deployment constraints, including 1) Supporting industrial-scale databases: leveraging the Schema Selector agent, CHESS efficiently narrows down very large database schemas into manageable sub-schemas, boosting system accuracy by approximately $2\%$ and reducing the number of LLM tokens by $\times 5$. 2) State-of-the-Art privacy-preserving performance: Among the methods using open-source models, CHESS achieves state-of-the-art performance, resulting in a high-performing, privacy-preserving system suitable for industrial deployment. 3) Scalablity with additional compute budget: In settings with high computational budgets, CHESS achieves $71.10\%$ accuracy on the BIRD test set, within $2\%$ of the leading proprietary method, while requiring approximately $83\%$ fewer LLM calls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linglong Qian, Yiyuan Yang, Wenjie Du, Jun Wang, Zina Ibrahim</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series imputation is a critical challenge in data mining, particularly in domains like healthcare and environmental monitoring, where missing data can compromise analytical outcomes. This study investigates the influence of diverse masking strategies, normalization timing, and missingness patterns on the performance of eleven state-of-the-art imputation models across three diverse datasets. Specifically, we evaluate the effects of pre-masking versus in-mini-batch masking, augmentation versus overlaying of artificial missingness, and pre-normalization versus post-normalization. Our findings reveal that masking strategies profoundly affect imputation accuracy, with dynamic masking providing robust augmentation benefits and overlay masking better simulating real-world missingness patterns. Sophisticated models, such as CSDI, exhibited sensitivity to preprocessing configurations, while simpler models like BRITS delivered consistent and efficient performance. We highlight the importance of aligning preprocessing pipelines and masking strategies with dataset characteristics to improve robustness under diverse conditions, including high missing rates. This study provides actionable insights for designing imputation pipelines and underscores the need for transparent and comprehensive experimental designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Wu, Vardan Papyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) is a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where top-layer representations collapse into their class means, which become equinorm, equiangular and aligned with the classifiers. These behaviours -- associated with generalization and robustness -- would manifest under specific conditions: models are trained towards zero loss, with noise-free labels belonging to balanced classes, which do not outnumber the model's hidden dimension. Recent studies have explored $\mathcal{NC}$ in the absence of one or more of these conditions to extend and capitalize on the associated benefits of ideal geometries. Language modelling presents a curious frontier, as \textit{training by token prediction} constitutes a classification task where none of the conditions exist: the vocabulary is imbalanced and exceeds the embedding dimension; different tokens might correspond to similar contextual embeddings; and large language models (LLMs) in particular are typically only trained for a few epochs. This paper empirically investigates the impact of scaling the architectures and training of causal language models (CLMs) on their progression towards $\mathcal{NC}$. We find that $\mathcal{NC}$ properties that develop with scale (and regularization) are linked to generalization. Moreover, there is evidence of some relationship between $\mathcal{NC}$ and generalization independent of scale. Our work thereby underscores the generality of $\mathcal{NC}$ as it extends to the novel and more challenging setting of language modelling. Downstream, we seek to inspire further research on the phenomenon to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and neural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on $\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikun Ye, Hema Yoganarasimhan, Yufeng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern media firms require automated and efficient methods to identify content that is most engaging and appealing to users. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from Upworthy (a news publisher), which includes 17,681 headline A/B tests, we first investigate the ability of three pure-LLM approaches to identify the catchiest headline: prompt-based methods, embedding-based methods, and fine-tuned open-source LLMs. Prompt-based approaches perform poorly, while both OpenAI-embedding-based models and the fine-tuned Llama-3-8B achieve marginally higher accuracy than random predictions. In sum, none of the pure-LLM-based methods can predict the best-performing headline with high accuracy. We then introduce the LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm (LOLA), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with adaptive experimentation to optimize content delivery. LOLA combines the best pure-LLM approach with the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to allocate traffic and maximize clicks adaptively. Our numerical experiments on Upworthy data show that LOLA outperforms the standard A/B test method (the current status quo at Upworthy), pure bandit algorithms, and pure-LLM approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental traffic. Our approach is scalable and applicable to content experiments across various settings where firms seek to optimize user engagement, including digital advertising and social media recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yu Zhang, Yikang Shen, Yoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers with linear attention (i.e., linear transformers) and state-space models have recently been suggested as a viable linear-time alternative to transformers with softmax attention. However, these models still underperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-context retrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replace the additive update in linear transformers with the delta rule (DeltaNet) have been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithms for training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thus inefficient to train on modern hardware. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for training linear transformers with the delta rule, which exploits a memory-efficient representation for computing products of Householder matrices. This algorithm allows us to scale up DeltaNet to standard language modeling settings. We train a 1.3B model for 100B tokens and find that it outperforms recent linear-time baselines such as Mamba and GLA in terms of perplexity and zero-shot performance on downstream tasks. We also experiment with two hybrid models which combine DeltaNet layers with (1) sliding-window attention layers every other layer or (2) two global attention layers, and find that these hybrids outperform strong transformer baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Schrouff, Alexis Bellot, Amal Rannen-Triki, Alan Malek, Isabela Albuquerque, Arthur Gretton, Alexander D'Amour, Silvia Chiappa</p>
<p>Abstract: Failures of fairness or robustness in machine learning predictive settings can be due to undesired dependencies between covariates, outcomes and auxiliary factors of variation. A common strategy to mitigate these failures is data balancing, which attempts to remove those undesired dependencies. In this work, we define conditions on the training distribution for data balancing to lead to fair or robust models. Our results display that, in many cases, the balanced distribution does not correspond to selectively removing the undesired dependencies in a causal graph of the task, leading to multiple failure modes and even interference with other mitigation techniques such as regularization. Overall, our results highlight the importance of taking the causal graph into account before performing data balancing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Freitas, Jovan Kalajdjieski, Amir Gharib, Robert McCann</p>
<p>Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Microsoft Copilot for Security Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we release GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M incidents annotated with ground-truth triage labels by customer security analysts. This dataset represents the first large-scale cybersecurity resource of its kind, supporting the development and evaluation of guided response systems and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Curt Tigges, Michael Hanna, Qinan Yu, Stella Biderman</p>
<p>Abstract: Most currently deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo continuous training or additional finetuning. By contrast, most research into LLMs' internal mechanisms focuses on models at one snapshot in time (the end of pre-training), raising the question of whether their results generalize to real-world settings. Existing studies of mechanisms over time focus on encoder-only or toy models, which differ significantly from most deployed models. In this study, we track how model mechanisms, operationalized as circuits, emerge and evolve across 300 billion tokens of training in decoder-only LLMs, in models ranging from 70 million to 2.8 billion parameters. We find that task abilities and the functional components that support them emerge consistently at similar token counts across scale. Moreover, although such components may be implemented by different attention heads over time, the overarching algorithm that they implement remains. Surprisingly, both these algorithms and the types of components involved therein can replicate across model scale. These results suggest that circuit analyses conducted on small models at the end of pre-training can provide insights that still apply after additional pre-training and over model scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pirzada Suhail, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools across various applications, yet their decision-making process often remains opaque, leading to them being perceived as "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns about their interpretability and reliability, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Network inversion techniques offer a solution by allowing us to peek inside these black boxes, revealing the features and patterns learned by the networks behind their decision-making processes and thereby provide valuable insights into how neural networks arrive at their conclusions, making them more interpretable and trustworthy. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to network inversion using a meticulously conditioned generator that learns the data distribution in the input space of the trained neural network, enabling the reconstruction of inputs that would most likely lead to the desired outputs. To capture the diversity in the input space for a given output, instead of simply revealing the conditioning labels to the generator, we encode the conditioning label information into vectors and intermediate matrices and further minimize the cosine similarity between features of the generated images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Yang, Hanyu Zhang, Weimin Tan, Yuqi Sun, Bo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training medical foundation models on large-scale datasets demonstrate exceptional performance. However, recent research questions this traditional notion, exploring whether an increase in pre-training data always leads to enhanced model performance. To address this issue, data-effective learning approaches have been introduced to select valuable samples for foundation model pre-training. Notably, current methods in this area lack a clear standard for sample selection, and the underlying theoretical foundation remains unknown. As the first attempt to address this limitation, we leverage V-information in self-supervised pre-training of foundation models. Our theoretical derivation confirms that by optimizing V-information, sample selection can be framed as an optimization problem where choosing diverse and challenging samples enhances model performance even under limited training data. Under this guidance, we develop an optimal data-effective learning method (OptiDEL) to optimize V-information in real-world medical domains. The OptiDEL method generates more diverse and harder samples to achieve or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full dataset while using substantially less data. We compare the OptiDEL method with state-of-the-art approaches finding that OptiDEL consistently outperforms existing approaches across eight different datasets, with foundation models trained on only 5% of the pre-training data surpassing the performance of those trained on the full dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huifa Li, Jie Fu, Xinpeng Ling, Zhiyu Sun, Kuncan Wang, Zhili Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The swift advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the investigation of cellular-level tissue heterogeneity. Cell annotation significantly contributes to the extensive downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, The analysis of scRNA-seq for biological inference presents challenges owing to its intricate and indeterminate data distribution, characterized by a substantial volume and a high frequency of dropout events. Furthermore, the quality of training samples varies greatly, and the performance of the popular scRNA-seq data clustering solution GNN could be harmed by two types of low-quality training nodes: 1) nodes on the boundary; 2) nodes that contribute little additional information to the graph. To address these problems, we propose a single-cell curriculum learning-based deep graph embedding clustering (scCLG). We first propose a Chebyshev graph convolutional autoencoder with multi-decoder (ChebAE) that combines three optimization objectives corresponding to three decoders, including topology reconstruction loss of cell graphs, zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss, and clustering loss, to learn cell-cell topology representation. Meanwhile, we employ a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the features and entropy of nodes and prune the difficult nodes based on the difficulty scores to keep the high-quality graph. Empirical results on a variety of gene expression datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchang Sun, Yuexiang Xie, Bolin Ding, Yaliang Li, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for fine-tuning foundation models using distributed data in a privacy-preserving manner. Under limited computational resources, clients often find it more practical to fine-tune a selected subset of layers, rather than the entire model, based on their task-specific data. In this study, we provide a thorough theoretical exploration of selective layer fine-tuning in FL, emphasizing a flexible approach that allows the clients to adjust their selected layers according to their local data and resources. We theoretically demonstrate that the layer selection strategy has a significant impact on model convergence in two critical aspects: the importance of selected layers and the heterogeneous choices across clients. Drawing from these insights, we further propose a strategic layer selection method that utilizes local gradients and regulates layer selections across clients. The extensive experiments on both image and text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy compared with several baselines, highlighting its advances in identifying critical layers that adapt to the client heterogeneity and training dynamics in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexei Pisacane, Victor-Alexandru Darvariu, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph path search is a classic computer science problem that has been recently approached with Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to its potential to outperform prior methods. Existing RL techniques typically assume a global view of the network, which is not suitable for large-scale, dynamic, and privacy-sensitive settings. An area of particular interest is search in social networks due to its numerous applications. Inspired by seminal work in experimental sociology, which showed that decentralized yet efficient search is possible in social networks, we frame the problem as a collaborative task between multiple agents equipped with a limited local view of the network. We propose a multi-agent approach for graph path search that successfully leverages both homophily and structural heterogeneity. Our experiments, carried out over synthetic and real-world social networks, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms learned and heuristic baselines. Furthermore, our results show that meaningful embeddings for graph navigation can be constructed using reward-driven learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Buffelli, Farzin Soleymani, Bastian Rieck</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks have become the default choice by practitioners for graph learning tasks such as graph classification and node classification. Nevertheless, popular graph neural network models still struggle to capture higher-order information, i.e., information that goes \emph{beyond} pairwise interactions. Recent work has shown that persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, can enrich graph neural networks with topological information that they otherwise could not capture. Calculating such features is efficient for dimension 0 (connected components) and dimension 1 (cycles). However, when it comes to higher-order structures, it does not scale well, with a complexity of $O(n^d)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $d$ is the order of the structures. In this work, we introduce a novel method that extracts information about higher-order structures in the graph while still using the efficient low-dimensional persistent homology algorithm. On standard benchmark datasets, we show that our method can lead to up to $31\%$ improvements in test accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lyudong Jin, Ming Tang, Jiayu Pan, Meng Zhang, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of emerging real-time networked applications like cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Age of Information (AoI) has merged as a pivotal metric for evaluating the timeliness. To meet the high computational demands, such as those in intelligent manufacturing within CPS, mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising solution for optimizing computing and reducing AoI. In this work, we study the timeliness of computational-intensive updates and explores jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies to minimize AoI. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The fractional objective introduced by AoI and the semi-Markov game nature of the problem render this challenge particularly difficult, with existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework to fractional reinforcement learning (RL). We first introduce a fractional single-agent RL framework and prove its linear convergence. We then extend this to a fractional multi-agent RL framework with a convergence analysis. To tackle the challenge of asynchronous control in semi-Markov game, we further design an asynchronous model-free fractional multi-agent RL algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 52.6% compared with the best baseline algorithm in our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenao Zhang, Zhihan Liu, Zhaoran Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models. Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks. When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rory Young, Nicolas Pugeault</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of simulated control tasks. However, successful applications to real-world problems remain limited. One reason for this dichotomy is because the learnt policies are not robust to observation noise or adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of deep RL policies to a single small state perturbation in deterministic continuous control tasks. We demonstrate that RL policies can be deterministically chaotic, as small perturbations to the system state have a large impact on subsequent state and reward trajectories. This unstable non-linear behaviour has two consequences: first, inaccuracies in sensor readings, or adversarial attacks, can cause significant performance degradation; second, even policies that show robust performance in terms of rewards may have unpredictable behaviour in practice. These two facets of chaos in RL policies drastically restrict the application of deep RL to real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose an improvement on the successful Dreamer V3 architecture, implementing Maximal Lyapunov Exponent regularisation. This new approach reduces the chaotic state dynamics, rendering the learnt policies more resilient to sensor noise or adversarial attacks and thereby improving the suitability of deep reinforcement learning for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Wang, Yongxin Guo, Xiaoying Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that can effectively generalize to unseen domains. However, in the context of Federated Learning (FL), where clients collaboratively train a model without directly sharing their data, most existing DG algorithms are not directly applicable to the FL setting due to privacy constraints, as well as the limited data quantity and domain diversity at each client. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCCRL, a lightweight federated domain generalization method that significantly improves the model's generalization ability while preserving privacy and ensuring computational and communication efficiency. Specifically, FedCCRL comprises two principal modules: the first is a cross-client feature extension module, which increases local domain diversity via cross-client domain transfer and domain-invariant feature perturbation; the second is a representation and prediction dual-stage alignment module, which enables the model to effectively capture domain-invariant features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedCCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the PACS, OfficeHome and miniDomainNet datasets across FL settings of varying numbers of clients.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shpresim Sadiku, Moritz Wagner, Sai Ganesh Nagarajan, Sebastian Pokutta</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of finding optimal sparse, manifold-aligned counterfactual explanations for classifiers. Canonically, this can be formulated as an optimization problem with multiple non-convex components, including classifier loss functions and manifold alignment (or \emph{plausibility}) metrics. The added complexity of enforcing \emph{sparsity}, or shorter explanations, complicates the problem further. Existing methods often focus on specific models and plausibility measures, relying on convex $\ell_1$ regularizers to enforce sparsity. In this paper, we tackle the canonical formulation using the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method, a simple yet efficient first-order procedure capable of handling smooth non-convex objectives and non-smooth $\ell_p$ (where $0 \leq p < 1$) regularizers. This enables our approach to seamlessly incorporate various classifiers and plausibility measures while producing sparser solutions. Our algorithm only requires differentiable data-manifold regularizers and supports box constraints for bounded feature ranges, ensuring the generated counterfactuals remain \emph{actionable}. Finally, experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively produces sparse, manifold-aligned counterfactual explanations while maintaining proximity to the factual data and computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dual-target therapeutic strategies have become a compelling approach and attracted significant attention due to various benefits, such as their potential in overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. Considering the tremendous success that deep generative models have achieved in structure-based drug design in recent years, we formulate dual-target drug design as a generative task and curate a novel dataset of potential target pairs based on synergistic drug combinations. We propose to design dual-target drugs with diffusion models that are trained on single-target protein-ligand complex pairs. Specifically, we align two pockets in 3D space with protein-ligand binding priors and build two complex graphs with shared ligand nodes for SE(3)-equivariant composed message passing, based on which we derive a composed drift in both 3D and categorical probability space in the generative process. Our algorithm can well transfer the knowledge gained in single-target pretraining to dual-target scenarios in a zero-shot manner. We also repurpose linker design methods as strong baselines for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with various baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that achieves a globally robust model through decentralized computation and periodic model synthesis, primarily focusing on the global model's accuracy over aggregated datasets of all participating clients. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) instead tailors exclusive models for each client, aiming to enhance the accuracy of clients' individual models on specific local data distributions. Despite of their wide adoption, existing FL and PFL works have yet to comprehensively address the class-imbalance issue, one of the most critical challenges within the realm of data heterogeneity in PFL and FL research. In this paper, we propose FedReMa, an efficient PFL algorithm that can tackle class-imbalance by 1) utilizing an adaptive inter-client co-learning approach to identify and harness different clients' expertise on different data classes throughout various phases of the training process, and 2) employing distinct aggregation methods for clients' feature extractors and classifiers, with the choices informed by the different roles and implications of these model components. Specifically, driven by our experimental findings on inter-client similarity dynamics, we develop critical co-learning period (CCP), wherein we introduce a module named maximum difference segmentation (MDS) to assess and manage task relevance by analyzing the similarities between clients' logits of their classifiers. Outside the CCP, we employ an additional scheme for model aggregation that utilizes historical records of each client's most relevant peers to further enhance the personalization stability. We demonstrate the superiority of our FedReMa in extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Nicolas, C\'esar Sabater, Mohamed Maouche, Sonia Ben Mokhtar, Mark Coates</p>
<p>Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. As modern datasets contain sensitive private information, we need to give formal guarantees on the possible privacy leaks caused by this method. This paper focuses on enhancing privacy preserving variants of the method. We propose a strategy to reduce the variance of the noise introduced to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). We also adapt the method to a decentralized framework with a low computational and communication overhead, while preserving the accuracy. We leverage Secure Aggregation (a form of Multi-Party Computation) to allow the algorithm to perform computations using data distributed among multiple users or devices, without revealing individual data. We show that it is possible to use a noise scale in the decentralized setting that is similar to the one in the centralized setting. We improve upon existing convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions. The proposed method is especially relevant for decentralized applications such as distributed recommender systems, where privacy concerns are paramount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wojciech {\L}apacz, Daniel Marczak, Filip Szatkowski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a critical area in machine learning, enabling neural networks to learn from evolving data distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, recent research has identified the stability gap -- a phenomenon where models initially lose performance on previously learned tasks before partially recovering during training. Such learning dynamics are contradictory to the intuitive understanding of stability in continual learning where one would expect the performance to degrade gradually instead of rapidly decreasing and then partially recovering later. To better understand and alleviate the stability gap, we investigate it at different levels of the neural network architecture, particularly focusing on the role of the classification head. We introduce the nearest-mean classifier (NMC) as a tool to attribute the influence of the backbone and the classification head on the stability gap. Our experiments demonstrate that NMC not only improves final performance, but also significantly enhances training stability across various continual learning benchmarks, including CIFAR100, ImageNet100, CUB-200, and FGVC Aircrafts. Moreover, we find that NMC also reduces task-recency bias. Our analysis provides new insights into the stability gap and suggests that the primary contributor to this phenomenon is the linear head, rather than the insufficient representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Levi Rauchwerger, Stefanie Jegelka, Ron Levie</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze the universality and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on attributed graphs, i.e., with node attributes. To this end, we propose pseudometrics over the space of all attributed graphs that describe the fine-grained expressivity of GNNs. Namely, GNNs are both Lipschitz continuous with respect to our pseudometrics and can separate attributed graphs that are distant in the metric. Moreover, we prove that the space of all attributed graphs is relatively compact with respect to our metrics. Based on these properties, we prove a universal approximation theorem for GNNs and generalization bounds for GNNs on any data distribution of attributed graphs. The proposed metrics compute the similarity between the structures of attributed graphs via a hierarchical optimal transport between computation trees. Our work extends and unites previous approaches which either derived theory only for graphs with no attributes, derived compact metrics under which GNNs are continuous but without separation power, or derived metrics under which GNNs are continuous and separate points but the space of graphs is not relatively compact, which prevents universal approximation and generalization analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Herrmann, Dylan R. Ashley, J\"urgen Schmidhuber</p>
<p>Abstract: Album sequencing is a critical part of the album production process. Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed that sequences general collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of the items in the collections. While this approach implies an album sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of templates available to the user and address shortcomings of previous work, we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user interface, and this -- alongside a full copy of our implementation -- is publicly available at https://github.com/dylanashley/automatic-album-sequencing</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam P. Generale, Andreas E. Robertson, Surya R. Kalidindi</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems under the influence of conditioning variables is a fundamental challenge repeatedly encountered across the biological and physical sciences. While flow-based models can impressively predict the temporal evolution of probability distributions representing possible outcomes of a specific process, existing frameworks cannot satisfactorily account for the impact of conditioning variables on these dynamics. Amongst several limitations, existing methods require training data with paired conditions and are developed for discrete conditioning variables. We propose Conditional Variable Flow Matching (CVFM), a framework for learning flows transforming conditional distributions with amortization across continuous conditioning variables - permitting predictions across the conditional density manifold. This is accomplished through several novel advances. In particular, simultaneous sample conditioned flows over the main and conditioning variables. In addition, motivated by theoretical analysis, a conditional Wasserstein distance combined with a loss reweighting kernel facilitating conditional optimal transport. Collectively, these advances allow for learning system dynamics provided measurement data whose states and conditioning variables are not in correspondence. We demonstrate CVFM on a suite of increasingly challenging problems, including discrete and continuous conditional mapping benchmarks, image-to-image domain transfer, and modeling the temporal evolution of materials internal structure during manufacturing processes. We observe that CVFM results in improved performance and convergence characteristics over alternative conditional variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qin Jiang, Chengjia Wang, Michael Lones, Yingfang Yuan, Wei Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have advanced relational data analysis but lack invariance learning techniques common in image classification. In node classification with GNNs, it is actually the ego-graph of the center node that is classified. This research extends the scale invariance concept to node classification by drawing an analogy to image processing: just as scale invariance being used in image classification to capture multi-scale features, we propose the concept of ``scaled ego-graphs''. Scaled ego-graphs generalize traditional ego-graphs by replacing undirected single-edges with ``scaled-edges'', which are ordered sequences of multiple directed edges. We empirically assess the performance of the proposed scale invariance in graphs on seven benchmark datasets, across both homophilic and heterophilic structures. Our scale-invariance-based graph learning outperforms inception models derived from random walks by being simpler, faster, and more accurate. The scale invariance explains inception models' success on homophilic graphs and limitations on heterophilic graphs. To ensure applicability of inception model to heterophilic graphs as well, we further present ScaleNet, an architecture that leverages multi-scaled features. ScaleNet achieves state-of-the-art results on five out of seven datasets (four homophilic and one heterophilic) and matches top performance on the remaining two, demonstrating its excellent applicability. This represents a significant advance in graph learning, offering a unified framework that enhances node classification across various graph types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lechao Cheng, Kaifeng Chen, Jiyang Li, Shengeng Tang, Shufei Zhang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from noisy data has become essential for adapting deep learning models to real-world applications. Traditional methods often involve first evaluating the noise and then applying strategies such as discarding noisy samples, re-weighting, or re-labeling. However, these methods can fall into a vicious cycle when the initial noise evaluation is inaccurate, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages dataset distillation for noise removal. This method avoids the feedback loop common in existing techniques and enhances training efficiency, while also providing strong privacy protection through offline processing. We rigorously evaluate three representative dataset distillation methods (DATM, DANCE, and RCIG) under various noise conditions, including symmetric noise, asymmetric noise, and real-world natural noise. Our empirical findings reveal that dataset distillation effectively serves as a denoising tool in random noise scenarios but may struggle with structured asymmetric noise patterns, which can be absorbed into the distilled samples. Additionally, clean but challenging samples, such as those from tail classes in imbalanced datasets, may undergo lossy compression during distillation. Despite these challenges, our results highlight that dataset distillation holds significant promise for robust model training, especially in high-privacy environments where noise is prevalent.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyi Li, Wenjie Mei, Ke Yu, Yang Bai, Shihua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning models of dynamical systems with external inputs, that may be, for example, nonsmooth or piecewise, is crucial for studying complex phenomena and predicting future state evolution, which is essential for applications such as safety guarantees and decision-making. In this work, we introduce \emph{Input Concomitant Neural ODEs (ICODEs)}, which incorporate precise real-time input information into the learning process of the models, rather than treating the inputs as hidden parameters to be learned. The sufficient conditions to ensure the model's contraction property are provided to guarantee that system trajectories of the trained model converge to a fixed point, regardless of initial conditions across different training processes. We validate our method through experiments on several representative real dynamics: Single-link robot, DC-to-DC converter, motion dynamics of a rigid body, Rabinovich-Fabrikant equation, Glycolytic-glycogenolytic pathway model, and heat conduction equation. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ICODEs efficiently learn the ground truth systems, achieving superior prediction performance under both typical and atypical inputs. This work offers a valuable class of neural ODE models for understanding physical systems with explicit external input information, with potential promising applications in fields such as physics and robotics.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this position paper, we propose an approach for sustainable data collection in the field of optimal mix design for marble sludge reuse. Marble sludge, a calcium-rich residual from stone-cutting processes, can be repurposed by mixing it with various ingredients. However, determining the optimal mix design is challenging due to the variability in sludge composition and the costly, time-consuming nature of experimental data collection. Also, we investigate the possibility of using machine learning models using meta-learning as an optimization tool to estimate the correct quantity of stone-cutting sludge to be used in aggregates to obtain a mix design with specific mechanical properties that can be used successfully in the building industry. Our approach offers two key advantages: (i) through simulations, a large dataset can be generated, saving time and money during the data collection phase, and (ii) Utilizing machine learning models, with performance enhancement through hyper-parameter optimization via meta-learning, to estimate optimal mix designs reducing the need for extensive manual experimentation, lowering costs, minimizing environmental impact, and accelerating the processing of quarry sludge. Our idea promises to streamline the marble sludge reuse process by leveraging collective data and advanced machine learning, promoting sustainability and efficiency in the stonecutting sector.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate short-term energy consumption forecasting for commercial buildings is crucial for smart grid operations. While smart meters and deep learning models enable forecasting using past data from multiple buildings, data heterogeneity from diverse buildings can reduce model performance. The impact of increasing dataset heterogeneity in time series forecasting, while keeping size and model constant, is understudied. We tackle this issue using the ComStock dataset, which provides synthetic energy consumption data for U.S. commercial buildings. Two curated subsets, identical in size and region but differing in building type diversity, are used to assess the performance of various time series forecasting models, including fine-tuned open-source foundation models (FMs). The results show that dataset heterogeneity and model architecture have a greater impact on post-training forecasting performance than the parameter count. Moreover, despite the higher computational cost, fine-tuned FMs demonstrate competitive performance compared to base models trained from scratch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust medical Machine Learning (ML) models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by accelerating clinical research, improving workflows and outcomes, and producing novel insights or capabilities. Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, we introduce Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications. The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. In addition, we utilize a common interface and style across these models, and prioritize usability to enable developers to integrate HAI-DEF efficiently. We present model evaluations across various tasks and conclude with a discussion of their application and evaluation, covering the importance of ensuring efficacy, fairness, and equity. Finally, while HAI-DEF and specifically the foundation models lower the barrier to entry for ML in healthcare, we emphasize the importance of validation with problem- and population-specific data for each desired usage setting. This technical report will be updated over time as more modalities and features are added.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wearable accelerometry (actigraphy) has provided valuable data for clinical insights since the 1970s and is increasingly important as wearable devices continue to become widespread. The effectiveness of actigraphy in research and clinical contexts is heavily dependent on the modeling architecture utilized. To address this, we developed the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT)--the first pretrained and fully attention-based model designed specifically to handle actigraphy. PAT was pretrained on actigraphy from 29,307 participants in NHANES, enabling it to deliver state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned across various actigraphy prediction tasks in the mental health domain, even in data-limited scenarios. For example, when trained to predict benzodiazepine usage using actigraphy from only 500 labeled participants, PAT achieved an 8.8 percentage-point AUC improvement over the best baseline. With fewer than 2 million parameters and built-in model explainability, PAT is robust yet easy to deploy in health research settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingshuo Han, Xuanye Zhang, Xiang Lan, Haozhao Wang, Shengmin Xu, Shen Ren, Jason Zeng, Ming Wu, Michael Heinrich, Tianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the training of deep learning models on distributed clients to preserve data privacy. However, this learning paradigm is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients can upload poisoned local models to embed backdoors into the global model, leading to attacker-desired predictions. Existing backdoor attacks mainly focus on FL with independently and identically distributed (IID) scenarios, while real-world FL training data are typically non-IID. Current strategies for non-IID backdoor attacks suffer from limitations in maintaining effectiveness and durability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backdoor attack method, BadSFL, specifically designed for the FL framework using the scaffold aggregation algorithm in non-IID settings. BadSFL leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based on the global model to complement the training set, achieving high accuracy on both backdoor and benign samples. It utilizes a specific feature as the backdoor trigger to ensure stealthiness, and exploits the Scaffold's control variate to predict the global model's convergence direction, ensuring the backdoor's persistence. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the high effectiveness, stealthiness, and durability of BadSFL. Notably, our attack remains effective over 60 rounds in the global model and up to 3 times longer than existing baseline attacks after stopping the injection of malicious updates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most popular and flexible approaches in data science allowing to represent probability measures without loss of information under mild conditions. The resulting mapping called mean embedding gives rise to a divergence measure referred to as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with existing quadratic-time estimators (w.r.t. the sample size) and known convergence properties for bounded kernels. In this paper we focus on the problem of MMD estimation when the mean embedding of one of the underlying distributions is available analytically. Particularly, we consider distributions on the real line (motivated by financial applications) and prove tighter concentration for the proposed estimator under this semi-explicit setting; we also extend the result to the case of unbounded (exponential) kernel with minimax-optimal lower bounds. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach beyond synthetic example in three real-world examples relying on one-dimensional random variables: index replication and calibration on loss-given-default ratios and on S&P 500 data.</p>

<p>Abstract: By folding to particular 3D structures, proteins play a key role in living beings. To learn meaningful representation from a protein structure for downstream tasks, not only the global backbone topology but the local fine-grained orientational relations between amino acids should also be considered. In this work, we propose the Orientation-Aware Graph Neural Networks (OAGNNs) to better sense the geometric characteristics in protein structure (e.g. inner-residue torsion angles, inter-residue orientations). Extending a single weight from a scalar to a 3D vector, we construct a rich set of geometric-meaningful operations to process both the classical and SO(3) representations of a given structure. To plug our designed perceptron unit into existing Graph Neural Networks, we further introduce an equivariant message passing paradigm, showing superior versatility in maintaining SO(3)-equivariance at the global scale. Experiments have shown that our OAGNNs have a remarkable ability to sense geometric orientational features compared to classical networks. OAGNNs have also achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computational biology applications related to protein 3D structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Federated Learning, it is crucial to handle low-quality, corrupted, or malicious data. However, traditional data valuation methods are not suitable due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach that utilizes a new influence approximation called "lazy influence" to filter and score data while preserving privacy. To do this, each participant uses their own data to estimate the influence of another participant's batch and sends a differentially private obfuscated score to the central coordinator. Our method has been shown to successfully filter out biased and corrupted data in various simulated and real-world settings, achieving a recall rate of over $>90\%$ (sometimes up to $100\%$) while maintaining strong differential privacy guarantees with $\varepsilon \leq 1$.</p>

The iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm for obtaining an $\epsilon$-stationary point is analyzed under mild assumptions. Existing ADMM for solving nonconvex problems either does not allow nonconvex constraint set, or does not allow nonsmooth objective function. Our algorithm is the first ADMM type algorithm that minimizes a nonsmooth objective over manifold -- a particular nonconvex set.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Geuchen, Thomas Jahn, Hannes Matt</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the universality of complex-valued neural networks with bounded widths and arbitrary depths. Under mild assumptions, we give a full description of those activation functions $\varrho:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ that have the property that their associated networks are universal, i.e., are capable of approximating continuous functions to arbitrary accuracy on compact domains. Precisely, we show that deep narrow complex-valued networks are universal if and only if their activation function is neither holomorphic, nor antiholomorphic, nor $\mathbb{R}$-affine. This is a much larger class of functions than in the dual setting of arbitrary width and fixed depth. Unlike in the real case, the sufficient width differs significantly depending on the considered activation function. We show that a width of $2n+2m+5$ is always sufficient and that in general a width of $max\{2n,2m\}$ is necessary. We prove, however, that a width of $n+m+3$ suffices for a rich subclass of the admissible activation functions. Here, $n$ and $m$ denote the input and output dimensions of the considered networks. Moreover, for the case of smooth and non-polyharmonic activation functions, we provide a quantitative approximation bound in terms of the depth of the considered networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even outperform GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of all, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL (M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biological and artificial information processing systems form representations of the world that they can use to categorize, reason, plan, navigate, and make decisions. How can we measure the similarity between the representations formed by these diverse systems? Do similarities in representations then translate into similar behavior? If so, then how can a system's representations be modified to better match those of another system? These questions pertaining to the study of representational alignment are at the heart of some of the most promising research areas in contemporary cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. In this Perspective, we survey the exciting recent developments in representational alignment research in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. Despite their overlapping interests, there is limited knowledge transfer between these fields, so work in one field ends up duplicated in another, and useful innovations are not shared effectively. To improve communication, we propose a unifying framework that can serve as a common language for research on representational alignment, and map several streams of existing work across fields within our framework. We also lay out open problems in representational alignment where progress can benefit all three of these fields. We hope that this paper will catalyze cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress for all communities studying and developing information processing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqing Li, Diego Klabjan, Jean Utke</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new, unsupervised method for automatic video summarization using ideas from generative adversarial networks but eliminating the discriminator, having a simple loss function, and separating training of different parts of the model. An iterative training strategy is also applied by alternately training the reconstructor and the frame selector for multiple iterations. Furthermore, a trainable mask vector is added to the model in summary generation during training and evaluation. The method also includes an unsupervised model selection algorithm. Results from experiments on two public datasets (SumMe and TVSum) and four datasets we created (Soccer, LoL, MLB, and ShortMLB) demonstrate the effectiveness of each component on the model performance, particularly the iterative training strategy. Evaluations and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods highlight the advantages of the proposed method in performance, stability, and training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Fu, Huandong Wang, Chen Gao, Guanghua Liu, Yong Li, Tao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to infer whether a target data record has been utilized for model training or not. Existing MIAs designed for large language models (LLMs) can be bifurcated into two types: reference-free and reference-based attacks. Although reference-based attacks appear promising performance by calibrating the probability measured on the target model with reference models, this illusion of privacy risk heavily depends on a reference dataset that closely resembles the training set. Both two types of attacks are predicated on the hypothesis that training records consistently maintain a higher probability of being sampled. However, this hypothesis heavily relies on the overfitting of target models, which will be mitigated by multiple regularization methods and the generalization of LLMs. Thus, these reasons lead to high false-positive rates of MIAs in practical scenarios. We propose a Membership Inference Attack based on Self-calibrated Probabilistic Variation (SPV-MIA). Specifically, we introduce a self-prompt approach, which constructs the dataset to fine-tune the reference model by prompting the target LLM itself. In this manner, the adversary can collect a dataset with a similar distribution from public APIs. Furthermore, we introduce probabilistic variation, a more reliable membership signal based on LLM memorization rather than overfitting, from which we rediscover the neighbour attack with theoretical grounding. Comprehensive evaluation conducted on three datasets and four exemplary LLMs shows that SPV-MIA raises the AUC of MIAs from 0.7 to a significantly high level of 0.9.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Veronica Piccialli, Jan Schwiddessen, Antonio M. Sudoso</p>
<p>Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) are well-studied supervised learning models for binary classification. In many applications, large amounts of samples can be cheaply and easily obtained. What is often a costly and error-prone process is to manually label these instances. Semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs) extend the well-known SVM classifiers to the semi-supervised approach, aiming at maximizing the margin between samples in the presence of unlabeled data. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, S3VMs attempt to achieve better accuracy and robustness compared to traditional SVMs. Unfortunately, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and hence difficult to solve exactly. In this paper, we present a new branch-and-cut approach for S3VMs using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. We apply optimality-based bound tightening to bound the feasible set. Box constraints allow us to include valid inequalities, strengthening the lower bound. The resulting SDP relaxation provides bounds significantly stronger than the ones available in the literature. For the upper bound, instead, we define a local search exploiting the solution of the SDP relaxation. Computational results highlight the efficiency of the algorithm, showing its capability to solve instances with a number of data points 10 times larger than the ones solved in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamish Haggerty, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Early cancer detection is crucial for prognosis, but many cancer types lack large labelled datasets required for developing deep learning models. This paper investigates self-supervised learning (SSL) as an alternative to the standard supervised pre-training on ImageNet for scenarios with limited training data using a deep learning model (ResNet-50). We first demonstrate that SSL pre-training on ImageNet (via the Barlow Twins SSL algorithm) outperforms supervised pre-training (SL) using a skin lesion dataset with limited training samples. We then consider \textit{further} SSL pre-training (of the two ImageNet pre-trained models) on task-specific datasets, where our implementation is motivated by supervised transfer learning. This approach significantly enhances initially SL pre-trained models, closing the performance gap with initially SSL pre-trained ones. Surprisingly, further pre-training on just the limited fine-tuning data achieves this performance equivalence. Linear probe experiments reveal that improvement stems from enhanced feature extraction. Hence, we find that minimal further SSL pre-training on task-specific data can be as effective as large-scale SSL pre-training on ImageNet for medical image classification tasks with limited labelled data. We validate these results on an oral cancer histopathology dataset, suggesting broader applicability across medical imaging domains facing labelled data scarcity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang-Won Lee, Yuzhe Qin, Xiaolong Wang, Soo-Chul Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: The sense of touch is an essential ability for skillfully performing a variety of tasks, providing the capacity to search and manipulate objects without relying on visual information. In this paper, we introduce a multi-finger robot system designed to manipulate objects using the sense of touch, without relying on vision. For tasks that mimic daily life, the robot uses its sense of touch to manipulate randomly placed objects in dark. The objective of this study is to enable robots to perform blind manipulation by using tactile sensation to compensate for the information gap caused by the absence of vision, given the presence of prior information. Training the policy through reinforcement learning in simulation and transferring the trained policy to the real environment, we demonstrate that blind manipulation can be applied to robots without vision. In addition, the experiments showcase the importance of tactile sensing in the blind manipulation tasks. Our project page is available at https://lee-kangwon.github.io/dextouch/</p>

<p>Abstract: Although Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) on one hand and the policy gradient approach on the other hand are among the most used frameworks of Reinforcement Learning, the theoretical properties of the policy gradient algorithm used for MAB have not been given enough attention. We investigate in this work the convergence of such a procedure for the situation when a $L2$ regularization term is present jointly with the 'softmax' parametrization. We prove convergence under appropriate technical hypotheses and test numerically the procedure including situations beyond the theoretical setting. The tests show that a time dependent regularized procedure can improve over the canonical approach especially when the initial guess is far from the solution.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents BioNeRF, a biologically plausible architecture that models scenes in a 3D representation and synthesizes new views through radiance fields. Since NeRF relies on the network weights to store the scene's 3-dimensional representation, BioNeRF implements a cognitive-inspired mechanism that fuses inputs from multiple sources into a memory-like structure, improving the storing capacity and extracting more intrinsic and correlated information. BioNeRF also mimics a behavior observed in pyramidal cells concerning contextual information, in which the memory is provided as the context and combined with the inputs of two subsequent neural models, one responsible for producing the volumetric densities and the other the colors used to render the scene. Experimental results show that BioNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art results concerning a quality measure that encodes human perception in two datasets: real-world images and synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ri-Zhao Qiu, Yafei Hu, Yuchen Song, Ge Yang, Yang Fu, Jianglong Ye, Jiteng Mu, Ruihan Yang, Nikolay Atanasov, Sebastian Scherer, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: An open problem in mobile manipulation is how to represent objects and scenes in a unified manner so that robots can use both for navigation and manipulation. The latter requires capturing intricate geometry while understanding fine-grained semantics, whereas the former involves capturing the complexity inherent at an expansive physical scale. In this work, we present GeFF (Generalizable Feature Fields), a scene-level generalizable neural feature field that acts as a unified representation for both navigation and manipulation that performs in real-time. To do so, we treat generative novel view synthesis as a pre-training task, and then align the resulting rich scene priors with natural language via CLIP feature distillation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by deploying GeFF on a quadrupedal robot equipped with a manipulator. We quantitatively evaluate GeFF's ability for open-vocabulary object-/part-level manipulation and show that GeFF outperforms point-based baselines in runtime and storage-accuracy trade-offs, with qualitative examples of semantics-aware navigation and articulated object manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyi Lin, Ning Sun, Pallab Bhattacharya, Xizhou Feng, Louis Feng, John D. Owens</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing and predicting the training performance of modern machine learning (ML) workloads on compute systems with compute and communication spread between CPUs, GPUs, and network devices is not only the key to optimization and planning but also a complex goal to achieve. The primary challenges include the complexity of synchronization and load balancing between CPUs and GPUs, the variance in input data distribution, and the use of different communication devices and topologies (e.g., NVLink, PCIe, network cards) that connect multiple compute devices, coupled with the desire for flexible training configurations. Built on top of our prior work for single-GPU platforms, we address these challenges and enable multi-GPU performance modeling by incorporating (1) data-distribution-aware performance models for embedding table lookup, and (2) data movement prediction of communication collectives, into our upgraded performance modeling pipeline equipped with inter-and intra-rank synchronization for ML workloads trained on multi-GPU platforms. Beyond accurately predicting the per-iteration training time of DLRM models with random configurations with a geomean error of 5.21% on two multi-GPU platforms, our prediction pipeline generalizes well to other types of ML workloads, such as Transformer-based NLP models with a geomean error of 3.00%. Moreover, even without actually running ML workloads like DLRMs on the hardware, it is capable of generating insights such as quickly selecting the fastest embedding table sharding configuration (with a success rate of 85%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junpu Wang, Guili Xu, Chunlei Li, Guangshuai Gao, Yuehua Cheng, Bing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection using only normal samples is of great significance for quality inspection in industrial manufacturing. Although existing reconstruction-based methods have achieved promising results, they still face two problems: poor distinguishable information in image reconstruction and well abnormal regeneration caused by model under-regularization. To overcome the above issues, we convert the image reconstruction into a combination of parallel feature restorations and propose a multi-feature reconstruction network, MFRNet, using crossed-mask restoration in this paper. Specifically, a multi-scale feature aggregator is first developed to generate more discriminative hierarchical representations of the input images from a pre-trained model. Subsequently, a crossed-mask generator is adopted to randomly cover the extracted feature map, followed by a restoration network based on the transformer structure for high-quality repair of the missing regions. Finally, a hybrid loss is equipped to guide model training and anomaly estimation, which gives consideration to both the pixel and structural similarity. Extensive experiments show that our method is highly competitive with or significantly outperforms other state-of-the-arts on four public available datasets and one self-made dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Waida, Kimihiro Yamazaki, Atsushi Tokuhisa, Mutsuyo Wada, Yuichiro Wada</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning for image denoising problems in the presence of denaturation for noisy data is a crucial approach in machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Li, Jing Dong, Tianxing He, Jingzhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Legal systems worldwide are inundated with exponential growth in cases and documents. There is an imminent need to develop NLP and ML techniques for automatically processing and understanding legal documents to streamline the legal system. However, evaluating and comparing various NLP models designed specifically for the legal domain is challenging. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing IL-TUR: Benchmark for Indian Legal Text Understanding and Reasoning. IL-TUR contains monolingual (English, Hindi) and multi-lingual (9 Indian languages) domain-specific tasks that address different aspects of the legal system from the point of view of understanding and reasoning over Indian legal documents. We present baseline models (including LLM-based) for each task, outlining the gap between models and the ground truth. To foster further research in the legal domain, we create a leaderboard (available at: https://exploration-lab.github.io/IL-TUR/) where the research community can upload and compare legal text understanding systems.</p>

Our experiments show that our implementation performs up to about 244.5 times faster than OpenSpiel's Python implementation and, on an expanded set of games, up to about 114.2 times faster than OpenSpiel's C++ implementation and the speedup becomes more pronounced as the size of the game being solved grows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals hold significant potential for gesture recognition and robust prosthetic hand development. However, sEMG signals are affected by various physiological and dynamic factors, including forearm orientation, electrode displacement, and limb position. Most existing sEMG datasets lack these dynamic considerations. This study introduces a novel multichannel sEMG dataset to evaluate commonly used hand gestures across three distinct forearm orientations. The dataset was collected from nineteen able-bodied subjects performing twelve hand gestures in three forearm orientations--supination, rest, and pronation. Eight MFI EMG electrodes were strategically placed at the elbow and mid-forearm to record high-quality EMG signals. Signal quality was validated through Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Motion artifact ratio (SMR) metrics. Hand gesture classification performance across forearm orientations was evaluated using machine learning classifiers, including LDA, SVM, and KNN, alongside five feature extraction methods: TDD, TSD, FTDD, AR-RMS, and SNTDF. Furthermore, deep learning models such as 1D CNN, RNN, LSTM, and hybrid architectures were employed for a comprehensive analysis. Notably, the LDA classifier achieved the highest F1 score of 88.58\% with the SNTDF feature set when trained on hand gesture data of resting and tested across gesture data of all orientations. The promising results from extensive analyses underscore the proposed dataset's potential as a benchmark for advancing gesture recognition technologies, clinical sEMG research, and human-computer interaction applications. The dataset is publicly available in MATLAB format. Dataset: \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ummerummanchaity/fors-emg-a-novel-semg-dataset}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhavika Devnani, Skyler Seto, Zakaria Aldeneh, Alessandro Toso, Elena Menyaylenko, Barry-John Theobald, Jonathan Sheaffer, Miguel Sarabia</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can picture a sound scene given an imprecise natural language description. For example, it is easy to imagine an acoustic environment given a phrase like "the lion roar came from right behind me!". For a machine to have the same degree of comprehension, the machine must know what a lion is (semantic attribute), what the concept of "behind" is (spatial attribute) and how these pieces of linguistic information align with the semantic and spatial attributes of the sound (what a roar sounds like when its coming from behind). State-of-the-art audio foundation models which learn to map between audio scenes and natural textual descriptions, are trained on non-spatial audio and text pairs, and hence lack spatial awareness. In contrast, sound event localization and detection models are limited to recognizing sounds from a fixed number of classes, and they localize the source to absolute position (e.g., 0.2m) rather than a position described using natural language (e.g., "next to me"). To address these gaps, we present ELSA a spatially aware-audio and text embedding model trained using multimodal contrastive learning. ELSA supports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captions describing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA: (a) we spatially augment the audio and captions of three open-source audio datasets totaling 4,738 hours of audio, and (b) we design an encoder to capture the semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes of spatial audio using contrastive learning. ELSA is competitive with state-of-the-art for both semantic retrieval and 3D source localization. In particular, ELSA achieves +2.8% mean audio-to-text and text-to-audio R@1 above the baseline, and outperforms by -11.6{\deg} mean-absolute-error in 3D source localization over the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Bernabeu-Perez, Enrique Lopez-Cuena, Dario Garcia-Gasulla</p>
<p>Abstract: The continued release of increasingly realistic image generation models creates a demand for synthetic image detectors. To build effective detectors we must first understand how factors like data source diversity, training methodologies and image alterations affect their generalization capabilities. This work conducts a systematic analysis and uses its insights to develop practical guidelines for training robust synthetic image detectors. Model generalization capabilities are evaluated across different setups (e.g. scale, sources, transformations) including real-world deployment conditions. Through an extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art detectors across diverse and recent datasets, we show that while current approaches excel in specific scenarios, no single detector achieves universal effectiveness. Critical flaws are identified in detectors, and workarounds are proposed to enable the deployment of real-world detector applications enhancing accuracy, reliability and robustness beyond the limitations of current systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanzhe He, Yutao Zheng, Shijie Xu, Chang Liu, Di Peng, Yingzheng Liu, Weiwei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Background-oriented Schlieren tomography (BOST) is a prevalent method for visualizing intricate turbulent flows, valued for its ease of implementation and capacity to capture three-dimensional distributions of a multitude of flow parameters. However, the voxel-based meshing scheme leads to significant challenges, such as inadequate spatial resolution, substantial discretization errors, poor noise immunity, and excessive computational costs. This work presents an innovative reconstruction approach termed neural refractive index field (NeRIF) which implicitly represents the flow field with a neural network, which is trained with tailored strategies. Both numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations on turbulent Bunsen flames suggest that our approach can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution while concurrently reducing computational expenses. Although showcased in the context of background-oriented schlieren tomography here, the key idea embedded in the NeRIF can be readily adapted to various other tomographic modalities including tomographic absorption spectroscopy and tomographic particle imaging velocimetry, broadening its potential impact across different domains of flow visualization and analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikola Ljube\v{s}i\'c, Peter Rupnik, Danijel Kor\v{z}inek</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent significant improvements in speech and language technologies come both from self-supervised approaches over raw language data as well as various types of explicit supervision. To ensure high-quality processing of spoken data, the most useful type of explicit supervision is still the alignment between the speech signal and its corresponding text transcript, which is a data type that is not available for many languages. In this paper, we present our approach to building large and open speech-and-text-aligned datasets of less-resourced languages based on transcripts of parliamentary proceedings and their recordings. Our starting point are the ParlaMint comparable corpora of transcripts of parliamentary proceedings of 26 national European parliaments. In the pilot run on expanding the ParlaMint corpora with aligned publicly available recordings, we focus on three Slavic languages, namely Croatian, Polish, and Serbian. The main challenge of our approach is the lack of any global alignment between the ParlaMint texts and the available recordings, as well as the sometimes varying data order in each of the modalities, which requires a novel approach in aligning long sequences of text and audio in a large search space. The results of this pilot run are three high-quality datasets that span more than 5,000 hours of speech and accompanying text transcripts. Although these datasets already make a huge difference in the availability of spoken and textual data for the three languages, we want to emphasize the potential of the presented approach in building similar datasets for many more languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongze Wu, Yao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling from high dimensional, multimodal distributions remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and physics based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow, a continuous normalizing flow based approach designed to sample from high dimensional and multimodal distributions. The key idea is to learn a continuous normalizing flow based transport map, guided by annealing, to transition samples from an easy to sample distribution to the target distribution, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high dimensional spaces. Unlike many existing methods, AF training does not rely on samples from the target distribution. AF ensures effective and balanced mode exploration, achieves linear complexity in sample size and dimensions, and circumvents inefficient mixing times. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF compared to state of the art methods through extensive experiments on various challenging distributions and real world datasets, particularly in high-dimensional and multimodal settings. We also highlight the potential of AF for sampling the least favorable distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Gahtan, Robert J. Shahla, Alex M. Bronstein, Reuven Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: QUIC, an increasingly adopted transport protocol, addresses limitations of TCP by offering improved security, performance, and features such as stream multiplexing and connection migration. However, these enhancements also introduce challenges for network operators in monitoring and analyzing web traffic, especially due to QUIC's encryption. Existing datasets are inadequate they are often outdated, lack diversity, anonymize critical information, or exclude essential features like SSL keys-limiting comprehensive research and development in this area. We introduce VisQUIC, a publicly available dataset of over 100,000 labeled QUIC traces with corresponding SSL keys, collected from more than 40,000 websites over four months. By generating visual representations of the traces, we facilitate advanced machine learning (ML) applications and in-depth analysis of encrypted QUIC traffic. To demonstrate the dataset's potential, we estimate the number of HTTP3 request-response pairs in a QUIC connection using only encrypted traffic, achieving up to 92% accuracy. This estimation provides insights into server behavior, client-server interactions, and connection load-crucial for tasks like load balancing and intrusion detection. Our dataset enables comprehensive studies on QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols and supports the development of tools for encrypted traffic analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yule Wang, Chengrui Li, Weihan Li, Anqi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study uses the cosine similarity ratio, embedding regression, and manual re-annotation to diagnose hate speech classification. We begin by computing cosine similarity ratio on a dataset "Measuring Hate Speech" that contains 135,556 annotated comments on social media. This way, we show a basic use of cosine similarity as a description of hate speech content. We then diagnose hate speech classification starting from understanding the inconsistency of human annotation from the dataset. Using embedding regression as a basic diagnostic, we found that female annotators are more sensitive to racial slurs that target the black population. We perform with a more complicated diagnostic by training a hate speech classifier using a SoTA pre-trained large language model, NV-Embed-v2, to convert texts to embeddings and run a logistic regression. This classifier achieves a testing accuracy of 94%. In diagnosing where machines disagree with human annotators, we found that machines make fewer mistakes than humans despite the fact that human annotations are treated as ground truth in the training set. Machines perform better in correctly labeling long statements of facts, but perform worse in labeling short instances of swear words. We hypothesize that this is due to model alignment - while curating models at their creation prevents the models from producing obvious hate speech, it also reduces the model's ability to detect such content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Picard-Weibel, Roman Moscoviz, Benjamin Guedj</p>
<p>Abstract: PAC-Bayes learning is a comprehensive setting for (i) studying the generalisation ability of learning algorithms and (ii) deriving new learning algorithms by optimising a generalisation bound. However, optimising generalisation bounds might not always be viable for tractable or computational reasons, or both. For example, iteratively querying the empirical risk might prove computationally expensive. In response, we introduce a novel principled strategy for building an iterative learning algorithm via the optimisation of a sequence of surrogate training objectives, inherited from PAC-Bayes generalisation bounds. The key argument is to replace the empirical risk (seen as a function of hypotheses) in the generalisation bound by its projection onto a constructible low dimensional functional space: these projections can be queried much more efficiently than the initial risk. On top of providing that generic recipe for learning via surrogate PAC-Bayes bounds, we (i) contribute theoretical results establishing that iteratively optimising our surrogates implies the optimisation of the original generalisation bounds, (ii) instantiate this strategy to the framework of meta-learning, introducing a meta-objective offering a closed form expression for meta-gradient, (iii) illustrate our approach with numerical experiments inspired by an industrial biochemical problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Pizarro Bejarano, Lukas Brunke, Angela P. Schoellig</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers are flexible and performant but rarely guarantee safety. Safety filters impart hard safety guarantees to RL controllers while maintaining flexibility. However, safety filters can cause undesired behaviours due to the separation between the controller and the safety filter, often degrading performance and robustness. In this paper, we analyze several modifications to incorporating the safety filter in training RL controllers rather than solely applying it during evaluation. The modifications allow the RL controller to learn to account for the safety filter, improving performance. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of training RL with safety filters, featuring simulated and real-world experiments with a Crazyflie 2.0 drone. We examine how various training modifications and hyperparameters impact performance, sample efficiency, safety, and chattering. Our findings serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers focused on safety filters and safe RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Shack, Katarina Petrovic, Olga Saukh</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to the robustness and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in computer vision applications. This study investigates the performance of adversarial patches for the YOLO object detection network in the physical world. Two attacks were tested: a patch designed to be placed anywhere within the scene - global patch, and another patch intended to partially overlap with specific object targeted for removal from detection - local patch. Various factors such as patch size, position, rotation, brightness, and hue were analyzed to understand their impact on the effectiveness of the adversarial patches. The results reveal a notable dependency on these parameters, highlighting the challenges in maintaining attack efficacy in real-world conditions. Learning to align digitally applied transformation parameters with those measured in the real world still results in up to a 64\% discrepancy in patch performance. These findings underscore the importance of understanding environmental influences on adversarial attacks, which can inform the development of more robust defenses for practical machine learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature which leads to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentang Song, Zhiyuan Yan, Yuzhen Lin, Taiping Yao, Changsheng Chen, Shen Chen, Yandan Zhao, Shouhong Ding, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the generalization issue in deepfake detection by harnessing forgery quality in training data. Generally, the forgery quality of different deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while others are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of deepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to short-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby hurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel quality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of a Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning pacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training process. The framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to gradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples, starting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ both static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining their scores to produce a final rating for each training sample. The rating score guides the selection of deepfake samples for training, with higher-rated samples having a higher probability of being chosen. Furthermore, we propose a novel frequency data augmentation method specifically designed for low-quality forgery samples, which helps to reduce obvious forgery traces and improve their overall realism. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied in a plug-and-play manner and significantly enhance the generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Franck Rothen, Samuel Klein, Matthew Leigh, Tobias Golling</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular in the context of particle physics. Supervised learning, which uses labeled Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, remains one of the most widely used methods for discriminating signals beyond the Standard Model. However, this paper suggests that supervised models may depend excessively on artifacts and approximations from Monte Carlo simulations, potentially limiting their ability to generalize well to real data. This study aims to enhance the generalization properties of supervised models by reducing the sharpness of local minima. It reviews the application of four distinct white-box adversarial attacks in the context of classifying Higgs boson decay signals. The attacks are divided into weight space attacks, and feature space attacks. To study and quantify the sharpness of different local minima this paper presents two analysis methods: gradient ascent and reduced Hessian eigenvalue analysis. The results show that white-box adversarial attacks significantly improve generalization performance, albeit with increased computational complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a debiasing method for regression estimators, including high-dimensional and nonparametric regression estimators. For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Qualitative analysis is critical to understanding human datasets in many social science disciplines. Open coding is an inductive qualitative process that identifies and interprets "open codes" from datasets. Yet, meeting methodological expectations (such as "as exhaustive as possible") can be challenging. While many machine learning (ML)/generative AI (GAI) studies have attempted to support open coding, few have systematically measured or evaluated GAI outcomes, increasing potential bias risks. Building on Grounded Theory and Thematic Analysis theories, we present a computational method to measure and identify potential biases from "open codes" systematically. Instead of operationalizing human expert results as the "ground truth," our method is built upon a team-based approach between human and machine coders. We experiment with two HCI datasets to establish this method's reliability by 1) comparing it with human analysis, and 2) analyzing its output stability. We present evidence-based suggestions and example workflows for ML/GAI to support open coding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in spoken dialogue models, exemplified by systems like GPT-4o, have captured significant attention in the speech domain. Compared to traditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS), modern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These advanced spoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other speech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics in speech. Moreover, they generate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses with low latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening and speaking capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these systems and the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first compiled existing spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and categorized them into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an in-depth overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering aspects such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex, and interaction capabilities. Each section discusses the limitations of these technologies and outlines considerations for future research. Additionally, we present a thorough review of relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks from the perspectives of training and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. We hope this survey will contribute to advancing both academic research and industrial applications in the field of spoken dialogue systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Apurva Kalia, Dilip Krishnan, Soha Hassoun</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivation: A major challenge in metabolomics is annotation: assigning molecular structures to mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Despite recent advances in molecule-to-spectra and in spectra-to-molecular fingerprint prediction (FP), annotation rates remain low. Results: We introduce in this paper a novel paradigm (JESTR) for annotation. Unlike prior approaches that explicitly construct molecular fingerprints or spectra, JESTR leverages the insight that molecules and their corresponding spectra are views of the same data and effectively embeds their representations in a joint space. Candidate structures are ranked based on cosine similarity between the embeddings of query spectrum and each candidate. We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec and spec-to-FP annotation tools on three datasets. On average, for rank@[1-5], JESTR outperforms other tools by 23.6%-71.6%. We further demonstrate the strong value of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting rank@1 performance by 11.4% and enhancing the model's ability to discern between target and candidate molecules. Through JESTR, we offer a novel promising avenue towards accurate annotation, therefore unlocking valuable insights into the metabolome.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiwon Jang, Sihyun Yu, Jinwoo Shin, Pieter Abbeel, Younggyo Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision models that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However, training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos, inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs patches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\times$128 resolution into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate 128 frames at once.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a common sensing problem in radar, sonar, audio, and wireless communication systems. It has gained renewed importance with the advent of the integrated sensing and communication paradigm. To fully exploit the potential of such sensing systems, it is crucial to take into account potential hardware impairments that can negatively impact the obtained performance. This study introduces a joint DoA estimation and hardware impairment learning scheme following a model-based approach. Specifically, a differentiable version of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is derived, allowing efficient learning of the considered impairments. The proposed approach supports both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, showcasing its practical potential. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method successfully learns significant inaccuracies in both antenna locations and complex gains. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the classical MUSIC algorithm in the DoA estimation task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging the large generative prior of the flow transformer for tuning-free image editing requires authentic inversion to project the image into the model's domain and a flexible invariance control mechanism to preserve non-target contents. However, the prevailing diffusion inversion performs deficiently in flow-based models, and the invariance control cannot reconcile diverse rigid and non-rigid editing tasks. To address these, we systematically analyze the \textbf{inversion and invariance} control based on the flow transformer. Specifically, we unveil that the Euler inversion shares a similar structure to DDIM yet is more susceptible to the approximation error. Thus, we propose a two-stage inversion to first refine the velocity estimation and then compensate for the leftover error, which pivots closely to the model prior and benefits editing. Meanwhile, we propose the invariance control that manipulates the text features within the adaptive layer normalization, connecting the changes in the text prompt to image semantics. This mechanism can simultaneously preserve the non-target contents while allowing rigid and non-rigid manipulation, enabling a wide range of editing types such as visual text, quantity, facial expression, etc. Experiments on versatile scenarios validate that our framework achieves flexible and accurate editing, unlocking the potential of the flow transformer for versatile image editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaan Han, Junxiao Chen, Yanzhe Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror (GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, we introduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-based dependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make a robust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluate CatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different link functions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a high statistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance in different low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating its robustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance in real world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio to forecast the prices of S\&P 500 index components. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTM models without feature selection and FDR control. Additionally, CatNet effectively captures common market-driving features, which helps informed decision-making in financial markets by enhancing the interpretability of predictions. Our study integrates of the Gaussian Mirror algorithm with LSTM models for the first time, and introduces SHAP values as a new feature importance metric for FDR control methods, marking a significant advancement in feature selection and error control for neural networks.</p>
