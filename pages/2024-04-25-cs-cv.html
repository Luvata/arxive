<p><b>Authors:</b> Khai Nguyen, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markos Diomataris, Nikos Athanasiou, Omid Taheri, Xi Wang, Otmar Hilliges, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing natural human motions that enable a 3D human avatar to walk and reach for arbitrary goals in 3D space remains an unsolved problem with many applications. Existing methods (data-driven or using reinforcement learning) are limited in terms of generalization and motion naturalness. A primary obstacle is the scarcity of training data that combines locomotion with goal reaching. To address this, we introduce WANDR, a data-driven model that takes an avatar's initial pose and a goal's 3D position and generates natural human motions that place the end effector (wrist) on the goal location. To solve this, we introduce novel intention features that drive rich goal-oriented movement. Intention guides the agent to the goal, and interactively adapts the generation to novel situations without needing to define sub-goals or the entire motion path. Crucially, intention allows training on datasets that have goal-oriented motions as well as those that do not. WANDR is a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (c-VAE), which we train using the AMASS and CIRCLE datasets. We evaluate our method extensively and demonstrate its ability to generate natural and long-term motions that reach 3D goals and generalize to unseen goal locations. Our models and code are available for research purposes at wandr.is.tue.mpg.de.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15385">Sum of Group Error Differences: A Critical Examination of Bias Evaluation in Biometric Verification and a Dual-Metric Measure</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alaa Elobaid, Nathan Ramoly, Lara Younes, Symeon Papadopoulos, Eirini Ntoutsi, Ioannis Kompatsiaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Biometric Verification (BV) systems often exhibit accuracy disparities across different demographic groups, leading to biases in BV applications. Assessing and quantifying these biases is essential for ensuring the fairness of BV systems. However, existing bias evaluation metrics in BV have limitations, such as focusing exclusively on match or non-match error rates, overlooking bias on demographic groups with performance levels falling between the best and worst performance levels, and neglecting the magnitude of the bias present.
  This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current bias evaluation metrics in BV and, through experimental analysis, demonstrates their contextual suitability, merits, and limitations. Additionally, it introduces a novel general-purpose bias evaluation measure for BV, the ``Sum of Group Error Differences (SEDG)''. Our experimental results on controlled synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of demographic bias quantification when using existing metrics and our own proposed measure. We discuss the applicability of the bias evaluation metrics in a set of simulated demographic bias scenarios and provide scenario-based metric recommendations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Caffagni, Federico Cocchi, Nicholas Moratelli, Sara Sarto, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are the natural evolution of LLMs, and enlarge their capabilities so as to work beyond the pure textual modality. As research is being carried out to design novel architectures and vision-and-language adapters, in this paper we concentrate on endowing such models with the capability of answering questions that require external knowledge. Our approach, termed Wiki-LLaVA, aims at integrating an external knowledge source of multimodal documents, which is accessed through a hierarchical retrieval pipeline. Relevant passages, using this approach, are retrieved from the external knowledge source and employed as additional context for the LLM, augmenting the effectiveness and precision of generated dialogues. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets tailored for visual question answering with external data and demonstrate the appropriateness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alina Pleli, Simon Baeuerle, Michel Janus, Jonas Barth, Ralf Mikut, Hendrik P. A. Lensch</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised clustering of wafer map defect patterns is challenging because the appearance of certain defect patterns varies significantly. This includes changing shape, location, density, and rotation of the defect area on the wafer. We present a harvesting approach, which can cluster even challenging defect patterns of wafer maps well. Our approach makes use of a well-known, three-step procedure: feature extraction, dimension reduction, and clustering. The novelty in our approach lies in repeating dimensionality reduction and clustering iteratively while filtering out one cluster per iteration according to its silhouette score. This method leads to an improvement of clustering performance in general and is especially useful for difficult defect patterns. The low computational effort allows for a quick assessment of large datasets and can be used to support manual labeling efforts. We benchmark against related approaches from the literature and show improved results on a real-world industrial dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeid Abbassi, Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi, Ahad Harati</p>
<p>Abstract: Capsule networks are a type of neural network that identify image parts and form the instantiation parameters of a whole hierarchically. The goal behind the network is to perform an inverse computer graphics task, and the network parameters are the mapping weights that transform parts into a whole. The trainability of capsule networks in complex data with high intra-class or intra-part variation is challenging. This paper presents a multi-prototype architecture for guiding capsule networks to represent the variations in the image parts. To this end, instead of considering a single capsule for each class and part, the proposed method employs several capsules (co-group capsules), capturing multiple prototypes of an object. In the final layer, co-group capsules compete, and their soft output is considered the target for a competitive cross-entropy loss. Moreover, in the middle layers, the most active capsules map to the next layer with a shared weight among the co-groups. Consequently, due to the reduction in parameters, implicit weight-sharing makes it possible to have more deep capsule network layers. The experimental results on MNIST, SVHN, C-Cube, CEDAR, MCYT, and UTSig datasets reveal that the proposed model outperforms others regarding image classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moyuru Yamada</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their capability to synthesize high-quality and diverse images from textual prompts. However, simultaneous control over both global contexts (e.g., object layouts and interactions) and local details (e.g., colors and emotions) still remains a significant challenge. The models often fail to understand complex descriptions involving multiple objects and reflect specified visual attributes to wrong targets or ignore them. This paper presents Global-Local Diffusion (\textit{GLoD}), a novel framework which allows simultaneous control over the global contexts and the local details in text-to-image generation without requiring training or fine-tuning. It assigns multiple global and local prompts to corresponding layers and composes their noises to guide a denoising process using pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework enables complex global-local compositions, conditioning objects in the global prompt with the local prompts while preserving other unspecified identities. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that GLoD effectively generates complex images that adhere to both user-provided object interactions and object details.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15449">ID-Aligner: Enhancing Identity-Preserving Text-to-Image Generation with Reward Feedback Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weifeng Chen, Jiacheng Zhang, Jie Wu, Hefeng Wu, Xuefeng Xiao, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of diffusion models has triggered diverse applications. Identity-preserving text-to-image generation (ID-T2I) particularly has received significant attention due to its wide range of application scenarios like AI portrait and advertising. While existing ID-T2I methods have demonstrated impressive results, several key challenges remain: (1) It is hard to maintain the identity characteristics of reference portraits accurately, (2) The generated images lack aesthetic appeal especially while enforcing identity retention, and (3) There is a limitation that cannot be compatible with LoRA-based and Adapter-based methods simultaneously. To address these issues, we present \textbf{ID-Aligner}, a general feedback learning framework to enhance ID-T2I performance. To resolve identity features lost, we introduce identity consistency reward fine-tuning to utilize the feedback from face detection and recognition models to improve generated identity preservation. Furthermore, we propose identity aesthetic reward fine-tuning leveraging rewards from human-annotated preference data and automatically constructed feedback on character structure generation to provide aesthetic tuning signals. Thanks to its universal feedback fine-tuning framework, our method can be readily applied to both LoRA and Adapter models, achieving consistent performance gains. Extensive experiments on SD1.5 and SDXL diffusion models validate the effectiveness of our approach. \textbf{Project Page: \url{https://idaligner.github.io/}}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Cai, Mohammad Mahdinur Rahman, Jingyu Wu, Yulun Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature pyramids have been widely adopted in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers for tasks like medical image segmentation and object detection. However, the currently existing models generally focus on the Encoder-side Transformer to extract features, from which decoder improvement can bring further potential with well-designed architecture. We propose CFPFormer, a novel decoder block that integrates feature pyramids and transformers. Specifically, by leveraging patch embedding, cross-layer feature concatenation, and Gaussian attention mechanisms, CFPFormer enhances feature extraction capabilities while promoting generalization across diverse tasks. Benefiting from Transformer structure and U-shaped Connections, our introduced model gains the ability to capture long-range dependencies and effectively up-sample feature maps. Our model achieves superior performance in detecting small objects compared to existing methods. We evaluate CFPFormer on medical image segmentation datasets and object detection benchmarks (VOC 2007, VOC2012, MS-COCO), demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility. On the ACDC Post-2017-MICCAI-Challenge online test set, our model reaches exceptionally impressive accuracy, and performed well compared with the original decoder setting in Synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15506">Metric3D v2: A Versatile Monocular Geometric Foundation Model for Zero-shot Metric Depth and Surface Normal Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mu Hu, Wei Yin, Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Cai, Xiaoxiao Long, Hao Chen, Kaixuan Wang, Gang Yu, Chunhua Shen, Shaojie Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Metric3D v2, a geometric foundation model for zero-shot metric depth and surface normal estimation from a single image, which is crucial for metric 3D recovery. While depth and normal are geometrically related and highly complimentary, they present distinct challenges. SoTA monocular depth methods achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. Meanwhile, SoTA normal estimation methods have limited zero-shot performance due to the lack of large-scale labeled data. To tackle these issues, we propose solutions for both metric depth estimation and surface normal estimation. For metric depth estimation, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view model lies in resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models and large-scale data training. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problem and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. For surface normal estimation, we propose a joint depth-normal optimization module to distill diverse data knowledge from metric depth, enabling normal estimators to learn beyond normal labels. Equipped with these modules, our depth-normal models can be stably trained with over 16 million of images from thousands of camera models with different-type annotations, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Kyun Jang, Donghyun Kim, Zihang Meng, Dat Huynh, Ser-Nam Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a task that retrieves images similar to a query, based on a provided textual modification. Current techniques rely on supervised learning for CIR models using labeled triplets of the reference image, text, target image. These specific triplets are not as commonly available as simple image-text pairs, limiting the widespread use of CIR and its scalability. On the other hand, zero-shot CIR can be relatively easily trained with image-caption pairs without considering the image-to-image relation, but this approach tends to yield lower accuracy. We propose a new semi-supervised CIR approach where we search for a reference and its related target images in auxiliary data and learn our large language model-based Visual Delta Generator (VDG) to generate text describing the visual difference (i.e., visual delta) between the two. VDG, equipped with fluent language knowledge and being model agnostic, can generate pseudo triplets to boost the performance of CIR models. Our approach significantly improves the existing supervised learning approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CIR benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Yue, Fangzhou Lin, Guanyi Mou, Ziming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend of incorporating hyperbolic geometry methods into computer vision. While these methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various metric learning tasks using hyperbolic distance measurements, the underlying theoretical analysis supporting this superior performance remains under-exploited. In this study, we investigate the effects of integrating hyperbolic space into metric learning, particularly when training with contrastive loss. We identify a need for a comprehensive comparison between Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces regarding the temperature effect in the contrastive loss within the existing literature. To address this gap, we conduct an extensive investigation to benchmark the results of Vision Transformers (ViTs) using a hybrid objective function that combines loss from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the observed performance improvement. We also reveal that hyperbolic metric learning is highly related to hard negative sampling, providing insights for future work. This work will provide valuable data points and experience in understanding hyperbolic image embeddings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Yunan Wu, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has significantly enhanced the feasibility and reliability of gravitational wave detection. However, LIGO's high sensitivity makes it susceptible to transient noises known as glitches, which necessitate effective differentiation from real gravitational wave signals. Traditional approaches predominantly employ fully supervised or semi-supervised algorithms for the task of glitch classification and clustering. In the future task of identifying and classifying glitches across main and auxiliary channels, it is impractical to build a dataset with manually labeled ground-truth. In addition, the patterns of glitches can vary with time, generating new glitches without manual labels. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Cross-Temporal Spectrogram Autoencoder (CTSAE), a pioneering unsupervised method for the dimensionality reduction and clustering of gravitational wave glitches. CTSAE integrates a novel four-branch autoencoder with a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). To further extract features across multi-branches, we introduce a novel multi-branch fusion method using the CLS (Class) token. Our model, trained and evaluated on the GravitySpy O3 dataset on the main channel, demonstrates superior performance in clustering tasks when compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, CTSAE represents the first unsupervised approach tailored specifically for clustering LIGO data, marking a significant step forward in the field of gravitational wave research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Zhuang, Linshan Wu, Qiong Wang, Varut Vardhanabhuti, Lin Luo, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for 3D medical image analysis. Mask AutoEncoder (MAE) for feature pre-training can further unleash the potential of ViT on various medical vision tasks. However, due to large spatial sizes with much higher dimensions of 3D medical images, the lack of hierarchical design for MAE may hinder the performance of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{Mask in Mask (MiM)} pre-training framework for 3D medical images, which aims to advance MAE by learning discriminative representation from hierarchical visual tokens across varying scales. We introduce multiple levels of granularity for masked inputs from the volume, which are then reconstructed simultaneously ranging at both fine and coarse levels. Additionally, a cross-level alignment mechanism is applied to adjacent level volumes to enforce anatomical similarity hierarchically. Furthermore, we adopt a hybrid backbone to enhance the hierarchical representation learning efficiently during the pre-training. MiM was pre-trained on a large scale of available 3D volumetric images, \textit{i.e.,} Computed Tomography (CT) images containing various body parts. Extensive experiments on thirteen public datasets demonstrate the superiority of MiM over other SSL methods in organ/lesion/tumor segmentation and disease classification. We further scale up the MiM to large pre-training datasets with more than 10k volumes, showing that large-scale pre-training can further enhance the performance of downstream tasks. The improvement also concluded that the research community should pay more attention to the scale of the pre-training dataset towards the healthcare foundation model for 3D medical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Presta, Gabriele Spadaro, Enzo Tartaglione, Attilio Fiandrotti, Marco Grangetto</p>
<p>Abstract: In Learned Image Compression (LIC), a model is trained at encoding and decoding images sampled from a source domain, often outperforming traditional codecs on natural images; yet its performance may be far from optimal on images sampled from different domains. In this work, we tackle the problem of adapting a pre-trained model to multiple target domains by plugging into the decoder an adapter module for each of them, including the source one. Each adapter improves the decoder performance on a specific domain, without the model forgetting about the images seen at training time. A gate network computes the weights to optimally blend the contributions from the adapters when the bitstream is decoded. We experimentally validate our method over two state-of-the-art pre-trained models, observing improved rate-distortion efficiency on the target domains without penalties on the source domain. Furthermore, the gate's ability to find similarities with the learned target domains enables better encoding efficiency also for images outside them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Peng Zou, Vinay Samuel, Yue Zhou, Weizhi Zhang, Liancheng Fang, Zihe Song, Philip S. Yu, Cornelia Caragea</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing datasets for attribute value extraction (AVE) predominantly focus on explicit attribute values while neglecting the implicit ones, lack product images, are often not publicly available, and lack an in-depth human inspection across diverse domains. To address these limitations, we present ImplicitAVE, the first, publicly available multimodal dataset for implicit attribute value extraction. ImplicitAVE, sourced from the MAVE dataset, is carefully curated and expanded to include implicit AVE and multimodality, resulting in a refined dataset of 68k training and 1.6k testing data across five domains. We also explore the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to implicit AVE, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for MLLMs on the ImplicitAVE dataset. Six recent MLLMs with eleven variants are evaluated across diverse settings, revealing that implicit value extraction remains a challenging task for MLLMs. The contributions of this work include the development and release of ImplicitAVE, and the exploration and benchmarking of various MLLMs for implicit AVE, providing valuable insights and potential future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Hernandez-Diaz, Josef Bigun, Fernando Alonso-Fernandez</p>
<p>Abstract: Our study provides evidence that CNNs struggle to effectively extract orientation features. We show that the use of Complex Structure Tensor, which contains compact orientation features with certainties, as input to CNNs consistently improves identification accuracy compared to using grayscale inputs alone. Experiments also demonstrated that our inputs, which were provided by mini complex conv-nets, combined with reduced CNN sizes, outperformed full-fledged, prevailing CNN architectures. This suggests that the upfront use of orientation features in CNNs, a strategy seen in mammalian vision, not only mitigates their limitations but also enhances their explainability and relevance to thin-clients. Experiments were done on publicly available data sets comprising periocular images for biometric identification and verification (Close and Open World) using 6 State of the Art CNN architectures. We reduced SOA Equal Error Rate (EER) on the PolyU dataset by 5-26% depending on data and scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfeng Lin, Zhixiong Jin, Seongjin Choi, Hwasoo Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing pedestrian safety at intersections is one of the paramount concerns in the field of transportation research, driven by the urgency of reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities. With advances in computer vision technologies and predictive models, the pursuit of developing real-time proactive protection systems is increasingly recognized as vital to improving pedestrian safety at intersections. The core of these protection systems lies in the prediction-based evaluation of pedestrian's potential risks, which plays a significant role in preventing the occurrence of accidents. The major challenges in the current prediction-based potential risk evaluation research can be summarized into three aspects: the inadequate progress in creating a real-time framework for the evaluation of pedestrian's potential risks, the absence of accurate and explainable safety indicators that can represent the potential risk, and the lack of tailor-made evaluation criteria specifically for each category of pedestrians. To address these research challenges, in this study, a framework with computer vision technologies and predictive models is developed to evaluate the potential risk of pedestrians in real time. Integral to this framework is a novel surrogate safety measure, the Predicted Post-Encroachment Time (P-PET), derived from deep learning models capable to predict the arrival time of pedestrians and vehicles at intersections. To further improve the effectiveness and reliability of pedestrian risk evaluation, we classify pedestrians into distinct categories and apply specific evaluation criteria for each group. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to effectively identify potential risks through the use of P-PET, indicating its feasibility for real-time applications and its improved performance in risk evaluation across different categories of pedestrians.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Chen, Zhang Wen, Chao Wang, Lei Gong, Zhongchao Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Hazy images degrade visual quality, and dehazing is a crucial prerequisite for subsequent processing tasks. Most current dehazing methods rely on neural networks and face challenges such as high computational parameter pressure and weak generalization capabilities. This paper introduces PriorNet--a novel, lightweight, and highly applicable dehazing network designed to significantly improve the clarity and visual quality of hazy images while avoiding excessive detail extraction issues. The core of PriorNet is the original Multi-Dimensional Interactive Attention (MIA) mechanism, which effectively captures a wide range of haze characteristics, substantially reducing the computational load and generalization difficulties associated with complex systems. By utilizing a uniform convolutional kernel size and incorporating skip connections, we have streamlined the feature extraction process. Simplifying the number of layers and architecture not only enhances dehazing efficiency but also facilitates easier deployment on edge devices. Extensive testing across multiple datasets has demonstrated PriorNet's exceptional performance in dehazing and clarity restoration, maintaining image detail and color fidelity in single-image dehazing tasks. Notably, with a model size of just 18Kb, PriorNet showcases superior dehazing generalization capabilities compared to other methods. Our research makes a significant contribution to advancing image dehazing technology, providing new perspectives and tools for the field and related domains, particularly emphasizing the importance of improving universality and deployability.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D sensing technologies, obtaining 3D shape information of objects has become increasingly convenient. Lidar technology, with its capability to accurately capture the 3D information of objects at long distances, has been widely applied in the collection of 3D data in urban scenes. However, the collected point cloud data often exhibit incompleteness due to factors such as occlusion, signal absorption, and specular reflection. This paper explores the application of point cloud completion technologies in processing these incomplete data and establishes a new real-world benchmark Building-PCC dataset, to evaluate the performance of existing deep learning methods in the task of urban building point cloud completion. Through a comprehensive evaluation of different methods, we analyze the key challenges faced in building point cloud completion, aiming to promote innovation in the field of 3D geoinformation applications.

<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a transformative method for learning effective visual representations through the alignment of image and text embeddings. However, pairwise similarity computation in contrastive loss between image and text pairs poses computational challenges. This paper presents a novel weakly supervised pre-training of vision models on web-scale image-text data. The proposed method reframes pre-training on image-text data as a classification task. Consequently, it eliminates the need for pairwise similarity computations in contrastive loss, achieving a remarkable $2.7\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to contrastive learning on web-scale data. Through extensive experiments spanning diverse vision tasks, including detection and segmentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method maintains high representation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Yao, Qi Qian, Juhua Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple clustering has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to reveal multiple hidden structures of data from different perspectives. The advent of deep multiple clustering techniques has notably advanced the performance by uncovering complex patterns and relationships within large datasets. However, a major challenge arises as users often do not need all the clusterings that algorithms generate, and figuring out the one needed requires a substantial understanding of each clustering result. Traditionally, aligning a user's brief keyword of interest with the corresponding vision components was challenging, but the emergence of multi-modal and large language models (LLMs) has begun to bridge this gap. In response, given unlabeled target visual data, we propose Multi-MaP, a novel method employing a multi-modal proxy learning process. It leverages CLIP encoders to extract coherent text and image embeddings, with GPT-4 integrating users' interests to formulate effective textual contexts. Moreover, reference word constraint and concept-level constraint are designed to learn the optimal text proxy according to the user's interest. Multi-MaP not only adeptly captures a user's interest via a keyword but also facilitates identifying relevant clusterings. Our extensive experiments show that Multi-MaP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all benchmark multi-clustering vision tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Reza Hosseinzadeh Taher, Michael B. Gotway, Jianming Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans effortlessly interpret images by parsing them into part-whole hierarchies; deep learning excels in learning multi-level feature spaces, but they often lack explicit coding of part-whole relations, a prominent property of medical imaging. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Adam-v2, a new self-supervised learning framework extending Adam [79] by explicitly incorporating part-whole hierarchies into its learning objectives through three key branches: (1) Localizability, acquiring discriminative representations to distinguish different anatomical patterns; (2) Composability, learning each anatomical structure in a parts-to-whole manner; and (3) Decomposability, comprehending each anatomical structure in a whole-to-parts manner. Experimental results across 10 tasks, compared to 11 baselines in zero-shot, few-shot transfer, and full fine-tuning settings, showcase Adam-v2's superior performance over large-scale medical models and existing SSL methods across diverse downstream tasks. The higher generality and robustness of Adam-v2's representations originate from its explicit construction of hierarchies for distinct anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images. Adam-v2 preserves a semantic balance of anatomical diversity and harmony in its embedding, yielding representations that are both generic and semantically meaningful, yet overlooked in existing SSL methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinghe Wang, Baolu Li, Xiaomin Li, Bing Cao, Liqian Ma, Huchuan Lu, Xu Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have opened new frontiers in human-centric generation. However, these models cannot be directly employed to generate images with consistent newly coined identities. In this work, we propose CharacterFactory, a framework that allows sampling new characters with consistent identities in the latent space of GANs for diffusion models. More specifically, we consider the word embeddings of celeb names as ground truths for the identity-consistent generation task and train a GAN model to learn the mapping from a latent space to the celeb embedding space. In addition, we design a context-consistent loss to ensure that the generated identity embeddings can produce identity-consistent images in various contexts. Remarkably, the whole model only takes 10 minutes for training, and can sample infinite characters end-to-end during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed CharacterFactory on character creation in terms of identity consistency and editability. Furthermore, the generated characters can be seamlessly combined with the off-the-shelf image/video/3D diffusion models. We believe that the proposed CharacterFactory is an important step for identity-consistent character generation. Project page is available at: https://qinghew.github.io/CharacterFactory/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Che, Fazle Rafsani, Jay Shah, Md Mahfuzur Rahman Siddiquee, Teresa Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-supervised diffusion models (DM) in anomaly segmentation, leveraging image-level labels, have attracted significant attention for their superior performance compared to unsupervised methods. It eliminates the need for pixel-level labels in training, offering a more cost-effective alternative to supervised methods. However, existing methods are not fully weakly-supervised because they heavily rely on costly pixel-level labels for hyperparameter tuning in inference. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Anomaly Segmentation with Forward Process of Diffusion Models (AnoFPDM), a fully weakly-supervised framework that operates without the need for pixel-level labels. Leveraging the unguided forward process as a reference, we identify suitable hyperparameters, i.e., noise scale and threshold, for each input image. We aggregate anomaly maps from each step in the forward process, enhancing the signal strength of anomalous regions. Remarkably, our proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art weakly-supervised approaches, even without utilizing pixel-level labels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic images generated by deep learning algorithms, represent one of the biggest challenges in the field of Digital Forensics. The scientific community is working to develop approaches that can discriminate the origin of digital images (real or AI-generated). However, these methodologies face the challenge of generalization, that is, the ability to discern the nature of an image even if it is generated by an architecture not seen during training. This usually leads to a drop in performance. In this context, we propose a novel approach based on three blocks called Base Models, each of which is responsible for extracting the discriminative features of a specific image class (Diffusion Model-generated, GAN-generated, or real) as it is trained by exploiting deliberately unbalanced datasets. The features extracted from each block are then concatenated and processed to discriminate the origin of the input image. Experimental results showed that this approach not only demonstrates good robust capabilities to JPEG compression but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several generalization tests.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yan, Zifu Wan, Xinhao Deng, Pingping Zhang, Yang Liu, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows exceptional performance in generating high-quality object masks and achieving zero-shot image segmentation. However, as a versatile vision model, SAM is primarily trained with large-scale natural light images. In underwater scenes, it exhibits substantial performance degradation due to the light scattering and absorption. Meanwhile, the simplicity of the SAM's decoder might lead to the loss of fine-grained object details. To address the above issues, we propose a novel feature learning framework named MAS-SAM for marine animal segmentation, which involves integrating effective adapters into the SAM's encoder and constructing a pyramidal decoder. More specifically, we first build a new SAM's encoder with effective adapters for underwater scenes. Then, we introduce a Hypermap Extraction Module (HEM) to generate multi-scale features for a comprehensive guidance. Finally, we propose a Progressive Prediction Decoder (PPD) to aggregate the multi-scale features and predict the final segmentation results. When grafting with the Fusion Attention Module (FAM), our method enables to extract richer marine information from global contextual cues to fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on four public MAS datasets demonstrate that our MAS-SAM can obtain better results than other typical segmentation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinseo Jeong, Junseo Koo, Qimeng Zhang, Gunhee Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods suppose that scenes are exclusively illuminated by distant light sources, neglecting the potential influence of emissive sources within a scene. In this work, we confront this limitation using LDR multi-view images captured with emissive sources turned on and off. Two key issues must be addressed: 1) ambiguity arising from the limited dynamic range along with unknown lighting details, and 2) the expensive computational cost in volume rendering to backtrace the paths leading to final object colors. We present a novel approach, ESR-NeRF, leveraging neural networks as learnable functions to represent ray-traced fields. By training networks to satisfy light transport segments, we regulate outgoing radiances, progressively identifying emissive sources while being aware of reflection areas. The results on scenes encompassing emissive sources with various properties demonstrate the superiority of ESR-NeRF in qualitative and quantitative ways. Our approach also extends its applicability to the scenes devoid of emissive sources, achieving lower CD metrics on the DTU dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we aim to learn a unified vision-based policy for a multi-fingered robot hand to manipulate different objects in diverse poses. Though prior work has demonstrated that human videos can benefit policy learning, performance improvement has been limited by physically implausible trajectories extracted from videos. Moreover, reliance on privileged object information such as ground-truth object states further limits the applicability in realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework ViViDex to improve vision-based policy learning from human videos. It first uses reinforcement learning with trajectory guided rewards to train state-based policies for each video, obtaining both visually natural and physically plausible trajectories from the video. We then rollout successful episodes from state-based policies and train a unified visual policy without using any privileged information. A coordinate transformation method is proposed to significantly boost the performance. We evaluate our method on three dexterous manipulation tasks and demonstrate a large improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has gained considerable traction thanks to its utilization of succinct and robust skeletal representations. Nonetheless, current methodologies often lean towards utilizing a solitary backbone to model skeleton modality, which can be limited by inherent flaws in the network backbone. To address this and fully leverage the complementary characteristics of various network architectures, we propose a novel Hybrid Dual-Branch Network (HDBN) for robust skeleton-based action recognition, which benefits from the graph convolutional network's proficiency in handling graph-structured data and the powerful modeling capabilities of Transformers for global information. In detail, our proposed HDBN is divided into two trunk branches: MixGCN and MixFormer. The two branches utilize GCNs and Transformers to model both 2D and 3D skeletal modalities respectively. Our proposed HDBN emerged as one of the top solutions in the Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition (MMVRAC) of 2024 ICME Grand Challenge, achieving accuracies of 47.95% and 75.36% on two benchmarks of the UAV-Human dataset by outperforming most existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankit Vani, Bac Nguyen, Samuel Lavoie, Ranjay Krishna, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective attention helps us focus on task-relevant aspects in the constant flood of our sensory input. This constraint in our perception allows us to robustly generalize under distractions and to new compositions of perceivable concepts. Transformers employ a similar notion of attention in their architecture, but representation learning models with transformer backbones like CLIP and DINO often fail to demonstrate robustness and compositionality. We highlight a missing architectural prior: unlike human perception, transformer encodings do not separately attend over individual concepts. In response, we propose SPARO, a read-out mechanism that partitions encodings into separately-attended slots, each produced by a single attention head. Using SPARO with CLIP imparts an inductive bias that the vision and text modalities are different views of a shared compositional world with the same corresponding concepts. Using SPARO, we demonstrate improvements on downstream recognition, robustness, retrieval, and compositionality benchmarks with CLIP (up to +14% for ImageNet, +4% for SugarCrepe), and on nearest neighbors and linear probe for ImageNet with DINO (+3% each). We also showcase a powerful ability to intervene and select individual SPARO concepts to further improve downstream task performance (up from +4% to +9% for SugarCrepe) and use this ability to study the robustness of SPARO's representation structure. Finally, we provide insights through ablation experiments and visualization of learned concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Binglin Chen, Yongsen Zheng, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of metro traffic is crucial for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer. The code will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Folco Bertini Baldassini, Mustafa Shukor, Matthieu Cord, Laure Soulier, Benjamin Piwowarski</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, exhibiting the capacity to swiftly acquire new skills, such as through In-Context Learning (ICL) with minimal demonstration examples. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for investigating Multimodal ICL (M-ICL) in the context of Large Multimodal Models. We consider the best open-source multimodal models (e.g., IDEFICS, OpenFlamingo) and a wide range of multimodal tasks. Our study unveils several noteworthy findings: (1) M-ICL primarily relies on text-driven mechanisms, showing little to no influence from the image modality. (2) When used with advanced-ICL strategy (like RICES), M-ICL is not better than a simple strategy based on majority voting over context examples. Moreover, we identify several biases and limitations of M-ICL that warrant consideration prior to deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Gao, Yuqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper handles the problem of converting real pictures into traditional Chinese ink-wash paintings, i.e., Chinese ink-wash painting style transfer. Though this problem could be realized by a wide range of image-to-image translation models, a notable issue with all these methods is that the original image content details could be easily erased or corrupted due to transfer of ink-wash style elements. To solve or ameliorate this issue, we propose to incorporate saliency detection into the unpaired image-to-image translation framework to regularize content information of the generated paintings. The saliency map is utilized for content regularization from two aspects, both explicitly and implicitly: (\romannumeral1) we propose saliency IOU (SIOU) loss to explicitly regularize saliency consistency before and after stylization; (\romannumeral2) we propose saliency adaptive normalization (SANorm) which implicitly enhances content integrity of the generated paintings by injecting saliency information to the generator network to guide painting generation. Besides, we also propose saliency attended discriminator network which harnesses saliency mask to focus generative adversarial attention onto salient image regions, it contributes to producing finer ink-wash stylization effect for salient objects of images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments consistently demonstrate superiority of our model over related advanced methods for Chinese ink-wash painting style transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jag Mohan Singh, Raghavendra Ramachandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are widely used in commercial environments, such as e-commerce and e-banking, owing to their high accuracy in real-world conditions. However, these systems are vulnerable to facial morphing attacks, which are generated by blending face color images of different subjects. This paper presents a new method for generating 3D face morphs from two bona fide point clouds. The proposed method first selects bona fide point clouds with neutral expressions. The two input point clouds were then registered using a Bayesian Coherent Point Drift (BCPD) without optimization, and the geometry and color of the registered point clouds were averaged to generate a face morphing point cloud. The proposed method generates 388 face-morphing point clouds from 200 bona fide subjects. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated through extensive vulnerability experiments, achieving a Generalized Morphing Attack Potential (G-MAP) of 97.93%, which is superior to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) with a G-MAP of 81.61%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip M\"uller, Georgios Kaissis, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: Report generation models offer fine-grained textual interpretations of medical images like chest X-rays, yet they often lack interactivity (i.e. the ability to steer the generation process through user queries) and localized interpretability (i.e. visually grounding their predictions), which we deem essential for future adoption in clinical practice. While there have been efforts to tackle these issues, they are either limited in their interactivity by not supporting textual queries or fail to also offer localized interpretability. Therefore, we propose a novel multitask architecture and training paradigm integrating textual prompts and bounding boxes for diverse aspects like anatomical regions and pathologies. We call this approach the Chest X-Ray Explainer (ChEX). Evaluations across a heterogeneous set of 9 chest X-ray tasks, including localized image interpretation and report generation, showcase its competitiveness with SOTA models while additional analysis demonstrates ChEX's interactive capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Jiang, Hao Tang, Rui Yan, Jinhui Tang, Zechao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) is to learn visual representations that distinguish visually similar objects while maintaining generalization. Existing methods propose to generate discriminative features, but rarely consider the particularity of the FGIR task itself. This paper presents a meticulous analysis leading to the proposal of practical guidelines to identify subcategory-specific discrepancies and generate discriminative features to design effective FGIR models. These guidelines include emphasizing the object (G1), highlighting subcategory-specific discrepancies (G2), and employing effective training strategy (G3). Following G1 and G2, we design a novel Dual Visual Filtering mechanism for the plain visual transformer, denoted as DVF, to capture subcategory-specific discrepancies. Specifically, the dual visual filtering mechanism comprises an object-oriented module and a semantic-oriented module. These components serve to magnify objects and identify discriminative regions, respectively. Following G3, we implement a discriminative model training strategy to improve the discriminability and generalization ability of DVF. Extensive analysis and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our proposed guidelines. Without bells and whistles, the proposed DVF achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used fine-grained datasets in closed-set and open-set settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Anand, Bharat Lohani, Gaurav Pandey, Rakesh Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) heavily rely on LiDAR perception for environment understanding and navigation. LiDAR intensity provides valuable information about the reflected laser signals and plays a crucial role in enhancing the perception capabilities of AVs. However, accurately simulating LiDAR intensity remains a challenge due to the unavailability of material properties of the objects in the environment, and complex interactions between the laser beam and the environment. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy of intensity simulation by incorporating physics-based modalities within the deep learning framework. One of the key entities that captures the interaction between the laser beam and the objects is the angle of incidence. In this work we demonstrate that the addition of the LiDAR incidence angle as a separate input to the deep neural networks significantly enhances the results. We present a comparative study between two prominent deep learning architectures: U-NET a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Pix2Pix a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We implemented these two architectures for the intensity prediction task and used SemanticKITTI and VoxelScape datasets for experiments. The comparative analysis reveals that both architectures benefit from the incidence angle as an additional input. Moreover, the Pix2Pix architecture outperforms U-NET, especially when the incidence angle is incorporated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Chung Hsu, Chih-Yu Jian, Eng-Shen Tu, Chia-Ming Lee, Guan-Lin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges associated with hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction from miniaturized satellites, which often suffer from stripe effects and are computationally resource-limited. We propose a Real-Time Compressed Sensing (RTCS) network designed to be lightweight and require only relatively few training samples for efficient and robust HSI reconstruction in the presence of the stripe effect and under noisy transmission conditions. The RTCS network features a simplified architecture that reduces the required training samples and allows for easy implementation on integer-8-based encoders, facilitating rapid compressed sensing for stripe-like HSI, which exactly matches the moderate design of miniaturized satellites on push broom scanning mechanism. This contrasts optimization-based models that demand high-precision floating-point operations, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. Our encoder employs an integer-8-compatible linear projection for stripe-like HSI data transmission, ensuring real-time compressed sensing. Furthermore, based on the novel two-streamed architecture, an efficient HSI restoration decoder is proposed for the receiver side, allowing for edge-device reconstruction without needing a sophisticated central server. This is particularly crucial as an increasing number of miniaturized satellites necessitates significant computing resources on the ground station. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our approach, offering new and vital capabilities for existing miniaturized satellite systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15785">Seeing Beyond Classes: Zero-Shot Grounded Situation Recognition via Language Explainer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Lei, Lin Li, Chunping Wang, Jun Xiao, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Benefiting from strong generalization ability, pre-trained vision language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, have been widely utilized in zero-shot scene understanding. Unlike simple recognition tasks, grounded situation recognition (GSR) requires the model not only to classify salient activity (verb) in the image, but also to detect all semantic roles that participate in the action. This complex task usually involves three steps: verb recognition, semantic role grounding, and noun recognition. Directly employing class-based prompts with VLMs and grounding models for this task suffers from several limitations, e.g., it struggles to distinguish ambiguous verb concepts, accurately localize roles with fixed verb-centric template1 input, and achieve context-aware noun predictions. In this paper, we argue that these limitations stem from the mode's poor understanding of verb/noun classes. To this end, we introduce a new approach for zero-shot GSR via Language EXplainer (LEX), which significantly boosts the model's comprehensive capabilities through three explainers: 1) verb explainer, which generates general verb-centric descriptions to enhance the discriminability of different verb classes; 2) grounding explainer, which rephrases verb-centric templates for clearer understanding, thereby enhancing precise semantic role localization; and 3) noun explainer, which creates scene-specific noun descriptions to ensure context-aware noun recognition. By equipping each step of the GSR process with an auxiliary explainer, LEX facilitates complex scene understanding in real-world scenarios. Our extensive validations on the SWiG dataset demonstrate LEX's effectiveness and interoperability in zero-shot GSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Ran Yi, Yating Wang, Hongrui Huang, Jieyu Weng, Yabiao Wang, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of diffusion models has greatly propelled the progress in image and video generation. Recently, some efforts have been made in controllable video generation, including text-to-video generation and video motion control, among which camera motion control is an important topic. However, existing camera motion control methods rely on training a temporal camera module, and necessitate substantial computation resources due to the large amount of parameters in video generation models. Moreover, existing methods pre-define camera motion types during training, which limits their flexibility in camera control. Therefore, to reduce training costs and achieve flexible camera control, we propose COMD, a novel training-free video motion transfer model, which disentangles camera motions and object motions in source videos and transfers the extracted camera motions to new videos. We first propose a one-shot camera motion disentanglement method to extract camera motion from a single source video, which separates the moving objects from the background and estimates the camera motion in the moving objects region based on the motion in the background by solving a Poisson equation. Furthermore, we propose a few-shot camera motion disentanglement method to extract the common camera motion from multiple videos with similar camera motions, which employs a window-based clustering technique to extract the common features in temporal attention maps of multiple videos. Finally, we propose a motion combination method to combine different types of camera motions together, enabling our model a more controllable and flexible camera control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free approach can effectively decouple camera-object motion and apply the decoupled camera motion to a wide range of controllable video generation tasks, achieving flexible and diverse camera motion control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oriol Barbany, Michael Huang, Xinliang Zhu, Arnab Dhua</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal search has become increasingly important in providing users with a natural and effective way to ex-press their search intentions. Images offer fine-grained details of the desired products, while text allows for easily incorporating search modifications. However, some existing multimodal search systems are unreliable and fail to address simple queries. The problem becomes harder with the large variability of natural language text queries, which may contain ambiguous, implicit, and irrelevant in-formation. Addressing these issues may require systems with enhanced matching capabilities, reasoning abilities, and context-aware query parsing and rewriting. This paper introduces a novel multimodal search model that achieves a new performance milestone on the Fashion200K dataset. Additionally, we propose a novel search interface integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate natural language interaction. This interface routes queries to search systems while conversationally engaging with users and considering previous searches. When coupled with our multimodal search model, it heralds a new era of shopping assistants capable of offering human-like interaction and enhancing the overall search experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong Ji, Yimu Su, Yan Zhang, Jiacheng Hou, Yanwei Pang, Jungong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Wire Inpainting (VWI) is a prominent application in video inpainting, aimed at flawlessly removing wires in films or TV series, offering significant time and labor savings compared to manual frame-by-frame removal. However, wire removal poses greater challenges due to the wires being longer and slimmer than objects typically targeted in general video inpainting tasks, and often intersecting with people and background objects irregularly, which adds complexity to the inpainting process. Recognizing the limitations posed by existing video wire datasets, which are characterized by their small size, poor quality, and limited variety of scenes, we introduce a new VWI dataset with a novel mask generation strategy, namely Wire Removal Video Dataset 2 (WRV2) and Pseudo Wire-Shaped (PWS) Masks. WRV2 dataset comprises over 4,000 videos with an average length of 80 frames, designed to facilitate the development and efficacy of inpainting models. Building upon this, our research proposes the Redundancy-Aware Transformer (Raformer) method that addresses the unique challenges of wire removal in video inpainting. Unlike conventional approaches that indiscriminately process all frame patches, Raformer employs a novel strategy to selectively bypass redundant parts, such as static background segments devoid of valuable information for inpainting. At the core of Raformer is the Redundancy-Aware Attention (RAA) module, which isolates and accentuates essential content through a coarse-grained, window-based attention mechanism. This is complemented by a Soft Feature Alignment (SFA) module, which refines these features and achieves end-to-end feature alignment. Extensive experiments on both the traditional video inpainting datasets and our proposed WRV2 dataset demonstrate that Raformer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Montero, Miguel D. Mahecha, C\'esar Aybar, Clemens Mosig, Sebastian Wieneke</p>
<p>Abstract: The Sentinel-2 (S2) mission from the European Space Agency's Copernicus program provides essential data for Earth surface analysis. Its Level-2A products deliver high-to-medium resolution (10-60 m) surface reflectance (SR) data through the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). To enhance the accuracy and comparability of SR data, adjustments simulating a nadir viewing perspective are essential. These corrections address the anisotropic nature of SR and the variability in sun and observation angles, ensuring consistent image comparisons over time and under different conditions. The $c$-factor method, a simple yet effective algorithm, adjusts observed S2 SR by using the MODIS BRDF model to achieve Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Despite the straightforward application of the $c$-factor to individual images, a cohesive Python framework for its application across multiple S2 images and Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) from cloud-stored data has been lacking. Here we introduce sen2nbar, a Python package crafted to convert S2 SR data to NBAR, supporting both individual images and ESDCs derived from cloud-stored data. This package simplifies the conversion of S2 SR data to NBAR via a single function, organized into modules for efficient process management. By facilitating NBAR conversion for both SAFE files and ESDCs from SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), sen2nbar is developed as a flexible tool that can handle diverse data format requirements. We anticipate that sen2nbar will considerably contribute to the standardization and harmonization of S2 data, offering a robust solution for a diverse range of users across various applications. sen2nbar is an open-source tool available at https://github.com/ESDS-Leipzig/sen2nbar.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore a novel task of generating human grasps based on single-view scene point clouds, which more accurately mirrors the typical real-world situation of observing objects from a single viewpoint. Due to the incompleteness of object point clouds and the presence of numerous scene points, the generated hand is prone to penetrating into the invisible parts of the object and the model is easily affected by scene points. Thus, we introduce S2HGrasp, a framework composed of two key modules: the Global Perception module that globally perceives partial object point clouds, and the DiffuGrasp module designed to generate high-quality human grasps based on complex inputs that include scene points. Additionally, we introduce S2HGD dataset, which comprises approximately 99,000 single-object single-view scene point clouds of 1,668 unique objects, each annotated with one human grasp. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that S2HGrasp can not only generate natural human grasps regardless of scene points, but also effectively prevent penetration between the hand and invisible parts of the object. Moreover, our model showcases strong generalization capability when applied to unseen objects. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/S2HGrasp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahan Li, Yuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The most recent UDA methods always resort to adversarial training to yield state-of-the-art results and a dominant number of existing UDA methods employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors to learn domain invariant features. Vision transformer (ViT) has attracted tremendous attention since its emergence and has been widely used in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, yet its potential in adversarial domain adaptation has never been investigated. In this paper, we fill this gap by employing the ViT as the feature extractor in adversarial domain adaptation. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that ViT can be a plug-and-play component in adversarial domain adaptation, which means directly replacing the CNN-based feature extractor in existing UDA methods with the ViT-based feature extractor can easily obtain performance improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael K\"osel, Marcel Schreiber, Michael Ulrich, Claudius Gl\"aser, Klaus Dietmayer</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection has become an essential part of automated driving due to its ability to localize and classify objects precisely in 3D. However, object detectors face a critical challenge when dealing with unknown foreground objects, particularly those that were not present in their original training data. These out-of-distribution (OOD) objects can lead to misclassifications, posing a significant risk to the safety and reliability of automated vehicles. Currently, LiDAR-based OOD object detection has not been well studied. We address this problem by generating synthetic training data for OOD objects by perturbing known object categories. Our idea is that these synthetic OOD objects produce different responses in the feature map of an object detector compared to in-distribution (ID) objects. We then extract features using a pre-trained and fixed object detector and train a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify each detection as either ID or OOD. In addition, we propose a new evaluation protocol that allows the use of existing datasets without modifying the point cloud, ensuring a more authentic evaluation of real-world scenarios. The effectiveness of our method is validated through experiments on the newly proposed nuScenes OOD benchmark. The source code is available at https://github.com/uulm-mrm/mmood3d.</p>

<p>Abstract: Latency attacks against object detection represent a variant of adversarial attacks that aim to inflate the inference time by generating additional ghost objects in a target image. However, generating ghost objects in the black-box scenario remains a challenge since information about these unqualified objects remains opaque. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of generating ghost objects in adversarial examples by extending the concept of "steal now, decrypt later" attacks. These adversarial examples, once produced, can be employed to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the AI service, giving rise to significant security concerns. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack achieves successful attacks across various commonly used models and Google Vision API without any prior knowledge about the target model. Additionally, the average cost of each attack is less than \$ 1 dollars, posing a significant threat to AI security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunsu Baek, Keondo Park, Jiyoon Kim, Hyung-Sin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision applications predict on digital images acquired by a camera from physical scenes through light. However, conventional robustness benchmarks rely on perturbations in digitized images, diverging from distribution shifts occurring in the image acquisition process. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new distribution shift dataset, ImageNet-ES, comprising variations in environmental and camera sensor factors by directly capturing 202k images with a real camera in a controllable testbed. With the new dataset, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and model robustness. We find that existing OOD detection methods do not cope with the covariate shifts in ImageNet-ES, implying that the definition and detection of OOD should be revisited to embrace real-world distribution shifts. We also observe that the model becomes more robust in both ImageNet-C and -ES by learning environment and sensor variations in addition to existing digital augmentations. Lastly, our results suggest that effective shift mitigation via camera sensor control can significantly improve performance without increasing model size. With these findings, our benchmark may aid future research on robustness, OOD, and camera sensor control for computer vision.

Existing solutions are either unconditional or dependent on coarse conditions (e.g., pose, text), thus lacking explicit geometry and appearance control of body and garment. Sketching offers such editing ability and has been adopted in various sketch-based face generation and editing solutions. However, directly adapting sketch-based face generation to full-body generation often fails to produce high-fidelity and diverse results due to the high complexity and diversity in the pose, body shape, and garment shape and texture. Recent geometrically controllable diffusion-based methods mainly rely on prompts to generate appearance and it is hard to balance the realism and the faithfulness of their results to the sketch when the input is coarse. This work presents Sketch2Human, the first system for controllable full-body human image generation guided by a semantic sketch (for geometry control) and a reference image (for appearance control). Our solution is based on the latent space of StyleGAN-Human with inverted geometry and appearance latent codes as input. Specifically, we present a sketch encoder trained with a large synthetic dataset sampled from StyleGAN-Human's latent space and directly supervised by sketches rather than real images. Considering the entangled information of partial geometry and texture in StyleGAN-Human and the absence of disentangled datasets, we design a novel training scheme that creates geometry-preserved and appearance-transferred training data to tune a generator to achieve disentangled geometry and appearance control. Although our method is trained with synthetic data, it can handle hand-drawn sketches as well. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhi Wang, Feng Zhou, Jianqin Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction technologies have paved the way for high-quality and real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes. Despite these achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by GAussian Segmentation. OMEGAS employs a multi-step approach, grounded in several excellent off-the-shelf methodologies. Specifically, initially, we utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to guide the segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), thereby creating a basic 3DGS model of the target object. Then, we leverage large-scale diffusion priors to further refine the details of the 3DGS model, especially aimed at addressing invisible or occluded object portions from the original scene views. Subsequently, by re-rendering the 3DGS model onto the scene views, we achieve accurate object segmentation and effectively remove the background. Finally, these target-only images are used to improve the 3DGS model further and extract the definitive 3D object mesh by the SuGaR model. In various scenarios, our experiments demonstrate that OMEGAS significantly surpasses existing scene reconstruction methods. Our project page is at: https://github.com/CrystalWlz/OMEGAS</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Sterzinger, Simon Brenner, Robert Sablatnig</p>
<p>Abstract: Etruscan mirrors constitute a significant category within Etruscan art and, therefore, undergo systematic examinations to obtain insights into ancient times. A crucial aspect of their analysis involves the labor-intensive task of manually tracing engravings from the backside. Additionally, this task is inherently challenging due to the damage these mirrors have sustained, introducing subjectivity into the process. We address these challenges by automating the process through photometric-stereo scanning in conjunction with deep segmentation networks which, however, requires effective usage of the limited data at hand. We accomplish this by incorporating predictions on a per-patch level, and various data augmentations, as well as exploring self-supervised learning. Compared to our baseline, we improve predictive performance w.r.t. the pseudo-F-Measure by around 16%. When assessing performance on complete mirrors against a human baseline, our approach yields quantitative similar performance to a human annotator and significantly outperforms existing binarization methods. With our proposed methodology, we streamline the annotation process, enhance its objectivity, and reduce overall workload, offering a valuable contribution to the examination of these historical artifacts and other non-traditional documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinheng Xie, Jiajun Feng, Zhaoxu Tian, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Yawen Huang, Xi Xia, Nanxu Gong, Xu Zuo, Jiaqi Yang, Yefeng Zheng, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Concepts involved in long-form videos such as people, objects, and their interactions, can be viewed as following an implicit prior. They are notably complex and continue to pose challenges to be comprehensively learned. In recent years, generative pre-training (GPT) has exhibited versatile capacities in modeling any kind of text content even visual locations. Can this manner work for learning long-form video prior? Instead of operating on pixel space, it is efficient to employ visual locations like bounding boxes and keypoints to represent key information in videos, which can be simply discretized and then tokenized for consumption by GPT. Due to the scarcity of suitable data, we create a new dataset called \textbf{Storyboard20K} from movies to serve as a representative. It includes synopses, shot-by-shot keyframes, and fine-grained annotations of film sets and characters with consistent IDs, bounding boxes, and whole body keypoints. In this way, long-form videos can be represented by a set of tokens and be learned via generative pre-training. Experimental results validate that our approach has great potential for learning long-form video prior. Code and data will be released at \url{https://github.com/showlab/Long-form-Video-Prior}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuxin Chen, Yuheng Li, Mingzhe Hu, Ella Salari, Xiaoqian Chen, Richard L. J. Qiu, Bin Zheng, Xiaofeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although fusion of information from multiple views of mammograms plays an important role to increase accuracy of breast cancer detection, developing multi-view mammograms-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes still faces challenges and no such CAD schemes have been used in clinical practice. To overcome the challenges, we investigate a new approach based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which has sparked interest across various medical imaging tasks. By solving the challenges in (1) effectively adapting the single-view CLIP for multi-view feature fusion and (2) efficiently fine-tuning this parameter-dense model with limited samples and computational resources, we introduce Mammo-CLIP, the first multi-modal framework to process multi-view mammograms and corresponding simple texts. Mammo-CLIP uses an early feature fusion strategy to learn multi-view relationships in four mammograms acquired from the CC and MLO views of the left and right breasts. To enhance learning efficiency, plug-and-play adapters are added into CLIP image and text encoders for fine-tuning parameters and limiting updates to about 1% of the parameters. For framework evaluation, we assembled two datasets retrospectively. The first dataset, comprising 470 malignant and 479 benign cases, was used for few-shot fine-tuning and internal evaluation of the proposed Mammo-CLIP via 5-fold cross-validation. The second dataset, including 60 malignant and 294 benign cases, was used to test generalizability of Mammo-CLIP. Study results show that Mammo-CLIP outperforms the state-of-art cross-view transformer in AUC (0.841 vs. 0.817, 0.837 vs. 0.807) on both datasets. It also surpasses previous two CLIP-based methods by 20.3% and 14.3%. This study highlights the potential of applying the finetuned vision-language models for developing next-generation, image-text-based CAD schemes of breast cancer.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have led to the development of techniques to generate visually realistic synthetic video. While a number of techniques have been developed to detect AI-generated synthetic images, in this paper we show that synthetic image detectors are unable to detect synthetic videos. We demonstrate that this is because synthetic video generators introduce substantially different traces than those left by image generators. Despite this, we show that synthetic video traces can be learned, and used to perform reliable synthetic video detection or generator source attribution even after H.264 re-compression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while detecting videos from new generators through zero-shot transferability is challenging, accurate detection of videos from a new generator can be achieved through few-shot learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanwei Zhang, Ying Zhu, Dan Wang, Lijun Zhang, Tianxiang Chen, Zi Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: State space models (SSMs) with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architectures, namely Mamba, have recently demonstrated significant promise in long-sequence modeling. Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitrii Zhemchuzhnikov, Sergei Grudinin</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing volumetric data with rotational invariance or equivariance is an active topic in current research. Existing deep-learning approaches utilize either group convolutional networks limited to discrete rotations or steerable convolutional networks with constrained filter structures. This work proposes a novel equivariant neural network architecture that achieves analytical Equivariance to Local Pattern Orientation on the continuous SO(3) group while allowing unconstrained trainable filters - EquiLoPO Network. Our key innovations are a group convolutional operation leveraging irreducible representations as the Fourier basis and a local activation function in the SO(3) space that provides a well-defined mapping from input to output functions, preserving equivariance. By integrating these operations into a ResNet-style architecture, we propose a model that overcomes the limitations of prior methods. A comprehensive evaluation on diverse 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently outperforms state of the art. This work suggests the benefits of true rotational equivariance on SO(3) and flexible unconstrained filters enabled by the local activation function, providing a flexible framework for equivariant deep learning on volumetric data with potential applications across domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guosheng Lu, Zile Fang, Chunming He, Zhigang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to preserve thermal radiation information from infrared images while integrating texture details from visible images, enabling the capture of important features and hidden details of subjects in complex scenes and disturbed environments. Consequently, IVIF offers distinct advantages in practical applications such as video surveillance, night navigation, and target recognition. However, prevailing methods often face challenges in simultaneously capturing thermal region features and detailed information due to the disparate characteristics of infrared and visible images. Consequently, fusion outcomes frequently entail a compromise between thermal target area information and texture details. In this study, we introduce a novel heterogeneous dual-discriminator generative adversarial network (HDDGAN) to address this issue. Specifically, the generator is structured as a multi-scale skip-connected structure, facilitating the extraction of essential features from different source images. To enhance the information representation ability of the fusion result, an attention mechanism is employed to construct the information fusion layer within the generator, leveraging the disparities between the source images. Moreover, recognizing the distinct learning requirements of information in infrared and visible images, we design two discriminators with differing structures. This approach aims to guide the model to learn salient information from infrared images while simultaneously capturing detailed information from visible images. Extensive experiments conducted on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HDDGAN over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, highlighting its enhanced potential for practical applications.</p>

MedIMeta contains 19 medical imaging datasets spanning 10 different domains and encompassing 54 distinct medical tasks, all of which are standardized to the same format and readily usable in PyTorch or other ML frameworks. We perform a technical validation of MedIMeta, demonstrating its utility through fully supervised and cross-domain few-shot learning baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show significant strides in general-purpose multimodal applications such as visual dialogue and embodied navigation. However, existing multimodal evaluation benchmarks cover a limited number of multimodal tasks testing rudimentary capabilities, falling short in tracking LVLM development. In this study, we present MMT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LVLMs across massive multimodal tasks requiring expert knowledge and deliberate visual recognition, localization, reasoning, and planning. MMT-Bench comprises $31,325$ meticulously curated multi-choice visual questions from various multimodal scenarios such as vehicle driving and embodied navigation, covering $32$ core meta-tasks and $162$ subtasks in multimodal understanding. Due to its extensive task coverage, MMT-Bench enables the evaluation of LVLMs using a task map, facilitating the discovery of in- and out-of-domain tasks. Evaluation results involving $30$ LVLMs such as the proprietary GPT-4V, GeminiProVision, and open-sourced InternVL-Chat, underscore the significant challenges posed by MMT-Bench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyusun Cho, Joungbin Lee, Heeji Yoon, Yeobin Hong, Jaehoon Ko, Sangjun Ahn, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose GaussianTalker, a novel framework for real-time generation of pose-controllable talking heads. It leverages the fast rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) while addressing the challenges of directly controlling 3DGS with speech audio. GaussianTalker constructs a canonical 3DGS representation of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. A key insight is to encode the 3D Gaussian attributes into a shared implicit feature representation, where it is merged with audio features to manipulate each Gaussian attribute. This design exploits the spatial-aware features and enforces interactions between neighboring points. The feature embeddings are then fed to a spatial-audio attention module, which predicts frame-wise offsets for the attributes of each Gaussian. It is more stable than previous concatenation or multiplication approaches for manipulating the numerous Gaussians and their intricate parameters. Experimental results showcase GaussianTalker's superiority in facial fidelity, lip synchronization accuracy, and rendering speed compared to previous methods. Specifically, GaussianTalker achieves a remarkable rendering speed of 120 FPS, surpassing previous benchmarks. Our code is made available at https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/GaussianTalker/ .</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the RetinaRegNet model, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various retinal image registration tasks. RetinaRegNet does not require training on any retinal images. It begins by establishing point correspondences between two retinal images using image features derived from diffusion models. This process involves the selection of feature points from the moving image using the SIFT algorithm alongside random point sampling. For each selected feature point, a 2D correlation map is computed by assessing the similarity between the feature vector at that point and the feature vectors of all pixels in the fixed image. The pixel with the highest similarity score in the correlation map corresponds to the feature point in the moving image. To remove outliers in the estimated point correspondences, we first applied an inverse consistency constraint, followed by a transformation-based outlier detector. This method proved to outperform the widely used random sample consensus (RANSAC) outlier detector by a significant margin. To handle large deformations, we utilized a two-stage image registration framework. A homography transformation was used in the first stage and a more accurate third-order polynomial transformation was used in the second stage. The model's effectiveness was demonstrated across three retinal image datasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser speckle flowgraphy images. RetinaRegNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in all three datasets. It was especially effective for registering image pairs with large displacement and scaling deformations. This innovation holds promise for various applications in retinal image analysis. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/RetinaRegNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advances in text-guided synthesis tasks. However, editing user-provided images remains challenging, as the high dimensional noise input space of diffusion models is not naturally suited for image inversion or spatial editing. In this work, we propose an image representation that promotes spatial editing of input images using a diffusion model. Concretely, we learn to encode an input into "image elements" that can faithfully reconstruct an input image. These elements can be intuitively edited by a user, and are decoded by a diffusion model into realistic images. We show the effectiveness of our representation on various image editing tasks, such as object resizing, rearrangement, dragging, de-occlusion, removal, variation, and image composition.

<p>Abstract: The success of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) relies on the supervision from the pairing between images and captions, which tends to be noisy in web-crawled data. We present Mixture of Data Experts (MoDE) and learn a system of CLIP data experts via clustering. Each data expert is trained on one data cluster, being less sensitive to false negative noises in other clusters. At inference time, we ensemble their outputs by applying weights determined through the correlation between task metadata and cluster conditions. To estimate the correlation precisely, the samples in one cluster should be semantically similar, but the number of data experts should still be reasonable for training and inference. As such, we consider the ontology in human language and propose to use fine-grained cluster centers to represent each data expert at a coarse-grained level. Experimental studies show that four CLIP data experts on ViT-B/16 outperform the ViT-L/14 by OpenAI CLIP and OpenCLIP on zero-shot image classification but with less ($<$35\%) training cost. Meanwhile, MoDE can train all data expert asynchronously and can flexibly include new data experts. The code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/tree/main/mode.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timin Gao, Peixian Chen, Mengdan Zhang, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Yan Zhang, Shengchuan Zhang, Xiawu Zheng, Xing Sun, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain-of-thought(CoT) methodology, visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub-tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools. However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential "determining hallucinations" in decision-making due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning. We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks. This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture. Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context. Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuong Huynh, Seoung Wug Oh, Abhinav Shrivastava, Joon-Young Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Human matting is a foundation task in image and video processing, where human foreground pixels are extracted from the input. Prior works either improve the accuracy by additional guidance or improve the temporal consistency of a single instance across frames. We propose a new framework MaGGIe, Masked Guided Gradual Human Instance Matting, which predicts alpha mattes progressively for each human instances while maintaining the computational cost, precision, and consistency. Our method leverages modern architectures, including transformer attention and sparse convolution, to output all instance mattes simultaneously without exploding memory and latency. Although keeping constant inference costs in the multiple-instance scenario, our framework achieves robust and versatile performance on our proposed synthesized benchmarks. With the higher quality image and video matting benchmarks, the novel multi-instance synthesis approach from publicly available sources is introduced to increase the generalization of models in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Lackner, Behrus Puladi, Jens Kleesiek, Jan Egger, Jianning Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In traumatic medical emergencies, the patients heavily depend on cranioplasty - the craft of neurocranial repair using cranial implants. Despite the improvements made in recent years, the design of a patient-specific implant (PSI) is among the most complex, expensive, and least automated tasks in cranioplasty. Further research in this area is needed. Therefore, we created a prototype application with a graphical user interface (UI) specifically tailored for semi-automatic implant generation, where the users only need to perform high-level actions. A general outline of the proposed implant generation process involves setting an area of interest, aligning the templates, and then creating the implant in voxel space. Furthermore, we show that the alignment can be improved significantly, by only considering clipped geometry in the vicinity of the defect border. The software prototype will be open-sourced at https://github.com/3Descape/Cranial_Implant_Design</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanmuga Venkatachalam, Harideep Nair, Prabhu Vellaisamy, Yongqi Zhou, Ziad Youssfi, John Paul Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Each person has a unique gait, i.e., walking style, that can be used as a biometric for personal identification. Recent works have demonstrated effective gait recognition using deep neural networks, however most of these works predominantly focus on classification accuracy rather than model efficiency. In order to perform gait recognition using wearable devices on the edge, it is imperative to develop highly efficient low-power models that can be deployed on to small form-factor devices such as microcontrollers. In this paper, we propose a small CNN model with 4 layers that is very amenable for edge AI deployment and realtime gait recognition. This model was trained on a public gait dataset with 20 classes augmented with data collected by the authors, aggregating to 24 classes in total. Our model achieves 96.7% accuracy and consumes only 5KB RAM with an inferencing time of 70 ms and 125mW power, while running continuous inference on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. We successfully demonstrated realtime identification of the authors with the model running on Arduino, thus underscoring the efficacy and providing a proof of feasiblity for deployment in practical systems in near future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James K Ruffle, Samia Mohinta, Kelly Pegoretti Baruteau, Rebekah Rajiah, Faith Lee, Sebastian Brandner, Parashkev Nachev, Harpreet Hyare</p>
<p>Abstract: The VASARI MRI feature set is a quantitative system designed to standardise glioma imaging descriptions. Though effective, deriving VASARI is time-consuming and seldom used in clinical practice. This is a problem that machine learning could plausibly automate. Using glioma data from 1172 patients, we developed VASARI-auto, an automated labelling software applied to both open-source lesion masks and our openly available tumour segmentation model. In parallel, two consultant neuroradiologists independently quantified VASARI features in a subsample of 100 glioblastoma cases. We quantified: 1) agreement across neuroradiologists and VASARI-auto; 2) calibration of performance equity; 3) an economic workforce analysis; and 4) fidelity in predicting patient survival. Tumour segmentation was compatible with the current state of the art and equally performant regardless of age or sex. A modest inter-rater variability between in-house neuroradiologists was comparable to between neuroradiologists and VASARI-auto, with far higher agreement between VASARI-auto methods. The time taken for neuroradiologists to derive VASARI was substantially higher than VASARI-auto (mean time per case 317 vs. 3 seconds). A UK hospital workforce analysis forecast that three years of VASARI featurisation would demand 29,777 consultant neuroradiologist workforce hours ({\pounds}1,574,935), reducible to 332 hours of computing time (and {\pounds}146 of power) with VASARI-auto. The best-performing survival model utilised VASARI-auto features as opposed to those derived by neuroradiologists. VASARI-auto is a highly efficient automated labelling system with equitable performance across patient age or sex, a favourable economic profile if used as a decision support tool, and with non-inferior fidelity in downstream patient survival prediction. Future work should iterate upon and integrate such tools to enhance patient care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikolaj Czerkawski, Christos Ilioudis, Carmine Clemente, Craig Michie, Ivan Andonovic, Christos Tachtatzis</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques are subject to increasing adoption for a wide range of micro-Doppler applications, where predictions need to be made based on time-frequency signal representations. Most, if not all, of the reported applications focus on translating an existing deep learning framework to this new domain with no adjustment made to the objective function. This practice results in a missed opportunity to encourage the model to prioritize features that are particularly relevant for micro-Doppler applications. Thus the paper introduces a micro-Doppler coherence loss, minimized when the normalized power of micro-Doppler oscillatory components between input and output is matched. The experiments conducted on real data show that the application of the introduced loss results in models more resilient to noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhuo Wu, Ang Li, Mohammadreza Beikmirza, Gagan Deep Singh, Qinyu Chen, Leo C. N. de Vreede, Morteza Alavi, Chang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) enhances signal quality in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). As signal bandwidths expand in modern radio systems, DPD's energy consumption increasingly impacts overall system efficiency. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offer promising advancements in DPD, yet their high complexity hinders their practical deployment. This paper introduces open-source mixed-precision (MP) neural networks that employ quantized low-precision fixed-point parameters for energy-efficient DPD. This approach reduces computational complexity and memory footprint, thereby lowering power consumption without compromising linearization efficacy. Applied to a 160MHz-BW 1024-QAM OFDM signal from a digital RF PA, MP-DPD gives no performance loss against 32-bit floating-point precision DPDs, while achieving -43.75 (L)/-45.27 (R) dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) and -38.72 dB in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). A 16-bit fixed-point-precision MP-DPD enables a 2.8X reduction in estimated inference power.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael F. Oliveira, Gladston J. P. Moreira, Vander L. S. Freitas, Eduardo J. S. Luz</p>
<p>Abstract: Arrhythmias, detectable via electrocardiograms (ECGs), pose significant health risks, emphasizing the need for robust automated identification techniques. Although traditional deep learning methods have shown potential, recent advances in graph-based strategies are aimed at enhancing arrhythmia detection performance. However, effectively representing ECG signals as graphs remains a challenge. This study explores graph representations of ECG signals using Visibility Graph (VG) and Vector Visibility Graph (VVG), coupled with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for arrhythmia classification. Through experiments on the MIT-BIH dataset, we investigated various GCN architectures and preprocessing parameters. The results reveal that GCNs, when integrated with VG and VVG for signal graph mapping, can classify arrhythmias without the need for preprocessing or noise removal from ECG signals. While both VG and VVG methods show promise, VG is notably more efficient. The proposed approach was competitive compared to baseline methods, although classifying the S class remains challenging, especially under the inter-patient paradigm. Computational complexity, particularly with the VVG method, required data balancing and sophisticated implementation strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Manisha, Nitin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Cancelable Biometric is repetitive distortion embedded in original Biometric image for keeping it secure from unauthorized access. In this paper, we have generated Cancelable Biometric templates with Reverse Boolean XOR technique. Three different methods have been proposed for generation of Cancelable Biometric templates based on Visual Secret Sharing scheme. In each method, one Secret image and n-1 Cover images are used as: (M1) One original Biometric image (Secret) with n- 1 randomly chosen Gray Cover images (M2) One original Secret image with n-1 Cover images, which are Randomly Permuted version of the original Secret image (M3) One Secret image with n-1 Cover images, both Secret image and Cover images are Randomly Permuted version of original Biometric image. Experiment works have performed on publicly available ORL Face database and IIT Delhi Iris database. The performance of the proposed methods is compared in terms of Co-relation Coefficient (Cr), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI). It is found that among the three proposed method, M3 generates good quality Cancelable templates and gives best performance in terms of quality. M3 is also better in quantitative terms on ORL dataset while M2 and M3 are comparable on IIT Delhi Iris dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhang Lin, Wenyue Hua, Lingyao Li, Che-Jui Chang, Lizhou Fan, Jianchao Ji, Hang Hua, Mingyu Jin, Jiebo Luo, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents BattleAgent, an emulation system that combines the Large Vision-Language Model and Multi-agent System. This novel system aims to simulate complex dynamic interactions among multiple agents, as well as between agents and their environments, over a period of time. It emulates both the decision-making processes of leaders and the viewpoints of ordinary participants, such as soldiers. The emulation showcases the current capabilities of agents, featuring fine-grained multi-modal interactions between agents and landscapes. It develops customizable agent structures to meet specific situational requirements, for example, a variety of battle-related activities like scouting and trench digging. These components collaborate to recreate historical events in a lively and comprehensive manner while offering insights into the thoughts and feelings of individuals from diverse viewpoints. The technological foundations of BattleAgent establish detailed and immersive settings for historical battles, enabling individual agents to partake in, observe, and dynamically respond to evolving battle scenarios. This methodology holds the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of historical events, particularly through individual accounts. Such initiatives can also aid historical research, as conventional historical narratives often lack documentation and prioritize the perspectives of decision-makers, thereby overlooking the experiences of ordinary individuals. BattelAgent illustrates AI's potential to revitalize the human aspect in crucial social events, thereby fostering a more nuanced collective understanding and driving the progressive development of human society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Xu, Longdu Liu, Ningna Wang, Shuangmin Chen, Shiqing Xin, Xiaohu Guo, Zichun Zhong, Taku Komura, Wenping Wang, Changhe Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: In mesh simplification, common requirements like accuracy, triangle quality, and feature alignment are often considered as a trade-off. Existing algorithms concentrate on just one or a few specific aspects of these requirements. For example, the well-known Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) approach prioritizes accuracy and can preserve strong feature lines/points as well but falls short in ensuring high triangle quality and may degrade weak features that are not as distinctive as strong ones. In this paper, we propose a smooth functional that simultaneously considers all of these requirements. The functional comprises a normal anisotropy term and a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) energy term, with the variables being a set of movable points lying on the surface. The former inherits the spirit of QEM but operates in a continuous setting, while the latter encourages even point distribution, allowing various surface metrics. We further introduce a decaying weight to automatically balance the two terms. We selected 100 CAD models from the ABC dataset, along with 21 organic models, to compare the existing mesh simplification algorithms with ours. Experimental results reveal an important observation: the introduction of a decaying weight effectively reduces the conflict between the two terms and enables the alignment of weak features. This distinctive feature sets our approach apart from most existing mesh simplification methods and demonstrates significant potential in shape understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite considerable strides in developing deep learning models for 3D medical image segmentation, the challenge of effectively generalizing across diverse image distributions persists. While domain generalization is acknowledged as vital for robust application in clinical settings, the challenges stemming from training with a limited Field of View (FOV) remain unaddressed. This limitation leads to false predictions when applied to body regions beyond the FOV of the training data. In response to this problem, we propose a novel loss function that penalizes predictions in implausible body regions, applicable in both single-dataset and multi-dataset training schemes. It is realized with a Body Part Regression model that generates axial slice positional scores. Through comprehensive evaluation using a test set featuring varying FOVs, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in generalization capabilities. It effectively mitigates false positive tumor predictions up to 85% and significantly enhances overall segmentation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Doerrich, Francesco Di Salvo, Julius Brockmann, Christian Ledig</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of deep learning based systems in clinical practice is often impeded by challenges rooted in limited and heterogeneous medical datasets. In addition, prioritization of marginal performance improvements on a few, narrowly scoped benchmarks over clinical applicability has slowed down meaningful algorithmic progress. This trend often results in excessive fine-tuning of existing methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on selected datasets rather than fostering clinically relevant innovations. In response, this work presents a comprehensive benchmark for the MedMNIST+ database to diversify the evaluation landscape and conduct a thorough analysis of common convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures, for medical image classification. Our evaluation encompasses various medical datasets, training methodologies, and input resolutions, aiming to reassess the strengths and limitations of widely used model variants. Our findings suggest that computationally efficient training schemes and modern foundation models hold promise in bridging the gap between expensive end-to-end training and more resource-refined approaches. Additionally, contrary to prevailing assumptions, we observe that higher resolutions may not consistently improve performance beyond a certain threshold, advocating for the use of lower resolutions, particularly in prototyping stages, to expedite processing. Notably, our analysis reaffirms the competitiveness of convolutional models compared to ViT-based architectures emphasizing the importance of comprehending the intrinsic capabilities of different model architectures. Moreover, we hope that our standardized evaluation framework will help enhance transparency, reproducibility, and comparability on the MedMNIST+ dataset collection as well as future research within the field. Code will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Russell Buchanan, S. Jack Tu, Marco Camurri, Stephen J. Mellon, Maurice Fallon</p>
<p>Abstract: Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) issues affect one in four people, with 20% experiencing chronic knee pain despite treatment. Poor outcomes and pain after knee replacement surgery are often linked to patellar mal-tracking. Traditional imaging methods like CT and MRI face challenges, including cost and metal artefacts, and there's currently no ideal way to observe joint motion without issues such as soft tissue artefacts or radiation exposure. A new system to monitor joint motion could significantly improve understanding of PFJ dynamics, aiding in better patient care and outcomes. Combining 2D ultrasound with motion tracking for 3D reconstruction of the joint using semantic segmentation and position registration can be a solution. However, the need for expensive external infrastructure to estimate the trajectories of the scanner remains the main limitation to implementing 3D bone reconstruction from handheld ultrasound scanning clinically. We proposed the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the deep learning-based inertial-only odometry methods as alternatives to motion capture for tracking a handheld ultrasound scanner. The 3D reconstruction generated by these methods has demonstrated potential for assessing the PFJ and for further measurements from free-hand ultrasound scans. The results show that the VIO method performs as well as the motion capture method, with average reconstruction errors of 1.25 mm and 1.21 mm, respectively. The VIO method is the first infrastructure-free method for 3D reconstruction of bone from wireless handheld ultrasound scanning with an accuracy comparable to methods that require external infrastructure.</p>

After the training, the best model has been selected from the evaluation metrics. Among the models, CNN with backbone of ResNet50 performs best which gives the training accuracy of 98.7\% for 90\% train and 10\% test data split.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Hu, Hanchi Ren, Chen Hu, Jingjing Deng, Xianghua Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a powerful Machine Learning (ML) paradigm that enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping the data on the original device, thereby preserving privacy. A central challenge in FL is the effective aggregation of local model weights from disparate and potentially unbalanced participating clients. Existing methods often treat each client indiscriminately, applying a single proportion to the entire local model. However, it is empirically advantageous for each weight to be assigned a specific proportion. This paper introduces an innovative Element-Wise Weights Aggregation Method for Federated Learning (EWWA-FL) aimed at optimizing learning performance and accelerating convergence speed. Unlike traditional FL approaches, EWWA-FL aggregates local weights to the global model at the level of individual elements, thereby allowing each participating client to make element-wise contributions to the learning process. By taking into account the unique dataset characteristics of each client, EWWA-FL enhances the robustness of the global model to different datasets while also achieving rapid convergence. The method is flexible enough to employ various weighting strategies. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the advanced capabilities of EWWA-FL, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and convergence speed across a range of backbones and benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human gaze provides valuable information on human focus and intentions, making it a crucial area of research. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized appearance-based gaze estimation. However, due to the unique features of gaze estimation research, such as the unfair comparison between 2D gaze positions and 3D gaze vectors and the different pre-processing and post-processing methods, there is a lack of a definitive guideline for developing deep learning-based gaze estimation algorithms. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the appearance-based gaze estimation methods using deep learning. Firstly, we survey the existing gaze estimation algorithms along the typical gaze estimation pipeline: deep feature extraction, deep learning model design, personal calibration and platforms. Secondly, to fairly compare the performance of different approaches, we summarize the data pre-processing and post-processing methods, including face/eye detection, data rectification, 2D/3D gaze conversion and gaze origin conversion. Finally, we set up a comprehensive benchmark for deep learning-based gaze estimation. We characterize all the public datasets and provide the source code of typical gaze estimation algorithms. This paper serves not only as a reference to develop deep learning-based gaze estimation methods, but also a guideline for future gaze estimation research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinmin Zhang, Xinzhu Ma, Shuai Yi, Jun Hou, Zhihui Wang, Wanli Ouyang, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: As a crucial task of autonomous driving, 3D object detection has made great progress in recent years. However, monocular 3D object detection remains a challenging problem due to the unsatisfactory performance in depth estimation. Most existing monocular methods typically directly regress the scene depth while ignoring important relationships between the depth and various geometric elements (e.g. bounding box sizes, 3D object dimensions, and object poses). In this paper, we propose to learn geometry-guided depth estimation with projective modeling to advance monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, a principled geometry formula with projective modeling of 2D and 3D depth predictions in the monocular 3D object detection network is devised. We further implement and embed the proposed formula to enable geometry-aware deep representation learning, allowing effective 2D and 3D interactions for boosting the depth estimation. Moreover, we provide a strong baseline through addressing substantial misalignment between 2D annotation and projected boxes to ensure robust learning with the proposed geometric formula. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our method remarkably improves the detection performance of the state-of-the-art monocular-based method without extra data by 2.80% on the moderate test setting. The model and code will be released at https://github.com/YinminZhang/MonoGeo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shu Liu, Enquan Huang, Ziyu Zhou, Yan Xu, Xiaoyan Kui, Tao Lei, Hongying Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial attractiveness prediction (FAP) aims to assess facial attractiveness automatically based on human aesthetic perception. Previous methods using deep convolutional neural networks have improved the performance, but their large-scale models have led to a deficiency in flexibility. In addition, most methods fail to take full advantage of the dataset. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end FAP approach that integrates dual label distribution and lightweight design. The manual ratings, attractiveness score, and standard deviation are aggregated explicitly to construct a dual-label distribution to make the best use of the dataset, including the attractiveness distribution and the rating distribution. Such distributions, as well as the attractiveness score, are optimized under a joint learning framework based on the label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm. The data processing is simplified to a minimum for a lightweight design, and MobileNetV2 is selected as our backbone. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, where our approach achieves promising results and succeeds in balancing performance and efficiency. Ablation studies demonstrate that our delicately designed learning modules are indispensable and correlated.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitian Zheng, Zhe Lin, Jingwan Lu, Scott Cohen, Eli Shechtman, Connelly Barnes, Jianming Zhang, Qing Liu, Yuqian Zhou, Sohrab Amirghodsi, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Structure-guided image completion aims to inpaint a local region of an image according to an input guidance map from users. While such a task enables many practical applications for interactive editing, existing methods often struggle to hallucinate realistic object instances in complex natural scenes. Such a limitation is partially due to the lack of semantic-level constraints inside the hole region as well as the lack of a mechanism to enforce realistic object generation. In this work, we propose a learning paradigm that consists of semantic discriminators and object-level discriminators for improving the generation of complex semantics and objects. Specifically, the semantic discriminators leverage pretrained visual features to improve the realism of the generated visual concepts. Moreover, the object-level discriminators take aligned instances as inputs to enforce the realism of individual objects. Our proposed scheme significantly improves the generation quality and achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks, including segmentation-guided completion, edge-guided manipulation and panoptically-guided manipulation on Places2 datasets. Furthermore, our trained model is flexible and can support multiple editing use cases, such as object insertion, replacement, removal and standard inpainting. In particular, our trained model combined with a novel automatic image completion pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard inpainting task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej Grci\'c, Sini\v{s}a \v{S}egvi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-set segmentation can be conceived by complementing closed-set classification with anomaly detection. Many of the existing dense anomaly detectors operate through generative modelling of regular data or by discriminating with respect to negative data. These two approaches optimize different objectives and therefore exhibit different failure modes. Consequently, we propose a novel anomaly score that fuses generative and discriminative cues. Our score can be implemented by upgrading any closed-set segmentation model with dense estimates of dataset posterior and unnormalized data likelihood. The resulting dense hybrid open-set models require negative training images that can be sampled from an auxiliary negative dataset, from a jointly trained generative model, or from a mixture of both sources. We evaluate our contributions on benchmarks for dense anomaly detection and open-set segmentation. The experiments reveal strong open-set performance in spite of negligible computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinye Wanyan, Sachith Seneviratne, Shuchang Shen, Michael Kirley</p>
<p>Abstract: Since large number of high-quality remote sensing images are readily accessible, exploiting the corpus of images with less manual annotation draws increasing attention. Self-supervised models acquire general feature representations by formulating a pretext task that generates pseudo-labels for massive unlabeled data to provide supervision for training. While prior studies have explored multiple self-supervised learning techniques in remote sensing domain, pretext tasks based on local-global view alignment remain underexplored, despite achieving state-of-the-art results on natural imagery. Inspired by DINO, which employs an effective representation learning structure with knowledge distillation based on global-local view alignment, we formulate two pretext tasks for self-supervised learning on remote sensing imagery (SSLRS). Using these tasks, we explore the effectiveness of positive temporal contrast as well as multi-sized views on SSLRS. We extend DINO and propose DINO-MC which uses local views of various sized crops instead of a single fixed size in order to alleviate the limited variation in object size observed in remote sensing imagery. Our experiments demonstrate that even when pre-trained on only 10% of the dataset, DINO-MC performs on par or better than existing state-of-the-art SSLRS methods on multiple remote sensing tasks, while using less computational resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Delmas, Amine Kacete, Stephane Paquelet, Simon Leglaive, Renaud Seguier</p>
<p>Abstract: The classification of forged videos has been a challenge for the past few years. Deepfake classifiers can now reliably predict whether or not video frames have been tampered with. However, their performance is tied to both the dataset used for training and the analyst's computational power. We propose a deepfake detection method that operates in the latent space of a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on high-quality face images. The proposed method leverages the structure of the latent space of StyleGAN to learn a lightweight binary classification model. Experimental results on standard datasets reveal that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art deepfake classification methods, especially in contexts where the data available to train the models is rare, such as when a new manipulation method is introduced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the interest of the latent space of StyleGAN for deepfake classification. Combined with other recent studies on the interpretation and manipulation of this latent space, we believe that the proposed approach can further help in developing frugal deepfake classification methods based on interpretable high-level properties of face images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erh-Chung Chen, Pin-Yu Chen, I-Hsin Chung, Che-rung Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, the deployment of deep learning-based applications is an essential task owing to the increasing demands on intelligent services. In this paper, we investigate latency attacks on deep learning applications. Unlike common adversarial attacks for misclassification, the goal of latency attacks is to increase the inference time, which may stop applications from responding to the requests within a reasonable time. This kind of attack is ubiquitous for various applications, and we use object detection to demonstrate how such kind of attacks work. We also design a framework named Overload to generate latency attacks at scale. Our method is based on a newly formulated optimization problem and a novel technique, called spatial attention. This attack serves to escalate the required computing costs during the inference time, consequently leading to an extended inference time for object detection. It presents a significant threat, especially to systems with limited computing resources. We conducted experiments using YOLOv5 models on Nvidia NX. Compared to existing methods, our method is simpler and more effective. The experimental results show that with latency attacks, the inference time of a single image can be increased ten times longer in reference to the normal setting. Moreover, our findings pose a potential new threat to all object detection tasks requiring non-maximum suppression (NMS), as our attack is NMS-agnostic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Wang, Huan Yang, Zixi Tuo, Huiguo He, Junchen Zhu, Jianlong Fu, Jiaying Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosive popularity of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has recently received a lot of attention. Generating videos guided by text instructions poses significant challenges, such as modeling the complex relationship between space and time, and the lack of large-scale text-video paired data. Existing text-video datasets suffer from limitations in both content quality and scale, or they are not open-source, rendering them inaccessible for study and use. For model design, previous approaches extend pretrained text-to-image generation models by adding temporal 1D convolution/attention modules for video generation. However, these approaches overlook the importance of jointly modeling space and time, inevitably leading to temporal distortions and misalignment between texts and videos. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that strengthens the interaction between spatial and temporal perceptions. In particular, we utilize a swapped cross-attention mechanism in 3D windows that alternates the "query" role between spatial and temporal blocks, enabling mutual reinforcement for each other. Moreover, to fully unlock model capabilities for high-quality video generation and promote the development of the field, we curate a large-scale and open-source video dataset called HD-VG-130M. This dataset comprises 130 million text-video pairs from the open-domain, ensuring high-definition, widescreen and watermark-free characters. A smaller-scale yet more meticulously cleaned subset further enhances the data quality, aiding models in achieving superior performance. Experimental quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of per-frame quality, temporal correlation, and text-video alignment, with clear margins.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, facilitating the creation of hyper-realistic images from textual descriptions, has concurrently escalated critical societal concerns such as misinformation. Although providing some mitigation, traditional fingerprinting mechanisms fall short in attributing responsibility for the malicious use of synthetic images. This paper introduces a novel approach to model fingerprinting that assigns responsibility for the generated images, thereby serving as a potential countermeasure to model misuse. Our method modifies generative models based on each user's unique digital fingerprint, imprinting a unique identifier onto the resultant content that can be traced back to the user. This approach, incorporating fine-tuning into Text-to-Image (T2I) tasks using the Stable Diffusion Model, demonstrates near-perfect attribution accuracy with a minimal impact on output quality. Through extensive evaluation, we show that our method outperforms baseline methods with an average improvement of 11\% in handling image post-processes. Our method presents a promising and novel avenue for accountable model distribution and responsible use. Our code is available in \url{https://github.com/kylemin/WOUAF}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqiu Chen, Hang Yang, Stephen Fitzmeyer, Cong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) is an innovative approach for representing complex shapes or objects without explicitly defining their geometry or surface structure. Instead, INR represents objects as continuous functions. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of using neural networks as INR for image compression, showcasing comparable performance to traditional methods such as JPEG. However, INR holds potential for various applications beyond image compression. This paper introduces Rapid-INR, a novel approach that utilizes INR for encoding and compressing images, thereby accelerating neural network training in computer vision tasks. Our methodology involves storing the whole dataset directly in INR format on a GPU, mitigating the significant data communication overhead between the CPU and GPU during training. Additionally, the decoding process from INR to RGB format is highly parallelized and executed on-the-fly. To further enhance compression, we propose iterative and dynamic pruning, as well as layer-wise quantization, building upon previous work. We evaluate our framework on the image classification task, utilizing the ResNet-18 backbone network and three commonly used datasets with varying image sizes. Rapid-INR reduces memory consumption to only about 5% of the original dataset size in RGB format and achieves a maximum 6$\times$ speedup over the PyTorch training pipeline, as well as a maximum 1.2x speedup over the DALI training pipeline, with only a marginal decrease in accuracy. Importantly, Rapid-INR can be readily applied to other computer vision tasks and backbone networks with reasonable engineering efforts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Qiao, Zehuan Yu, Binqian Jiang, Huan Yin, Shaojie Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, G3Reg, for fast and robust global registration of LiDAR point clouds. In contrast to conventional complex keypoints and descriptors, we extract fundamental geometric primitives, including planes, clusters, and lines (PCL) from the raw point cloud to obtain low-level semantic segments. Each segment is represented as a unified Gaussian Ellipsoid Model (GEM), using a probability ellipsoid to ensure the ground truth centers are encompassed with a certain degree of probability. Utilizing these GEMs, we present a distrust-and-verify scheme based on a Pyramid Compatibility Graph for Global Registration (PAGOR). Specifically, we establish an upper bound, which can be traversed based on the confidence level for compatibility testing to construct the pyramid graph. Then, we solve multiple maximum cliques (MAC) for each level of the pyramid graph, thus generating the corresponding transformation candidates. In the verification phase, we adopt a precise and efficient metric for point cloud alignment quality, founded on geometric primitives, to identify the optimal candidate. The algorithm's performance is validated on three publicly available datasets and a self-collected multi-session dataset. Parameter settings remained unchanged during the experiment evaluations. The results exhibit superior robustness and real-time performance of the G3Reg framework compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential for integrating individual GEM and PAGOR components into other registration frameworks to enhance their efficacy.

<p>Abstract: Nearest neighbors (NN) are traditionally used to compute final decisions, e.g., in Support Vector Machines or k-NN classifiers, and to provide users with explanations for the model's decision. In this paper, we show a novel utility of nearest neighbors: To improve predictions of a frozen, pretrained classifier C. We leverage an image comparator S that (1) compares the input image with NN images from the top-K most probable classes; and (2) uses S's output scores to weight the confidence scores of C. Our method consistently improves fine-grained image classification accuracy on CUB-200, Cars-196, and Dogs-120. Also, a human study finds that showing lay users our probable-class nearest neighbors (PCNN) improves their decision accuracy over prior work which only shows only the top-1 class examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Zhang, Siyi Gu, Bo Pan, Guangji Bai, Meikang Qiu, Xiaofeng Yang, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual explanation (attention)-guided learning uses not only labels but also explanations to guide model reasoning process. While visual attention-guided learning has shown promising results, it requires a large number of explanation annotations that are time-consuming to prepare. However, in many real-world situations, it is usually desired to prompt the model with visual attention without model retraining. For example, when doing AI-assisted cancer classification on a medical image, users (e.g., clinicians) can provide the AI model with visual attention prompt on which areas are indispensable and which are precluded. Despite its promising objectives, achieving visual attention-prompted prediction presents several major challenges: 1) How can the visual prompt be effectively integrated into the model's reasoning process? 2) How should the model handle samples that lack visual prompts? 3) What is the impact on the model's performance when a visual prompt is imperfect? This paper introduces a novel framework for attention-prompted prediction and learning, utilizing visual prompts to steer the model's reasoning process. To improve performance in non-prompted situations and align it with prompted scenarios, we propose a co-training approach for both non-prompted and prompted models, ensuring they share similar parameters and activations. Additionally, for instances where the visual prompt does not encompass the entire input image, we have developed innovative attention prompt refinement methods. These methods interpolate the incomplete prompts while maintaining alignment with the model's explanations. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing predictions for samples both with and without prompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taekyung Kim, Sanghyuk Chun, Byeongho Heo, Dongyoon Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked image modeling (MIM) has become a leading self-supervised learning strategy. MIMs such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) learn strong representations by randomly masking input tokens for the encoder to process, with the decoder reconstructing the masked tokens to the input. However, MIM pre-trained encoders often exhibit a limited attention span, attributed to MIM's sole focus on regressing masked tokens only, which may impede the encoder's broader context learning. To tackle the limitation, we improve MIM by explicitly incorporating unmasked tokens into the training process. Specifically, our method enables the encoder to learn from broader context supervision, allowing unmasked tokens to experience broader contexts while the decoder reconstructs masked tokens. Thus, the encoded unmasked tokens are equipped with extensive contextual information, empowering masked tokens to leverage the enhanced unmasked tokens for MIM. As a result, our simple remedy trains more discriminative representations revealed by achieving 84.2% top-1 accuracy with ViT-B on ImageNet-1K with 0.6%p gain. We attribute the success to the enhanced pre-training method, as evidenced by the singular value spectrum and attention analyses. Finally, our models achieve significant performance gains at the downstream semantic segmentation and fine-grained visual classification tasks; and on diverse robust evaluation metrics.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a 3D-aware diffusion model, ZeroNVS, for single-image novel view synthesis for in-the-wild scenes. While existing methods are designed for single objects with masked backgrounds, we propose new techniques to address challenges introduced by in-the-wild multi-object scenes with complex backgrounds. Specifically, we train a generative prior on a mixture of data sources that capture object-centric, indoor, and outdoor scenes. To address issues from data mixture such as depth-scale ambiguity, we propose a novel camera conditioning parameterization and normalization scheme. Further, we observe that Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) tends to truncate the distribution of complex backgrounds during distillation of 360-degree scenes, and propose "SDS anchoring" to improve the diversity of synthesized novel views. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art result in LPIPS on the DTU dataset in the zero-shot setting, even outperforming methods specifically trained on DTU. We further adapt the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 dataset as a new benchmark for single-image novel view synthesis, and demonstrate strong performance in this setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiwen Chen, Yingtie Lei, Shenghong Luo, Ziyang Zhou, Mingxian Li, Chi-Man Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater images often exhibit poor quality, distorted color balance and low contrast due to the complex and intricate interplay of light, water, and objects. Despite the significant contributions of previous underwater enhancement techniques, there exist several problems that demand further improvement: (i) The current deep learning methods rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that lack the multi-scale enhancement, and global perception field is also limited. (ii) The scarcity of paired real-world underwater datasets poses a significant challenge, and the utilization of synthetic image pairs could lead to overfitting. To address the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces a Multi-scale Transformer-based Network called UWFormer for enhancing images at multiple frequencies via semi-supervised learning, in which we propose a Nonlinear Frequency-aware Attention mechanism and a Multi-Scale Fusion Feed-forward Network for low-frequency enhancement. Besides, we introduce a special underwater semi-supervised training strategy, where we propose a Subaqueous Perceptual Loss function to generate reliable pseudo labels. Experiments using full-reference and non-reference underwater benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantity and visual quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio-visual zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen classes based on paired audio-visual sequences. Recent methods mainly focus on learning multi-modal features aligned with class names to enhance the generalization ability to unseen categories. However, these approaches ignore the obscure event concepts in class names and may inevitably introduce complex network structures with difficult training objectives. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet efficient framework called KnowleDge-Augmented audio-visual learning (KDA), which aids the model in more effectively learning novel event content by leveraging an external knowledge base. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the knowledge contained in large language models (LLMs) to generate numerous descriptive sentences that include important distinguishing audio-visual features of event classes, which helps to better understand unseen categories. Furthermore, we propose a knowledge-aware adaptive margin loss to help distinguish similar events, further improving the generalization ability towards unseen classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed KDA can outperform state-of-the-art methods on three popular audio-visual zero-shot learning datasets.Our code will be avaliable at \url{https://github.com/chenhaoxing/KDA}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Feng, Jing Lin, Sai Kumar Dwivedi, Yu Sun, Priyanka Patel, Michael J. Black</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ChatPose, a framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and reason about 3D human poses from images or textual descriptions. Our work is motivated by the human ability to intuitively understand postures from a single image or a brief description, a process that intertwines image interpretation, world knowledge, and an understanding of body language. Traditional human pose estimation and generation methods often operate in isolation, lacking semantic understanding and reasoning abilities. ChatPose addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as distinct signal tokens within a multimodal LLM, enabling the direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of multimodal LLMs, ChatPose unifies classical 3D human pose and generation tasks while offering user interactions. Additionally, ChatPose empowers LLMs to apply their extensive world knowledge in reasoning about human poses, leading to two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images. We establish benchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods. Our results show that ChatPose outperforms existing multimodal LLMs and task-specific methods on these newly proposed tasks. Furthermore, ChatPose's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based on complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human behavior anomaly detection aims to identify unusual human actions, playing a crucial role in intelligent surveillance and other areas. The current mainstream methods still adopt reconstruction or future frame prediction techniques. However, reconstructing or predicting low-level pixel features easily enables the network to achieve overly strong generalization ability, allowing anomalies to be reconstructed or predicted as effectively as normal data. Different from their methods, inspired by the Student-Teacher Network, we propose a novel framework called the Multilevel Guidance-Exploration Network(MGENet), which detects anomalies through the difference in high-level representation between the Guidance and Exploration network. Specifically, we first utilize the pre-trained Normalizing Flow that takes skeletal keypoints as input to guide an RGB encoder, which takes unmasked RGB frames as input, to explore motion latent features. Then, the RGB encoder guides the mask encoder, which takes masked RGB frames as input, to explore the latent appearance feature. Additionally, we design a Behavior-Scene Matching Module(BSMM) to detect scene-related behavioral anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShanghaiTech and UBnormal datasets, with AUC of 86.9 % and 73.5 %, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Chih Huang, Weijie Lyu, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent temporal LiDAR-based 3D object detectors achieve promising performance based on the two-stage proposal-based approach. They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lior Yariv, Omri Puny, Natalia Neverova, Oran Gafni, Yaron Lipman</p>
<p>Abstract: Current diffusion or flow-based generative models for 3D shapes divide to two: distilling pre-trained 2D image diffusion models, and training directly on 3D shapes. When training a diffusion or flow models on 3D shapes a crucial design choice is the shape representation. An effective shape representation needs to adhere three design principles: it should allow an efficient conversion of large 3D datasets to the representation form; it should provide a good tradeoff of approximation power versus number of parameters; and it should have a simple tensorial form that is compatible with existing powerful neural architectures. While standard 3D shape representations such as volumetric grids and point clouds do not adhere to all these principles simultaneously, we advocate in this paper a new representation that does. We introduce Mosaic-SDF (M-SDF): a simple 3D shape representation that approximates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of a given shape by using a set of local grids spread near the shape's boundary. The M-SDF representation is fast to compute for each shape individually making it readily parallelizable; it is parameter efficient as it only covers the space around the shape's boundary; and it has a simple matrix form, compatible with Transformer-based architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of the M-SDF representation by using it to train a 3D generative flow model including class-conditioned generation with the 3D Warehouse dataset, and text-to-3D generation using a dataset of about 600k caption-shape pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parham Zilouchian Moghaddam, Mehdi Modarressi, Mohammad Amin Sadeghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Video content has experienced a surge in popularity, asserting its dominance over internet traffic and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Video compression has long been regarded as the primary means of efficiently managing the substantial multimedia traffic generated by video-capturing devices. Nevertheless, video compression algorithms entail significant computational demands in order to achieve substantial compression ratios. This complexity presents a formidable challenge when implementing efficient video coding standards in resource-constrained embedded systems, such as IoT edge node cameras. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces NU-Class Net, an innovative deep-learning model designed to mitigate compression artifacts stemming from lossy compression codecs. This enhancement significantly elevates the perceptible quality of low-bit-rate videos. By employing the NU-Class Net, the video encoder within the video-capturing node can reduce output quality, thereby generating low-bit-rate videos and effectively curtailing both computation and bandwidth requirements at the edge. On the decoder side, which is typically less encumbered by resource limitations, NU-Class Net is applied after the video decoder to compensate for artifacts and approximate the quality of the original video. Experimental results affirm the efficacy of the proposed model in enhancing the perceptible quality of videos, especially those streamed at low bit rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitong Lu, Yile Wang, Julie D. Golomb</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in artificial intelligence, object recognition models still lag behind in emulating visual information processing in human brains. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often rely on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in understanding human visual perception. Addressing this gap, we present, for the first time, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnet represents a breakthrough in bridging the gap between artificial and human vision, and paving the way for more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aytekin Erdogan, Erdem Akag\"und\"uz</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the lack of a definitive ground truth for the image fusion problem, the loss functions are structured based on evaluation metrics, such as the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). However, in doing so, a bias is introduced toward the SSIM and, consequently, the input visual band image. The objective of this study is to propose a novel methodology for the image fusion problem that mitigates the limitations associated with using classical evaluation metrics as loss functions. Our approach integrates a transformer-based multi-scale fusion strategy that adeptly addresses local and global context information. This integration not only refines the individual components of the image fusion process but also significantly enhances the overall efficacy of the method. Our proposed method follows a two-stage training approach, where an auto-encoder is initially trained to extract deep features at multiple scales in the first stage. For the second stage, we integrate our fusion block and change the loss function as mentioned. The multi-scale features are fused using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. The CNNs are utilized to capture local features, while the Transformer handles the integration of general context features. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, our proposed method, along with the novel loss function definition, demonstrates superior performance compared to other competitive fusion algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G. Madhuri, Atul Negi</p>
<p>Abstract: Kernel-based nonlinear dictionary learning methods operate in a feature space obtained by an implicit feature map, and they are not independent of computationally expensive operations like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This paper presents an SVD-free lightweight approach to learning a nonlinear dictionary using a randomized functional link called a Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL). The proposed RVFL-based nonlinear Dictionary Learning (RVFLDL) learns a dictionary as a sparse-to-dense feature map from nonlinear sparse coefficients to the dense input features. Sparse coefficients w.r.t an initial random dictionary are derived by assuming Horseshoe prior are used as inputs making it a lightweight network. Training the RVFL-based dictionary is free from SVD computation as RVFL generates weights from the input to the output layer analytically. Higher-order dependencies between the input sparse coefficients and the dictionary atoms are incorporated into the training process by nonlinearly transforming the sparse coefficients and adding them as enhanced features. Thus the method projects sparse coefficients to a higher dimensional space while inducing nonlinearities into the dictionary. For classification using RVFL-net, a classifier matrix is learned as a transform that maps nonlinear sparse coefficients to the labels. The empirical evidence of the method illustrated in image classification and reconstruction applications shows that RVFLDL is scalable and provides a solution better than those obtained using other nonlinear dictionary learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Tse Chien, Rui-Yang Ju, Kuang-Yi Chou, Enkaer Xieerke, Jen-Shiun Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Wrist trauma and even fractures occur frequently in daily life, particularly among children who account for a significant proportion of fracture cases. Before performing surgery, surgeons often request patients to undergo X-ray imaging first and prepare for it based on the analysis of the radiologist. With the development of neural networks, You Only Look Once (YOLO) series models have been widely used in fracture detection as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD). In 2023, Ultralytics presented the latest version of the YOLO models, which has been employed for detecting fractures across various parts of the body. Attention mechanism is one of the hottest methods to improve the model performance. This research work proposes YOLOv8-AM, which incorporates the attention mechanism into the original YOLOv8 architecture. Specifically, we respectively employ four attention modules, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Global Attention Mechanism (GAM), Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), and Shuffle Attention (SA), to design the improved models and train them on GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean Average Precision at IoU 50 (mAP 50) of the YOLOv8-AM model based on ResBlock + CBAM (ResCBAM) increased from 63.6% to 65.8%, which achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Conversely, YOLOv8-AM model incorporating GAM obtains the mAP 50 value of 64.2%, which is not a satisfactory enhancement. Therefore, we combine ResBlock and GAM, introducing ResGAM to design another new YOLOv8-AM model, whose mAP 50 value is increased to 65.0%.

<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) in the top-view using fisheye cameras presents a promising and innovative application domain. However, the availability of datasets capturing this viewpoint is extremely limited, especially those with high-quality 2D and 3D keypoint annotations. Addressing this gap, we leverage the capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) technique to establish a comprehensive pipeline for generating human pose datasets from existing 2D and 3D datasets, specifically tailored for the top-view fisheye perspective. Through this pipeline, we create a novel dataset NToP570K (NeRF-powered Top-view human Pose dataset for fisheye cameras with over 570 thousand images), and conduct an extensive evaluation of its efficacy in enhancing neural networks for 2D and 3D top-view human pose estimation. A pretrained ViTPose-B model achieves an improvement in AP of 33.3 % on our validation set for 2D HPE after finetuning on our training set. A similarly finetuned HybrIK-Transformer model gains 53.7 mm reduction in PA-MPJPE for 3D HPE on the validation set.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective recognition of spatial patterns and learning their hierarchy is crucial in modern spatial data analysis. Volumetric data applications seek techniques ensuring invariance not only to shifts but also to pattern rotations. While traditional methods can readily achieve translational invariance, rotational invariance possesses multiple challenges and remains an active area of research. Here, we present ILPO-Net (Invariant to Local Patterns Orientation Network), a novel approach that handles arbitrarily shaped patterns with the convolutional operation inherently invariant to local spatial pattern orientations using the Wigner matrix expansions. Our architecture seamlessly integrates the new convolution operator and, when benchmarked on diverse volumetric datasets such as MedMNIST and CATH, demonstrates superior performance over the baselines with significantly reduced parameter counts - up to 1000 times fewer in the case of MedMNIST. Beyond these demonstrations, ILPO-Net's rotational invariance paves the way for other applications across multiple disciplines.

<p>Abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to parse a visual scene into an intermediate graph representation for downstream reasoning tasks. Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle to generate scene graphs with novel visual relation concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce a new open-vocabulary SGG framework based on sequence generation. Our framework leverages vision-language pre-trained models (VLM) by incorporating an image-to-graph generation paradigm. Specifically, we generate scene graph sequences via image-to-text generation with VLM and then construct scene graphs from these sequences. By doing so, we harness the strong capabilities of VLM for open-vocabulary SGG and seamlessly integrate explicit relational modeling for enhancing the VL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our design not only achieves superior performance with an open vocabulary but also enhances downstream vision-language task performance through explicit relation modeling knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for the reconstruction and denoising of point clouds rely on small datasets of 3D shapes. We circumvent the problem by leveraging deep learning methods trained on billions of images. We propose a method to reconstruct point clouds from few images and to denoise point clouds from their rendering by exploiting prior knowledge distilled from image-based deep learning models. To improve reconstruction in constraint settings, we regularize the training of a differentiable renderer with hybrid surface and appearance by introducing semantic consistency supervision. In addition, we propose a pipeline to finetune Stable Diffusion to denoise renderings of noisy point clouds and we demonstrate how these learned filters can be used to remove point cloud noise coming without 3D supervision. We compare our method with DSS and PointRadiance and achieved higher quality 3D reconstruction on the Sketchfab Testset and SCUT Dataset.</p>

As concise and robust representations of a scene, scene graphs have proven to be well-suited as the semantic control on the generated layout. We present a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) model to synthesize 3D scenes from scene graphs and floor plans. We exploit the properties of self-attention layers to capture high-level relationships between objects in a scene, and use these as the building blocks of our model. Our model, leverages graph transformers to estimate the size, dimension and orientation of the objects in a room while satisfying relationships in the given scene graph. Our experiments shows self-attention layers leads to sparser (7.9x compared to Graphto3D) and more diverse scenes (16%).</p>

<p>Abstract: With the success of large language models (LLMs), integrating the vision model into LLMs to build vision-language foundation models has gained much more interest recently. However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for short video understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficient and effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying to process more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose to process videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memory bank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-term analysis without exceeding LLMs' context length constraints or GPU memory limits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodal LLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video question answering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-art performances across multiple datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghoi Kim, Chen Jin, Tom Diethe, Matteo Figini, Henry F. J. Tregidgo, Asher Mullokandov, Philip Teare, Daniel C. Alexander</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in diffusion models have advanced conditioned image generation, yet they struggle with reconstructing out-of-distribution (OOD) images, such as unseen tumors in medical images, causing "image hallucination" and risking misdiagnosis. We hypothesize such hallucinations result from local OOD regions in the conditional images. We verify that partitioning the OOD region and conducting separate image generations alleviates hallucinations in several applications. From this, we propose a training-free diffusion framework that reduces hallucination with multiple Local Diffusion processes. Our approach involves OOD estimation followed by two modules: a "branching" module generates locally both within and outside OOD regions, and a "fusion" module integrates these predictions into one. Our evaluation shows our method mitigates hallucination over baseline models quantitatively and qualitatively, reducing misdiagnosis by 40% and 25% in the real-world medical and natural image datasets, respectively. It also demonstrates compatibility with various pre-trained diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Pajouheshgar, Yitao Xu, Sabine S\"usstrunk</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chirag Parikh, Rohit Saluja, C. V. Jawahar, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent vehicle systems require a deep understanding of the interplay between road conditions, surrounding entities, and the ego vehicle's driving behavior for safe and efficient navigation. This is particularly critical in developing countries where traffic situations are often dense and unstructured with heterogeneous road occupants. Existing datasets, predominantly geared towards structured and sparse traffic scenarios, fall short of capturing the complexity of driving in such environments. To fill this gap, we present IDD-X, a large-scale dual-view driving video dataset. With 697K bounding boxes, 9K important object tracks, and 1-12 objects per video, IDD-X offers comprehensive ego-relative annotations for multiple important road objects covering 10 categories and 19 explanation label categories. The dataset also incorporates rearview information to provide a more complete representation of the driving environment. We also introduce custom-designed deep networks aimed at multiple important object localization and per-object explanation prediction. Overall, our dataset and introduced prediction models form the foundation for studying how road conditions and surrounding entities affect driving behavior in complex traffic situations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Localizing text in low-light environments is challenging due to visual degradations. Although a straightforward solution involves a two-stage pipeline with low-light image enhancement (LLE) as the initial step followed by detector, LLE is primarily designed for human vision instead of machine and can accumulate errors. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective single-stage approach for localizing text in dark that circumvents the need for LLE. We introduce a constrained learning module as an auxiliary mechanism during the training stage of the text detector. This module is designed to guide the text detector in preserving textual spatial features amidst feature map resizing, thus minimizing the loss of spatial information in texts under low-light visual degradations. Specifically, we incorporate spatial reconstruction and spatial semantic constraints within this module to ensure the text detector acquires essential positional and contextual range knowledge. Our approach enhances the original text detector's ability to identify text's local topological features using a dynamic snake feature pyramid network and adopts a bottom-up contour shaping strategy with a novel rectangular accumulation technique for accurate delineation of streamlined text features. In addition, we present a comprehensive low-light dataset for arbitrary-shaped text, encompassing diverse scenes and languages. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this low-light dataset and exhibits comparable performance on standard normal light datasets. The code and dataset will be released.</p>

While the primary objective of automatic assessment tasks is to score movements, the automatic generation of feedback highlighting key movement issues has the potential to significantly enhance and accelerate the rehabilitation process. While numerous research works exist in the field of automatic movement assessment, only a handful address feedback generation. In this study, we explain the types of feedback that can be generated, review existing solutions for automatic feedback generation, and discuss future research directions.

<p>Abstract: When building classification systems with demographic fairness considerations, there are two objectives to satisfy: 1) maximizing utility for the specific task and 2) ensuring fairness w.r.t. a known demographic attribute. These objectives often compete, so optimizing both can lead to a trade-off between utility and fairness. While existing works acknowledge the trade-offs and study their limits, two questions remain unanswered: 1) What are the optimal trade-offs between utility and fairness? and 2) How can we numerically quantify these trade-offs from data for a desired prediction task and demographic attribute of interest? This paper addresses these questions. We introduce two utility-fairness trade-offs: the Data-Space and Label-Space Trade-off. The trade-offs reveal three regions within the utility-fairness plane, delineating what is fully and partially possible and impossible. We propose U-FaTE, a method to numerically quantify the trade-offs for a given prediction task and group fairness definition from data samples. Based on the trade-offs, we introduce a new scheme for evaluating representations. An extensive evaluation of fair representation learning methods and representations from over 1000 pre-trained models revealed that most current approaches are far from the estimated and achievable fairness-utility trade-offs across multiple datasets and prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shehan Perera, Pouyan Navard, Alper Yilmaz</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs) based architectures represents a significant advancement in 3D Medical Image (MI) segmentation, surpassing traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models by enhancing global contextual understanding. While this paradigm shift has significantly enhanced 3D segmentation performance, state-of-the-art architectures require extremely large and complex architectures with large scale computing resources for training and deployment. Furthermore, in the context of limited datasets, often encountered in medical imaging, larger models can present hurdles in both model generalization and convergence. In response to these challenges and to demonstrate that lightweight models are a valuable area of research in 3D medical imaging, we present SegFormer3D, a hierarchical Transformer that calculates attention across multiscale volumetric features. Additionally, SegFormer3D avoids complex decoders and uses an all-MLP decoder to aggregate local and global attention features to produce highly accurate segmentation masks. The proposed memory efficient Transformer preserves the performance characteristics of a significantly larger model in a compact design. SegFormer3D democratizes deep learning for 3D medical image segmentation by offering a model with 33x less parameters and a 13x reduction in GFLOPS compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA). We benchmark SegFormer3D against the current SOTA models on three widely used datasets Synapse, BRaTs, and ACDC, achieving competitive results. Code: https://github.com/OSUPCVLab/SegFormer3D.git</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nagabhushan Somraj, Kapil Choudhary, Sai Harsha Mupparaju, Rajiv Soundararajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing a 3D representation of a dynamic scene for fast optimization and rendering is a challenging task. While recent explicit representations enable fast learning and rendering of dynamic radiance fields, they require a dense set of input viewpoints. In this work, we focus on learning a fast representation for dynamic radiance fields with sparse input viewpoints. However, the optimization with sparse input is under-constrained and necessitates the use of motion priors to constrain the learning. Existing fast dynamic scene models do not explicitly model the motion, making them difficult to be constrained with motion priors. We design an explicit motion model as a factorized 4D representation that is fast and can exploit the spatio-temporal correlation of the motion field. We then introduce reliable flow priors including a combination of sparse flow priors across cameras and dense flow priors within cameras to regularize our motion model. Our model is fast, compact and achieves very good performance on popular multi-view dynamic scene datasets with sparse input viewpoints. The source code for our model can be found on our project page: https://nagabhushansn95.github.io/publications/2024/RF-DeRF.html.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Qiu, Hao Feng, Yuechen Wang, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable generalization capabilities via prompting, which leverages VLMs as knowledge bases to extract information beneficial for downstream tasks. However, existing methods primarily employ uni-modal prompting, which only engages a uni-modal branch, failing to simultaneously adjust vision-language (V-L) features. Additionally, the one-pass forward pipeline in VLM encoding struggles to align V-L features that have a huge gap. Confronting these challenges, we propose a novel method, Progressive Multi-modal conditional Prompt Tuning (ProMPT). ProMPT exploits a recurrent structure, optimizing and aligning V-L features by iteratively utilizing image and current encoding information. It comprises an initialization and a multi-modal iterative evolution (MIE) module. Initialization is responsible for encoding images and text using a VLM, followed by a feature filter that selects text features similar to image. MIE then facilitates multi-modal prompting through class-conditional vision prompting, instance-conditional text prompting, and feature filtering. In each MIE iteration, vision prompts are obtained from filtered text features via a vision generator, promoting image features to focus more on target object during vision prompting. The encoded image features are fed into a text generator to produce text prompts that are more robust to class shifts. Thus, V-L features are progressively aligned, enabling advance from coarse to exact prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted in three settings to evaluate the efficacy of ProMPT. The results indicate that ProMPT outperforms existing methods on average across all settings, demonstrating its superior generalization and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azad Singh, Vandan Gorade, Deepak Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising technique for medical image analysis due to its ability to learn without annotations. However, despite the promising potential, conventional SSL methods encounter limitations, including challenges in achieving semantic alignment and capturing subtle details. This leads to suboptimal representations, which fail to accurately capture the underlying anatomical structures and pathological details. In response to these constraints, we introduce a novel SSL framework OPTiML, employing optimal transport (OT), to capture the dense semantic invariance and fine-grained details, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of SSL in medical image representation learning. The core idea is to integrate OT with a cross-viewpoint semantics infusion module (CV-SIM), which effectively captures complex, fine-grained details inherent in medical images across different viewpoints. In addition to the CV-SIM module, OPTiML imposes the variance and covariance regularizations within OT framework to force the model focus on clinically relevant information while discarding less informative features. Through these, the proposed framework demonstrates its capacity to learn semantically rich representations that can be applied to various medical imaging tasks. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experimental studies on three publicly available datasets from chest X-ray modality. Our empirical results reveal OPTiML's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yian Li, Wentao Tian, Yang Jiao, Jingjing Chen, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, as a crucial manifestation of human intelligence, refers to making presuppositions based on established facts and extrapolating potential outcomes. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive cognitive and reasoning capabilities, which have been examined across a wide range of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. Nevertheless, how will existing MLLMs perform when faced with counterfactual questions? To answer this question, we first curate a novel \textbf{C}ounter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal reasoning benchmark, abbreviated as \textbf{CFMM}, to systematically assess the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Our CFMM comprises six challenging tasks, each including hundreds of carefully human-labeled counterfactual questions, to evaluate MLLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities across diverse aspects. Through experiments, interestingly, we find that existing MLLMs prefer to believe what they see, but ignore the counterfactual presuppositions presented in the question, thereby leading to inaccurate responses. Furthermore, we evaluate a wide range of prevalent MLLMs on our proposed CFMM. The significant gap between their performance on our CFMM and that on several VQA benchmarks indicates that there is still considerable room for improvement in existing MLLMs toward approaching human-level intelligence. On the other hand, through boosting MLLMs performances on our CFMM in the future, potential avenues toward developing MLLMs with advanced intelligence can be explored.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Ding, Panfeng Li, Qikai Yang, Siyang Li, Qingtian Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel contribution to the field of regional style transfer. Existing methods often suffer from the drawback of applying style homogeneously across the entire image, leading to stylistic inconsistencies or foreground object twisted when applied to image with foreground elements such as person figures. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach that leverages a segmentation network to precisely isolate foreground objects within the input image. Subsequently, style transfer is applied exclusively to the background region. The isolated foreground objects are then carefully reintegrated into the style-transferred background. To enhance the visual coherence between foreground and background, a color transfer step is employed on the foreground elements prior to their rein-corporation. Finally, we utilize feathering techniques to achieve a seamless amalgamation of foreground and background, resulting in a visually unified and aesthetically pleasing final composition. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach yields significantly more natural stylistic transformations compared to conventional methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Li, Ruitong Gan, Chuanchen Luo, Yuxi Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Ziwei Zhu Man Zhang, Qing Li, Xucheng Yin, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Junran Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Driven by powerful image diffusion models, recent research has achieved the automatic creation of 3D objects from textual or visual guidance. By performing score distillation sampling (SDS) iteratively across different views, these methods succeed in lifting 2D generative prior to the 3D space. However, such a 2D generative image prior bakes the effect of illumination and shadow into the texture. As a result, material maps optimized by SDS inevitably involve spurious correlated components. The absence of precise material definition makes it infeasible to relight the generated assets reasonably in novel scenes, which limits their application in downstream scenarios. In contrast, humans can effortlessly circumvent this ambiguity by deducing the material of the object from its appearance and semantics. Motivated by this insight, we propose MaterialSeg3D, a 3D asset material generation framework to infer underlying material from the 2D semantic prior. Based on such a prior model, we devise a mechanism to parse material in 3D space. We maintain a UV stack, each map of which is unprojected from a specific viewpoint. After traversing all viewpoints, we fuse the stack through a weighted voting scheme and then employ region unification to ensure the coherence of the object parts. To fuel the learning of semantics prior, we collect a material dataset, named Materialized Individual Objects (MIO), which features abundant images, diverse categories, and accurate annotations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Kee, Adam Pikielny, Kevin Blackburn-Matzen, Marc Levoy</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe a system to remove real-world reflections from images for consumer photography. Our system operates on linear (RAW) photos, with the (optional) addition of a contextual photo looking in the opposite direction, e.g., using the selfie camera on a mobile device, which helps disambiguate what should be considered the reflection. The system is trained using synthetic mixtures of real-world RAW images, which are combined using a reflection simulation that is photometrically and geometrically accurate. Our system consists of a base model that accepts the captured photo and optional contextual photo as input, and runs at 256p, followed by an up-sampling model that transforms output 256p images to full resolution. The system can produce images for review at 1K in 4.5 to 6.5 seconds on a MacBook or iPhone 14 Pro. We test on RAW photos that were captured in the field and embody typical consumer photographs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Yang, Lu Wen, Yuanyuan Xu, Jiliu Zhou, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal Multi-source Domain Adaptation (UniMDA) transfers knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain under domain shifts (different data distribution) and class shifts (unknown target classes). Existing solutions focus on excavating image features to detect unknown samples, ignoring abundant information contained in textual semantics. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Prompt learning with Negative textual semantics and uncErtainty modeling method based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (APNE-CLIP) for UniMDA classification tasks. Concretely, we utilize the CLIP with adaptive prompts to leverage textual information of class semantics and domain representations, helping the model identify unknown samples and address domain shifts. Additionally, we design a novel global instance-level alignment objective by utilizing negative textual semantics to achieve more precise image-text pair alignment. Furthermore, we propose an energy-based uncertainty modeling strategy to enlarge the margin distance between known and unknown samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brice Ozenne, Martin Norgaard, Cyril Pernet, Melanie Ganz</p>
<p>Abstract: Even though novel imaging techniques have been successful in studying brain structure and function, the measured biological signals are often contaminated by multiple sources of noise, arising due to e.g. head movements of the individual being scanned, limited spatial/temporal resolution, or other issues specific to each imaging technology. Data preprocessing (e.g. denoising) is therefore critical. Preprocessing pipelines have become increasingly complex over the years, but also more flexible, and this flexibility can have a significant impact on the final results and conclusions of a given study. This large parameter space is often referred to as multiverse analyses. Here, we provide conceptual and practical tools for statistical analyses that can aggregate multiple pipeline results along with a new sensitivity analysis testing for hypotheses across pipelines such as "no effect across all pipelines" or "at least one pipeline with no effect". The proposed framework is generic and can be applied to any multiverse scenario, but we illustrate its use based on positron emission tomography data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongsheng Yue, Hongwei Yong, Qian Zhao, Lei Zhang, Deyu Meng, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind image restoration (IR) is a common yet challenging problem in computer vision. Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyue Ding, Kunchi Li, Jun Wan, Shan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Rehearsal approaches in class incremental learning (CIL) suffer from decision boundary overfitting to new classes, which is mainly caused by two factors: insufficiency of old classes data for knowledge distillation and imbalanced data learning between the learned and new classes because of the limited storage memory. In this work, we present a simple but effective approach to tackle these two factors. First, we employ a re-sampling strategy and Mixup K}nowledge D}istillation (Re-MKD) to improve the performances of KD, which would greatly alleviate the overfitting problem. Specifically, we combine mixup and re-sampling strategies to synthesize adequate data used in KD training that are more consistent with the latent distribution between the learned and new classes. Second, we propose a novel incremental influence balance (IIB) method for CIL to tackle the classification of imbalanced data by extending the influence balance method into the CIL setting, which re-weights samples by their influences to create a proper decision boundary. With these two improvements, we present the effective decision boundary learning algorithm (EDBL) which improves the performance of KD and deals with the imbalanced data learning simultaneously. Experiments show that the proposed EDBL achieves state-of-the-art performances on several CIL benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern medical records include a vast amount of multimodal free text clinical data and imaging data from radiology, cardiology, and digital pathology. Fully mining such big data requires multitasking; otherwise, occult but important aspects may be overlooked, adversely affecting clinical management and population healthcare. Despite remarkable successes of AI in individual tasks with single-modal data, the progress in developing generalist medical AI remains relatively slow to combine multimodal data for multitasks because of the dual challenges of data curation and model architecture. The data challenge involves querying and curating multimodal structured and unstructured text, alphanumeric, and especially 3D tomographic scans on an individual patient level for real-time decisions and on a scale to estimate population health statistics. The model challenge demands a scalable and adaptable network architecture to integrate multimodal datasets for diverse clinical tasks. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) with application in lung cancer screening and related tasks. After we curated a comprehensive multimodal multitask dataset consisting of 49 clinical data types including 163,725 chest CT series and 17 medical tasks involved in LCS, we develop a multimodal question-answering framework as a unified training and inference strategy to synergize multimodal information and perform multiple tasks via free-text prompting. M3FM consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art single-modal task-specific models, identifies multimodal data elements informative for clinical tasks and flexibly adapts to new tasks with a small out-of-distribution dataset. As a specialty-oriented generalist medical AI model, M3FM paves the way for similar breakthroughs in other areas of medicine, closing the gap between specialists and the generalist.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a widely used driver assistance technology for maintaining the desired speed and safe distance to the leading vehicle. This paper evaluates the security of the deep neural network (DNN) based ACC systems under runtime stealthy perception attacks that strategically inject perturbations into camera data to cause forward collisions. We present a context-aware strategy for the selection of the most critical times for triggering the attacks and a novel optimization-based method for the adaptive generation of image perturbations at runtime. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attack using an actual vehicle, a publicly available driving dataset, and a realistic simulation platform with the control software from a production ACC system, a physical-world driving simulator, and interventions by the human driver and safety features such as Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS). Experimental results show that the proposed attack achieves 142.9 times higher success rate in causing hazards and 89.6% higher evasion rate than baselines, while being stealthy and robust to real-world factors and dynamic changes in the environment. This study highlights the role of human drivers and basic safety mechanisms in preventing attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate estimation of Room Impulse Response (RIR), which captures an environment's acoustic properties, is important for speech processing and AR/VR applications. We propose AV-RIR, a novel multi-modal multi-task learning approach to accurately estimate the RIR from a given reverberant speech signal and the visual cues of its corresponding environment. AV-RIR builds on a novel neural codec-based architecture that effectively captures environment geometry and materials properties and solves speech dereverberation as an auxiliary task by using multi-task learning. We also propose Geo-Mat features that augment material information into visual cues and CRIP that improves late reverberation components in the estimated RIR via image-to-RIR retrieval by 86%. Empirical results show that AV-RIR quantitatively outperforms previous audio-only and visual-only approaches by achieving 36% - 63% improvement across various acoustic metrics in RIR estimation. Additionally, it also achieves higher preference scores in human evaluation. As an auxiliary benefit, dereverbed speech from AV-RIR shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art in various spoken language processing tasks and outperforms reverberation time error score in the real-world AVSpeech dataset.

To address this challenge, we present KDAS, a Knowledge Distillation framework that incorporates attention supervision, and our proposed Symmetrical Guiding Module.

Through extensive experiments, our compact models demonstrate their strength by achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising approach to creating compact models with high accuracy for polyp segmentation and in the medical imaging field.

And this is not suitable for the medical field, especially for mobile medical devices, where computationally loaded models are not suitable for real clinical environments due to computational resource constraints. Recently, state-space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have become a strong competitor to traditional CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we deeply explore the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba and propose an UltraLight Vision Mamba UNet (UltraLight VM-UNet) based on this. Specifically, we propose a method for processing features in parallel Vision Mamba, named PVM Layer, which achieves excellent performance with the lowest computational load while keeping the overall number of processing channels constant. We conducted comparisons and ablation experiments with several state-of-the-art lightweight models on three skin lesion public datasets and demonstrated that the UltraLight VM-UNet exhibits the same strong performance competitiveness with parameters of only 0.049M and GFLOPs of 0.060. In addition, this study deeply explores the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba, which will lay a theoretical foundation for Mamba to possibly become a new mainstream module for lightweighting in the future.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuan Huang, Jia Wei, Rui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal brain images from MRI scans are widely used in clinical diagnosis to provide complementary information from different modalities. However, obtaining fully paired multi-modal images in practice is challenging due to various factors, such as time, cost, and artifacts, resulting in modality-missing brain images. To address this problem, unsupervised multi-modal brain image translation has been extensively studied. Existing methods suffer from the problem of brain tumor deformation during translation, as they fail to focus on the tumor areas when translating the whole images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised tumor-aware distillation teacher-student network called UTAD-Net, which is capable of perceiving and translating tumor areas precisely. Specifically, our model consists of two parts: a teacher network and a student network. The teacher network learns an end-to-end mapping from source to target modality using unpaired images and corresponding tumor masks first. Then, the translation knowledge is distilled into the student network, enabling it to generate more realistic tumor areas and whole images without masks. Experiments show that our model achieves competitive performance on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image quality compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated images on downstream segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/scut-HC/UTAD-Net.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Yang, Yujia Liu, Dingquan Li, Yan Zhong, Tingting Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated impressive success in No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). However, recent researches highlight the vulnerability of NR-IQA models to subtle adversarial perturbations, leading to inconsistencies between model predictions and subjective ratings. Current adversarial attacks, however, focus on perturbing predicted scores of individual images, neglecting the crucial aspect of inter-score correlation relationships within an entire image set. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the correlation, like ranking correlation, plays a significant role in NR-IQA tasks. To comprehensively explore the robustness of NR-IQA models, we introduce a new framework of correlation-error-based attacks that perturb both the correlation within an image set and score changes on individual images. Our research primarily focuses on ranking-related correlation metrics like Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) and prediction error-related metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). As an instantiation, we propose a practical two-stage SROCC-MSE-Attack (SMA) that initially optimizes target attack scores for the entire image set and then generates adversarial examples guided by these scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our SMA method not only significantly disrupts the SROCC to negative values but also maintains a considerable change in the scores of individual images. Meanwhile, it exhibits state-of-the-art performance across metrics with different categories. Our method provides a new perspective on the robustness of NR-IQA models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Genggeng Chen, Kexin Dai, Kangzhen Yang, Tao Hu, Xiangyu Chen, Yongqing Yang, Wei Dong, Peng Wu, Yanning Zhang, Qingsen Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, due to a series of image degradations, obtaining high-quality, clear content photos is challenging. While significant progress has been made in synthesizing high-quality images, previous methods for image restoration and enhancement often overlooked the characteristics of different degradations. They applied the same structure to address various types of degradation, resulting in less-than-ideal restoration outcomes. Inspired by the notion that high/low frequency information is applicable to different degradations, we introduce HLNet, a Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement method based on high-low frequency decomposition. Specifically, we employ two modules for feature extraction: shared weight modules and non-shared weight modules. In the shared weight modules, we use SCConv to extract common features from different degradations. In the non-shared weight modules, we introduce the High-Low Frequency Decomposition Block (HLFDB), which employs different methods to handle high-low frequency information, enabling the model to address different degradations more effectively. Compared to other networks, our method takes into account the characteristics of different degradations, thus achieving higher-quality image restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxuan Li, Ryota Hinami, Kiyoharu Aizawa, Yusuke Matsui</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing characters and predicting speakers of dialogue are critical for comic processing tasks, such as voice generation or translation. However, because characters vary by comic title, supervised learning approaches like training character classifiers which require specific annotations for each comic title are infeasible. This motivates us to propose a novel zero-shot approach, allowing machines to identify characters and predict speaker names based solely on unannotated comic images. In spite of their importance in real-world applications, these task have largely remained unexplored due to challenges in story comprehension and multimodal integration. Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown great capability for text understanding and reasoning, while their application to multimodal content analysis is still an open problem. To address this problem, we propose an iterative multimodal framework, the first to employ multimodal information for both character identification and speaker prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, establishing a robust baseline for these tasks. Furthermore, since our method requires no training data or annotations, it can be used as-is on any comic series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Zhang, Yifeng Wang, Zijie Fang, Hao Bian, Linghan Cai, Ziyue Wang, Yongbing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised segmentation methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to reduce the reliance on costly pixel-level annotations during model training. However, the current weakly supervised nuclei segmentation approaches typically follow a two-stage pseudo-label generation and network training process. The performance of the nuclei segmentation heavily relies on the quality of the generated pseudo-labels, thereby limiting its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel domain-adaptive weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework using cross-task interaction strategies to overcome the challenge of pseudo-label generation. Specifically, we utilize weakly annotated data to train an auxiliary detection task, which assists the domain adaptation of the segmentation network. To enhance the efficiency of domain adaptation, we design a consistent feature constraint module integrating prior knowledge from the source domain. Furthermore, we develop pseudo-label optimization and interactive training methods to improve the domain transfer capability. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive comparative and ablation experiments on six datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing weakly supervised approaches. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable or even better performance than fully supervised methods. Our code will be released in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/DAWN.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15256">TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junli Ren, Yikai Liu, Yingru Dai, Guijin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present and integrate a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we not only implement a locomotion controller to track the navigation commands, but also construct a proprioception advisor to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we make online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</p>
