<p><b>Authors:</b> Alana Renda, Jillian Ross, Michael Cafarella, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident. Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mira\c{c} Bu\u{g}ra \"Ozkan</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic, replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects (flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcus A. Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations, definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed. We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct them.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable, reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale, longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy, sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles, employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32 extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available, enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling, emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15236">From Checklists to Clusters: A Homeostatic Account of AGI Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brett Reynolds</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without architectural access.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15258">Multi-dimensional Data Analysis and Applications Basing on LLM Agents and Knowledge Graph Interactions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Xianyao Ling, Kun Li, Gang Yin, Liang Zhang, Jiang Wu, Jun Xu, Fu Zhang, Wenbo Lei, Annie Wang, Peng Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive, heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination" issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15259">Experience-Driven Exploration for Efficient API-Free AI Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenwei Tang, Jingyu Xing, Xinyu Liu, Zizhou Wang, Jiawei Du, Liangli Zhen, Jiancheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences, they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex, open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jitesh Jain, Shubham Maheshwari, Ning Yu, Wen-mei Hwu, Humphrey Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals. Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i) encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and (iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases, we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuang-Da Wang, Zhao Wang, Yotaro Shimose, Wei-Yao Wang, Shingo Takamatsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata, localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingqiao Xu, Ziru Zeng, Jiayu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers, providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus, we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezhong Tan, Hang Gao, Xinhong Ma, Feng Zhang, Ziqiang Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Basso, Luca Bortolussi, Mirjana Videnovic-Misic, Husni Habal</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints, along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards. When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment, the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6% reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15395">Corrigibility Transformation: Constructing Goals That Accept Updates</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rubi Hudson</p>
<p>Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However, partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them. We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training, corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible, without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huining Yuan, Zelai Xu, Zheyue Tan, Xiangmin Yi, Mo Guang, Kaiwen Long, Haojia Hui, Boxun Li, Xinlei Chen, Bo Zhao, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Chao Yu, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7% performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of 10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyin Liu, Zhuo Zhang, Sen Huang, Lipeng Xie, Qingxu Fu, Haoran Chen, LI YU, Tianyi Hu, Zhaoyang Liu, Bolin Ding, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and now manageable dimension of AI feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Usman Ali, Ali Zia, Waqas Ali, Umer Ramzan, Abdul Rehman, Muhammad Tayyab Chaudhry, Wei Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayuan Bai, Xuan-guang Pan, Chongyang Tao, Shuai Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool. Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$ decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards, enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale generalization and robustness to generator capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lavanya Umapathy, Patricia M Johnson, Tarun Dutt, Angela Tong, Madhur Nayan, Hersh Chandarana, Daniel K Sodickson</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931 blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Sun, Yankai Jiang, Zhenyu Tang, Yaning Pan, Shuang Gu, Zekai Lin, Lilong Wang, Wenjie Lou, Lei Liu, Lei Bai, Xiaosong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise, logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs) often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ed Li, Junyu Ren, Xintian Pan, Cat Yan, Chuanhao Li, Dirk Bergemann, Zhuoran Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context management that hinders long-horizon research. We present \texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring \textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a \coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization -- users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including \textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication} to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research -- from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keertana Chidambaram, Karthik Vinary Seetharaman, Vasilis Syrgkanis</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations: the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.</p>

To ensure the reliability of the extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Satta Chiris (University of Exeter, United Kingdom), Ayush Mishra (University of Exeter, United Kingdom)</p>
<p>Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score, evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents, synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H) communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minlin Zeng, Zhipeng Zhou, Yang Qiu, Zhiqi Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years, particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques. Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources. However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive, web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on user perception</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard M. Bailey</p>
<p>Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example, fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools, LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The `dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.</p>

A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingrui Wang, Wufei Ma, Tiezheng Zhang, Celso M de Melo, Jieneng Chen, Alan Yuille</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.

<p>Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of the art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The experimental results calculated over benchmarks functions of CEC2022 demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up achieved in case of proposed parallel version. We also use two real world applications (1) Tension/Compression Spring Design in engineering optimization and (2) Image Thresholding using otsu method for testing the performance of proposed implementation in handling real tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose DeepAries , a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic portfolio management that jointly optimizes the timing and allocation of rebalancing decisions. Unlike prior reinforcement learning methods that employ fixed rebalancing intervals regardless of market conditions, DeepAries adaptively selects optimal rebalancing intervals along with portfolio weights to reduce unnecessary transaction costs and maximize risk-adjusted returns. Our framework integrates a Transformer-based state encoder, which effectively captures complex long-term market dependencies, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to generate simultaneous discrete (rebalancing intervals) and continuous (asset allocations) actions. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world financial markets demonstrate that DeepAries significantly outperforms traditional fixed-frequency and full-rebalancing strategies in terms of risk-adjusted returns, transaction costs, and drawdowns. Additionally, we provide a live demo of DeepAries at https://deep-aries.github.io/, along with the source code and dataset at https://github.com/dmis-lab/DeepAries, illustrating DeepAries' capability to produce interpretable rebalancing and allocation decisions aligned with shifting market regimes. Overall, DeepAries introduces an innovative paradigm for adaptive and practical portfolio management by integrating both timing and allocation into a unified decision-making process.</p>

Standard portfolio optimization methods, typically built on stationarity or regime-agnostic assumptions, struggle to adapt to such changes. To address these challenges, we propose RegimeFolio, a novel regime-aware and sector-specialized framework that, unlike existing regime-agnostic models such as DeepVol and DRL optimizers, integrates explicit volatility regime segmentation with sector-specific ensemble forecasting and adaptive mean-variance allocation. This modular architecture ensures forecasts and portfolio decisions remain aligned with current market conditions, enhancing robustness and interpretability in dynamic markets. RegimeFolio combines three components: (i) an interpretable VIX-based classifier for market regime detection; (ii) regime and sector-specific ensemble learners (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to capture conditional return structures; and (iii) a dynamic mean-variance optimizer with shrinkage-regularized covariance estimates for regime-aware allocation. We evaluate RegimeFolio on 34 large cap U.S. equities from 2020 to 2024. The framework achieves a cumulative return of 137 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.17, a 12 percent lower maximum drawdown, and a 15 to 20 percent improvement in forecast accuracy compared to conventional and advanced machine learning benchmarks. These results show that explicitly modeling volatility regimes in predictive learning and portfolio allocation enhances robustness and leads to more dependable decision-making in real markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob K. Christopher, Austin Seamann, Jingyi Cui, Sagar Khare, Ferdinando Fioretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models offer a powerful means of capturing the manifold of realistic protein structures, enabling rapid design for protein engineering tasks. However, existing approaches observe critical failure modes when precise constraints are necessary for functional design. To this end, we present a constrained diffusion framework for structure-guided protein design, ensuring strict adherence to functional requirements while maintaining precise stereochemical and geometric feasibility. The approach integrates proximal feasibility updates with ADMM decomposition into the generative process, scaling effectively to the complex constraint sets of this domain. We evaluate on challenging protein design tasks, including motif scaffolding and vacancy-constrained pocket design, while introducing a novel curated benchmark dataset for motif scaffolding in the PDZ domain. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art, providing perfect satisfaction of bonding and geometric constraints with no degradation in structural diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cade Houston Kennedy, Amr Hilal, Morteza Momeni</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growth of digital financial systems, robust security and privacy have become a concern for financial institutions. Even though traditional machine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they often compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive information. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems that regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across institutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration among banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This survey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a novel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance exposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio optimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike prior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems, discussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention and blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not without challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory compliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current defense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain integration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and quantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for researchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant financial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leela Krishna, Mengyang Zhao, Saicharithreddy Pasula, Harshit Rajgarhia, Abhishek Mukherji</p>
<p>Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription, PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii) consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata, our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without sacrificing throughput or governance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to integrate physical information effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Ibad Hasnain</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease are major complications of diabetes, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Early detection of these conditions is critical, yet traditional diagnostic markers often lack sensitivity in the initial stages. This study integrates conventional statistical methods with machine learning approaches to improve early diagnosis of CKD and CVD in diabetic patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed in SPSS to explore associations between diseases and clinical or demographic factors. Patients were categorized into four groups: Group A both CKD and CVD, Group B CKD only, Group C CVD only, and Group D no disease. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations: Serum Creatinine and Hypertension with CKD, and Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Hypertension with CVD. These results guided the selection of predictive features for machine learning models. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest algorithms were implemented, with Random Forest showing the highest accuracy, particularly for CKD prediction. Ensemble models outperformed single classifiers in identifying high-risk diabetic patients. SPSS results further validated the significance of the key parameters integrated into the models. While challenges such as interpretability and class imbalance remain, this hybrid statistical machine learning framework offers a promising advancement toward early detection and risk stratification of diabetic complications compared to conventional diagnostic approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiming Zhang, Qingfu Zhu, Xianzhen Luo, Yixuan Wang, Bohan Li, Wanxiang Che</p>
<p>Abstract: Code translation aims to translate the code from its source language to the target language and is used in various software development scenarios. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities in code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training models for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into program-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has complete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not provide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length, while the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due to limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods for code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to generate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we explore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently enhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data. Experiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined with the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the baseline, achieving a maximum gain of 3.78% on pass@k.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allen Daniel Sunny</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that explain variation in these angles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Kou, Junyang Chen, Xin-Qiang Cai, Ming-Kun Xie, Biao Liu, Changwei Wang, Lei Feng, Yuheng Jia, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts. This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL}, \textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision. In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method. Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enis O\u{g}uz</p>
<p>Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks alone in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rekha R Nair, Tina Babu, Alavikunhu Panthakkan, Balamurugan Balusamy, Wathiq Mansoor</p>
<p>Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector, where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions, followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in large-scale wind energy deployments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit the Universal Approximation Theorem(UAT) through the lens of the tropical geometry of neural networks and introduce a constructive, geometry-aware initialization for sigmoidal multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Tropical geometry shows that Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks admit decision functions with a combinatorial structure often described as a tropical rational, namely a difference of tropical polynomials. Focusing on planar binary classification, we design purely sigmoidal MLPs that adhere to the finite-sum format of UAT: a finite linear combination of shifted and scaled sigmoids of affine functions. The resulting models yield decision boundaries that already align with prescribed shapes at initialization and can be refined by standard training if desired. This provides a practical bridge between the tropical perspective and smooth MLPs, enabling interpretable, shape-driven initialization without resorting to ReLU architectures. We focus on the construction and empirical demonstrations in two dimensions; theoretical analysis and higher-dimensional extensions are left for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mor Ventura, Michael Toker, Or Patashnik, Yonatan Belinkov, Roi Reichart</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, where adversaries iteratively elicit harmful behaviors that bypass single-turn safety filters. Existing defenses predominantly rely on passive rejection, which either fails against adaptive attackers or overly restricts benign users. We propose a honeypot-based proactive guardrail system that transforms risk avoidance into risk utilization. Our framework fine-tunes a bait model to generate ambiguous, non-actionable but semantically relevant responses, which serve as lures to probe user intent. Combined with the protected LLM's safe reply, the system inserts proactive bait questions that gradually expose malicious intent through multi-turn interactions. We further introduce the Honeypot Utility Score (HUS), measuring both the attractiveness and feasibility of bait responses, and use a Defense Efficacy Rate (DER) for balancing safety and usability. Initial experiment on MHJ Datasets with recent attack method across GPT-4o show that our system significantly disrupts jailbreak success while preserving benign user experience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably, although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss, cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of \emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks exploiting cross-modal vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing significant gaps in existing protections.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective and efficient access to relevant information is essential for disaster management. However, no retrieval model is specialized for disaster management, and existing general-domain models fail to handle the varied search intents inherent to disaster management scenarios, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable performance. To this end, we introduce DMRetriever, the first series of dense retrieval models (33M to 7.6B) tailored for this domain. It is trained through a novel three-stage framework of bidirectional attention adaptation, unsupervised contrastive pre-training, and difficulty-aware progressive instruction fine-tuning, using high-quality data generated through an advanced data refinement pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DMRetriever achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all six search intents at every model scale. Moreover, DMRetriever is highly parameter-efficient, with 596M model outperforming baselines over 13.3 X larger and 33M model exceeding baselines with only 7.6% of their parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanchang Fu, Qiyue Yin, Shengda Liu, Pei Xu, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand abstraction is crucial for scaling imperfect-information games (IIGs) such as Texas Hold'em, yet progress is limited by the lack of a formal task model and by evaluations that require resource-intensive strategy solving. We introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction. Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality. Experiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently outperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a unified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for designing higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long, physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative, enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to attention-based or convolutional regressors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessy Lin, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Ghosh, Wen-Tau Yih, Aram Markosyan, Vincent-Pierre Berges, Barlas O\u{g}uz</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual learning in large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utku Demir, Tugba Erpek, Yalin E. Sagduyu, Sastry Kompella, Mengran Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: In emerging networked systems, mobile edge devices such as ground vehicles and unmanned aerial system (UAS) swarms collectively aggregate vast amounts of data to make machine learning decisions such as threat detection in remote, dynamic, and infrastructure-constrained environments where power and bandwidth are scarce. Federated learning (FL) addresses these constraints and privacy concerns by enabling nodes to share local model weights for deep neural networks instead of raw data, facilitating more reliable decision-making than individual learning. However, conventional FL relies on a central server to coordinate model updates in each learning round, which imposes significant computational burdens on the central node and may not be feasible due to the connectivity constraints. By eliminating dependence on a central server, distributed federated learning (DFL) offers scalability, resilience to node failures, learning robustness, and more effective defense strategies. Despite these advantages, DFL remains vulnerable to increasingly advanced and stealthy cyberattacks. In this paper, we design sophisticated targeted training data poisoning and backdoor (Trojan) attacks, and characterize the emerging vulnerabilities in a vehicular network. We analyze how DFL provides resilience against such attacks compared to individual learning and present effective defense mechanisms to further strengthen DFL against the emerging cyber threats.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over 70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for scenarios where RL training data is scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Brady, Tunazzina Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse, but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs, abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral underpinnings of digital political communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However, generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers. Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than 60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Wu, Xianrui Zhong, Jiashuo Sun, Bolian Li, Bowen Jin, Jiawei Han, Qingkai Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density and contextual clarity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fasheng Xu, Xiaoyu Wang, Wei Chen, Karen Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The strategic choice of model "openness" has become a defining issue for the foundation model (FM) ecosystem. While this choice is intensely debated, its underlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period game-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value chain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant developer. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to the entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a "data flywheel effect," whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the deployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's optimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of the data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very strong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an intermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's learning. This dynamic gives rise to an "openness trap," a critical policy paradox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic flexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to show that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical integration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel effect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient competitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be captured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness adjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the developer's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we provide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective policy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Amin Nabian, Sudeep Chavare, Deepak Akhare, Rishikesh Ranade, Ram Cherukuri, Srinivas Tadepalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchan Kwon, Shang Zhu, Federico Bianchi, Kaitlyn Zhou, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence: the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions. Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning (RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to 0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement, achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amitesh Badkul, Lei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity (PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous, chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD) splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity (lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage (SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lina Berrayana, Ahmed Heakl, Muhammad Abdullah Sohail, Thomas Hofmann, Salman Khan, Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However, popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently, prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this, DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points. Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift. Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment under real-world uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Fan, Yifeng Liu, Qingyue Zhao, Angela Yuan, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent, degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically, the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as $\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as $\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields \emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance. Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding. TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS, Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations, bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate, scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Liu, Jindong Han, Tengfei Lyu, Weijia Zhang, Zhe-Rui Yang, Lu Dai, Cancheng Liu, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1) Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3) Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention. Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery.

<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However, most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions, enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging. Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions, yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingao Xu, Shuoyoucheng Ma, Xin Song, Rong Jiang, Hongkui Tu, Bin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph (KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianyang Qi, Yuan Tian, Zhaoyu Hu, Zhirui Kuai, Chang Liu, Hongxiang Lin, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial recommender systems critically depend on high-quality ranking models. However, traditional pipelines still rely on manual feature engineering and scenario-specific architectures, which hinder cross-scenario transfer and large-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with Multi-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt integrates two key components. The \textbf{AutoToken} module automatically clusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the need for human-defined feature groups. The \textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module enables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense experts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and scenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on the industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models, WuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales, MTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields further monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world impact: in the \textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by \textbf{+3.62\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \textbf{+2.54\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous features across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and commercial outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Belli, Kate Bentley, Will Alexander, Emily Ward, Matt Hawrilenko, Kelly Johnston, Mill Brown, Adam Chekroud</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minglei Shi, Haolin Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Ziyang Yuan, Xiaoshi Wu, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Qiao, Xing Liu, Wenke Huang, Jianbin Li, Zhaoxin Fan, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.</p>

On a real testbed with H100 GPUs, beLLMan helps keep inferencing latency under control (upto 8X lower end-to-end latency) and reduces energy consumption by 25% (while serving 19% more requests) during periods of congestion for a summarization workload.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gahee Kim, Takamitsu Matsubara</p>
<p>Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain, which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation, with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and gravel, with a bucket pouring action.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments, finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced, model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more promising direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heecheol Yun, Kwangmin Ki, Junghyun Lee, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers, its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability, we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500 and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dechen Zhang, Zhenmei Shi, Yi Zhang, Yingyu Liang, Difan Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a foundational tool in machine learning, with recent work emphasizing its connections to neural networks. However, existing theory primarily addresses the i.i.d. setting, while real-world data often exhibits structured dependencies - particularly in applications like denoising score learning where multiple noisy observations derive from shared underlying signals. We present the first systematic study of KRR generalization for non-i.i.d. data with signal-noise causal structure, where observations represent different noisy views of common signals. By developing a novel blockwise decomposition method that enables precise concentration analysis for dependent data, we derive excess risk bounds for KRR that explicitly depend on: (1) the kernel spectrum, (2) causal structure parameters, and (3) sampling mechanisms (including relative sample sizes for signals and noises). We further apply our results to denoising score learning, establishing generalization guarantees and providing principled guidance for sampling noisy data points. This work advances KRR theory while providing practical tools for analyzing dependent data in modern machine learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of both EEG and ECoG signals.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods.

<p>Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, are increasingly used in search and rescue missions to detect human presence. Existing systems primarily leverage vision-based methods which are prone to fail under low-visibility or occlusion. Drone-based audio perception offers promise but suffers from extreme ego-noise that masks sounds indicating human presence. Existing datasets are either limited in diversity or synthetic, lacking real acoustic interactions, and there are no standardized setups for drone audition. To this end, we present DroneAudioset (The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ahlab-drone-project/DroneAudioSet/ under the MIT license), a comprehensive drone audition dataset featuring 23.5 hours of annotated recordings, covering a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -57.2 dB to -2.5 dB, across various drone types, throttles, microphone configurations as well as environments. The dataset enables development and systematic evaluation of noise suppression and classification methods for human-presence detection under challenging conditions, while also informing practical design considerations for drone audition systems, such as microphone placement trade-offs, and development of drone noise-aware audio processing. This dataset is an important step towards enabling design and deployment of drone-audition systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS} (\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance \underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM}) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories.

<p>Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on, compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+ clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1) Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions (liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points (good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points (good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lee Qi Zun, Mohamad Zulhilmi Bin Abdul Halim, Goh Man Fye</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Liang, Zhihao Xu, Jialing Tao, Hui Xue, Xiting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchen Li, Xuzhao Li, Shiyu Hu, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework, which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and, crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our 7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence purity and the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Zhou, Yuhao Tan, Zenan Li, Yuan Yao, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li, Xiaoxing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Corazza, Hadi Partovi Aria, Daniel Neider, Zhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism, thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its strengths empirically.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that interventionally robust optimization problems in causal models are continuous under the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance, but may be discontinuous under the standard Wasserstein distance. This highlights the importance of using generative models that respect the causal structure when augmenting data for such tasks. To this end, we propose a new normalizing flow architecture that satisfies a universal approximation property for causal structural models and can be efficiently trained to minimize the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model outperforms standard (non-causal) generative models in data augmentation for causal regression and mean-variance portfolio optimization in causal factor models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmit Joshi, Gene Li, Siddharth Bhandari, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, Cong Ma, Nathan Srebro</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits, with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model (specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning from correct demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to real-world applications, powering services across diverse sectors. However, their widespread deployment has exposed critical security risks, particularly through jailbreak prompts that can bypass model alignment and induce harmful outputs. Despite intense research into both attack and defense techniques, the field remains fragmented: definitions, threat models, and evaluation criteria vary widely, impeding systematic progress and fair comparison. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we address these challenges by (1) proposing a holistic, multi-level taxonomy that organizes attacks, defenses, and vulnerabilities in LLM prompt security; (2) formalizing threat models and cost assumptions into machine-readable profiles for reproducible evaluation; (3) introducing an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized, auditable comparison of attacks and defenses; (4) releasing JAILBREAKDB, the largest annotated dataset of jailbreak and benign prompts to date; and (5) presenting a comprehensive evaluation and leaderboard of state-of-the-art methods. Our work unifies fragmented research, provides rigorous foundations for future studies, and supports the development of robust, trustworthy LLMs suitable for high-stakes deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muslim Chochlov, Gul Aftab Ahmed, James Vincent Patten, Yuanhua Han, Guoxian Lu, David Gregg, Jim Buckley</p>
<p>Abstract: Source code clones pose risks ranging from intellectual property violations to unintended vulnerabilities. Effective and efficient scalable clone detection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the rapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and potential LLM-ensemble efficacy.
  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering them down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The candidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and a commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though CodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates suggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and tailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a top-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\% precision: twice the precision of previously used CodeBERT.
  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the selected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results suggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods like maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling approach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the best-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\% over individual LLM on the commercial large-scale code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, but can they generate fast code? In this paper, we study this question using a dataset of 65 real-world tasks mined from open-source Java programs. We specifically select tasks where developers achieved significant speedups, and employ an automated pipeline to generate patches for these issues using two leading LLMs under four prompt variations. By rigorously benchmarking the results against the baseline and human-authored solutions, we demonstrate that LLM-generated code indeed improves performance over the baseline in most cases. However, patches proposed by human developers outperform LLM fixes by a statistically significant margin, indicating that LLMs often fall short of finding truly optimal solutions. We further find that LLM solutions are semantically identical or similar to the developer optimization idea in approximately two-thirds of cases, whereas they propose a more original idea in the remaining one-third. However, these original ideas only occasionally yield substantial performance gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woo-Jin Ahn, Sang-Ryul Baek, Yong-Jun Lee, Hyun-Duck Choi, Myo-Taeg Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator (i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training. Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a policy offline without further interaction with the real environment. Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains, what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150 meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples, providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics. Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards against various deception behaviors.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15502">The Road Less Traveled: Enhancing Exploration in LLMs via Sequential Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijia Kang, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution, potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janne Rotter, William Bailkoski</p>
<p>Abstract: AI has the potential to significantly improve how NGOs utilize their limited resources for societal benefits, but evidence about how NGOs adopt AI remains scattered. In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions, contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity, Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving effectiveness, engagement, and social impact.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulia Lanzillotta, Felix Sarnthein, Gil Kur, Thomas Hofmann, Bobby He</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works. Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension: dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning distillation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sibo Xiao, Jinyuan Fu, Zhongle Xie, Lidan Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vihari Piratla, Purvam Jain, Darshan Singh, Partha Talukdar, Trevor Cohn</p>
<p>Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning. Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 + Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is accepted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyu Lin, Marco Peer, Florian Kleber, Robert Sablatnig</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date, location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and 1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded, non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains, highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/linty5/ClapperText.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongjun Kim, Chanhee Park, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages. Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features, honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar endeavors for other underrepresented languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Aadithyan Rajesh Nair, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech disorders can significantly affect the patients capability to communicate, learn, and socialize. However, existing speech therapy solutions (e.g., therapist or tools) are still limited and costly, hence such solutions remain inadequate for serving millions of patients worldwide. To address this, state-of-the-art methods employ neural network (NN) algorithms to help accurately detecting speech disorders. However, these methods do not provide therapy recommendation as feedback, hence providing partial solution for patients. Moreover, these methods incur high energy consumption due to their complex and resource-intensive NN processing, hence hindering their deployments on low-power/energy platforms (e.g., smartphones). Toward this, we propose SpikeVox, a novel framework for enabling energy-efficient speech therapy solutions through spike-driven generative language model. Specifically, SpikeVox employs a speech recognition module to perform highly accurate speech-to-text conversion; leverages a spike-driven generative language model to efficiently perform pattern analysis for speech disorder detection and generates suitable exercises for therapy; provides guidance on correct pronunciation as feedback; as well as utilizes the REST API to enable seamless interaction for users. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeVox achieves 88% confidence level on average in speech disorder recognition, while providing a complete feedback for therapy exercises. Therefore, SpikeVox provides a comprehensive framework for energy-efficient speech therapy solutions, and potentially addresses the significant global speech therapy access gap.</p>

Art of X developed persona-conditioned LLM agents -- internally branded as "Sparks" and instantiated through a library of role-inspired system prompts -- to intentionally diversify agent behaviour within a multi-agent workflow. This white paper documents the problem framing, experimental design, and quantitative evidence behind the Spark agent programme. Using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol calibrated against human gold standards, we observe a mean diversity gain of +4.1 points (on a 1-10 scale) when persona-conditioned Spark agents replace a uniform system prompt, narrowing the gap to human experts to 1.0 point. We also surface evaluator bias and procedural considerations for future deployments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED), addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in microscopy workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Abbasi, Stefan Heindorf</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust. Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable, allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhisheng Yang, Xiaofei Xu, Ke Deng, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have been leveraged for crafting recommendations to achieve precise alignment with user preferences and elevate the quality of the recommendations. The existing approaches implement both non-tuning and tuning strategies. Compared to following the tuning strategy, the approaches following the non-tuning strategy avoid the relatively costly, time-consuming, and expertise-requiring process of further training pre-trained LLMs on task-specific datasets, but they suffer the issue of not having the task-specific business or local enterprise knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS). For our purpose, we train a separate machine-learning model called Critic that implements collaborative filtering for recommendations by learning from the interactions between many users and items. The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians' intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of 3D body joint positions synchronized with fisheye camera images, as well as accurate 3D pedestrian positions extracted from lidar data, facilitating robust benchmarking for perception algorithms. We release a portion of the dataset along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on embedded systems. By addressing real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide baseline performance metrics using custom neural network architectures and suggest future research directions to encourage the adoption and enhancement of the dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yung-Chen Tang, Pin-Yu Chen, Andrea Cavallaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling) improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However, popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$ increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM) retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$), a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning. Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency, with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level sampling strategies such as beam search.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prithwish Jana, Kaan Kale, Ahmet Ege Tanriverdi, Cruise Song, Sriram Vishwanath, Vijay Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating human-written mathematical theorems and proofs from natural language (NL) into formal languages (FLs) like Lean 4 has long been a significant challenge for AI. Most state-of-the-art methods address this separately, first translating theorems and then generating proofs, creating a fundamental disconnect vis-a-vis true proof auto-formalization. This two-step process and its limitations were evident even in AlphaProof's silver-medal performance at the 2024 IMO, where problem statements needed manual translation before automated proof synthesis.
  We present ProofBridge, a unified framework for automatically translating entire NL theorems and proofs into Lean 4. At its core is a joint embedding model that aligns NL and FL (NL-FL) theorem-proof pairs in a shared semantic space, enabling cross-modal retrieval of semantically relevant FL examples to guide translation. Our training ensures that NL-FL theorems (and their proofs) are mapped close together in this space if and only if the NL-FL pairs are semantically equivalent. ProofBridge integrates retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with iterative proof repair, leveraging Lean's type checker and semantic equivalence feedback to ensure both syntactic correctness and semantic fidelity. Experiments show substantial improvements in proof auto-formalization over strong baselines (including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5, Kimina-Prover, DeepSeek-Prover), with our retrieval-augmented approach yielding significant gains in semantic correctness (SC, via proving bi-directional equivalence) and type correctness (TC, via type-checking theorem+proof) across pass@k metrics on miniF2F-Test-PF, a dataset we curated. In particular, ProofBridge improves cross-modal retrieval quality by up to 3.28x Recall@1 over all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and achieves +31.14% SC and +1.64% TC (pass@32) compared to the baseline Kimina-Prover-RL-1.7B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Effrosyni Sokli, Pranav Kasela, Georgios Peikos, Gabriella Pasi</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs) are a prominent development in Information Retrieval (IR). A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters (i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as TinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning across benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and Contriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve improved retrieval performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerard Comas-Quiles, Carles Garcia-Cabrera, Julia Dietlmeier, Noel E. O'Connor, Ferran Marques</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD, particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kivanc Dogan, Ahmet Orhan</p>
<p>Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of 9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved 99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks, including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management. Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM. Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next, building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Gu, Bartosz Piotrowski, Fabian Gloeckle, Kaiyu Yang, Aram H. Markosyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce, and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs -- struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks, reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as training data for supervised finetuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binggui Zhou, Bruno Clerckx</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has recently been introduced to enable advanced control over electromagnetic waves to further increase the benefits of traditional RIS in enhancing signal quality and improving spectral and energy efficiency for next-generation wireless networks. A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore, how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities, which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edwin Hamel-De le Court, Gaspard Ohlmann, Francesco Belardinelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation. We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown in the experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyu Lin, Armin Dadras, Florian Kleber, Robert Sablatnig</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary, high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise, missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small, carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahyar Alinejad, Alvaro Velasquez, Yue Wang, George Atia</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to the true non-Markovian objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximo Eduardo Rulli, Simone Petruzzi, Edoardo Michielon, Fabrizio Silvestri, Simone Scardapane, Alessio Devoto</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gao Yang, Yuhang Liu, Siyu Miao, Xinyue Liang, Zhengyang Liu, Heyan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced, subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation, game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitong Sun, Yao Huang, Ruochen Zhang, Huanran Chen, Shouwei Ruan, Ranjie Duan, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content, especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms, can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jort de Jong, Mike Holenderski</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image. Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images, where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recently proposed Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) shows strong capabilities to replicate automotive computational fluid dynamics simulations requiring orders of magnitudes less compute than traditional numerical solvers. In this technical report, we add two new datasets to the body of empirically evaluated use-cases of AB-UPT, combining high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both datasets were generated with the Luminary Cloud platform containing automotives (SHIFT-SUV) and aircrafts (SHIFT-Wing). We start by detailing the data generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model. AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near perfect prediction of integrated aerodynamic forces within seconds from a simple isotopically tesselate geometry representation and is trainable within a day on a single GPU, paving the way for industry-scale applications.</p>

Maddix, Pablo Guerron, Tony Hu, Junming Yin, Nick Erickson, Prateek Mutalik Desai, Hao Wang, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis, Yuyang Wang, Michael Bohlke-Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco D'Alessandro, Leo D'Amato, Mikel Elkano, Mikel Uriz, Giovanni Pezzulo</p>
<p>Abstract: A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to explain how semantic and episodic memory, two major forms of declarative memory, typically associated with cortical and hippocampal processing, interact to support learning, recall, and imagination. Despite significant advances, we still lack a unified computational framework that jointly accounts for core empirical phenomena across both semantic and episodic processing domains. Here, we introduce the Generative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational model that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity generative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and generalization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and retrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS reproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic memory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in episodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their dynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the fidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces systematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can recombine previous experiences. Together, these results provide a principled account of memory as an active, constructive, and resource-bounded process. GENESIS thus advances a unified theoretical framework that bridges semantic and episodic memory, offering new insights into the generative foundations of human cognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Kallusky, Vinay Rao, Vishal Nandavanam, Hao-Jun Michael Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights. DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers, claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23 training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW and Muon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan Rokhva, Mousa Alizadeh, Maryam Abdollahi Shamami</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics (distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically dynamic domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Klamkin, Mathieu Tanneau, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems. However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengkai Wang, Qi Zuo, Pengwei Liu, Zhijie Sang, Congkai Xie, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Yu, Gang Li, Weiyan Shi, Peng Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed). Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum, leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web continuously.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxing Wei, Yao Shu, Ying Tiffany He, Fei Richard Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Hu, Weijia Li, Yangmengfei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Epistemic Planning (EP) is an important research area dedicated to reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of agents in multi-agent cooperative or adversarial settings. The Justified Perspective (JP) model is the state-of-the-art approach to solving EP problems with efficiency and expressiveness. However, all existing EP methods inherit the static environment assumption from classical planning. This limitation hinders the application of EP in fields such as robotics with multi-agent settings, where the environment contains changing variables.
  In this paper, we propose an extension of the JP model, namely, the Predictive Justified Perspective (PJP) model, to remove this assumption. Instead of assuming that beliefs remain unchanged since the last observation, the PJP model uses all past observations to form predictions about the changing variables. The definition of the prediction function with examples is provided, and it is demonstrated that it can work with arbitrary nesting. We then implemented the PJP model in several well-known domains and compared it with the JP model in the experiments. The results indicated that the PJP model performs exceptionally well across various domains, demonstrating its potential in improving EP applications in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Hu, Tim Miller, Nir Lipovetzky</p>
<p>Abstract: Epistemic planning is the sub-field of AI planning that focuses on changing knowledge and belief. It is important in both multi-agent domains where agents need to have knowledge/belief regarding the environment, but also the beliefs of other agents, including nested beliefs. When modeling knowledge in multi-agent settings, many models face an exponential growth challenge in terms of nested depth. A contemporary method, known as Planning with Perspectives (PWP), addresses these challenges through the use of perspectives and set operations for knowledge. The JP model defines that an agent's belief is justified if and only if the agent has seen evidence that this belief was true in the past and has not seen evidence to suggest that this has changed. The current paper extends the JP model to handle \emph{group belief}, including distributed belief and common belief. We call this the Group Justified Perspective (GJP) model. Using experimental problems crafted by adapting well-known benchmarks to a group setting, we show the efficiency and expressiveness of our GJP model at handling planning problems that cannot be handled by other epistemic planning tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Feng, Zhiyao Luo, Wei Wang, Yuting Song, Yong Liu, Tingting Zhu, Jianqing Li, Xingyao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set, CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust speech-based cognitive assessment tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel O. Badmus, Peng Sang, Dimitrios Stamoulis, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfu Jiang, Yi Lu, Zhuofeng Li, Zhiheng Lyu, Ping Nie, Haozhe Wang, Alex Su, Hui Chen, Kai Zou, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingru Fan, Yufan Dang, Jingyao Wu, Huatao Li, Runde Yang, Xiyuan Yang, Yuheng Wang, Chen Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that should be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, APPs, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose mobile agent that operates across applications. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end pipeline spanning data collection, training, finetuning, efficient inference, and PC/mobile application. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-APP and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile APP support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency and memory across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements on four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher precision of on screen actions, more reliable long horizon task completion, and faster, more resource efficient runtime. By articulating a cohesive position and a reference architecture that closes the loop from data collection, training to finetuning and efficient inference, this paper offers a concrete roadmap for general purpose mobile agent and provides actionable guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwen Chen, Zhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing: subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines, including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minki Kang, Wei-Ning Chen, Dongge Han, Huseyin A. Inan, Lukas Wutschitz, Yanzhi Chen, Robert Sim, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adi Banerjee, Anirudh Nair, Tarik Borogovac</p>
<p>Abstract: Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems. Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error attribution in multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma Kondrup, Anne Imouza</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings, considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust patient support.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Praphul Singh, Corey Barrett, Sumana Srivasta, Amitabh Saikia, Irfan Bulu, Sri Gadde, Krishnaram Kenthapadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability, and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning), producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient, reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders (Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient context to actionable clinical orders in real time.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846">Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo-Yang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative) paradigm based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konrad Hinsen (SSOLEIL, CBM)</p>
<p>Abstract: Since its beginnings in the 1940s, automated reasoning by computers has become a tool of ever growing importance in scientific research. So far, the rules underlying automated reasoning have mainly been formulated by humans, in the form of program source code. Rules derived from large amounts of data, via machine learning techniques, are a complementary approach currently under intense development. The question of why we should trust these systems, and the results obtained with their help, has been discussed by philosophers of science but has so far received little attention by practitioners. The present work focuses on independent reviewing, an important source of trust in science, and identifies the characteristics of automated reasoning systems that affect their reviewability. It also discusses possible steps towards increasing reviewability and trustworthiness via a combination of technical and social measures.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MotionScript, a novel framework for generating highly detailed, natural language descriptions of 3D human motions. Unlike existing motion datasets that rely on broad action labels or generic captions, MotionScript provides fine-grained, structured descriptions that capture the full complexity of human movement including expressive actions (e.g., emotions, stylistic walking) and interactions beyond standard motion capture datasets. MotionScript serves as both a descriptive tool and a training resource for text-to-motion models, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and diverse human motions from text. By augmenting motion datasets with MotionScript captions, we demonstrate significant improvements in out-of-distribution motion generation, allowing large language models (LLMs) to generate motions that extend beyond existing data. Additionally, MotionScript opens new applications in animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics, providing an interpretable bridge between intuitive descriptions and motion synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically translate 3D motion into structured natural language without requiring training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedaant Jain, Felipe dos Santos Alves Feitosa, Gabriel Kreiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in image segmentation and object detection, understanding complex scenes remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

<p>Abstract: Conditional music generation offers significant advantages in terms of user convenience and control, presenting great potential in AI-generated content research. However, building conditional generative systems for multitrack popular songs presents three primary challenges: insufficient fidelity of input conditions, poor structural modeling, and inadequate inter-track harmony learning in generative models. To address these issues, we propose BandCondiNet, a conditional model based on parallel Transformers, designed to process the multiple music sequences and generate high-quality multitrack samples. Specifically, we propose multi-view features across time and instruments as high-fidelity conditions. Moreover, we propose two specialized modules for BandCondiNet: Structure Enhanced Attention (SEA) to strengthen the musical structure, and Cross-Track Transformer (CTT) to enhance inter-track harmony. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations on two popular music datasets with different sequence lengths. Objective results on the shorter dataset show that BandCondiNet outperforms other conditional models in 9 out of 10 metrics related to fidelity and inference speed, with the exception of Chord Accuracy. On the longer dataset, BandCondiNet surpasses all conditional models across all 10 metrics. Subjective evaluations across four criteria reveal that BandCondiNet trained on the shorter dataset performs best in Richness and performs comparably to state-of-the-art models in the other three criteria, while significantly outperforming them across all criteria when trained on the longer dataset. To further expand the application scope of BandCondiNet, future work should focus on developing an advanced conditional model capable of adapting to more user-friendly input conditions and supporting flexible instrumentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiho Shin, Nima Shiri Harzevili, Reem Aleithan, Hadi Hemmati, Song Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced software engineering tasks but remains underexplored in unit test generation. To bridge this gap, we investigate the efficacy of RAG-based unit test generation for machine learning (ML/DL) APIs and analyze the impact of different knowledge sources on their effectiveness. We examine three domain-specific sources for RAG: (1) API documentation (official guidelines), (2) GitHub issues (developer-reported resolutions), and (3) StackOverflow Q&As (community-driven solutions). Our study focuses on five widely used Python-based ML/DL libraries, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Google JAX, and XGBoost, targeting the most-used APIs. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs -- GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Mistral MoE 8x22B, and Llama 3.1 405B -- across three strategies: basic instruction prompting, Basic RAG, and API-level RAG. Quantitatively, we assess syntactical and dynamic correctness and line coverage. While RAG does not enhance correctness, RAG improves line coverage by 6.5% on average. We found that GitHub issues result in the best improvement in line coverage by providing edge cases from various issues. We also found that these generated unit tests can help detect new bugs. Specifically, 28 bugs were detected, 24 unique bugs were reported to developers, ten were confirmed, four were rejected, and ten are awaiting developers' confirmation. Our findings highlight RAG's potential in unit test generation for improving test coverage with well-targeted knowledge sources. Future work should focus on retrieval techniques that identify documents with unique program states to optimize RAG-based unit test generation further.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Le-Cong, Bach Le, Toby Murray</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we first show that increases in beam size, even for small-sized LLMs (1B-7B params), require extensive GPU usage, leading to up to 80% of recurring crashes due to memory overloads in LLM-based APR. Seemingly simple solutions to reduce memory consumption are (1) to quantize LLM models, i.e., converting the weights of an LLM from high-precision values to lower-precision ones, and (2) to make beam search sequential, i.e., forwarding each beam through the model sequentially and then concatenating them back into a single output. However, we show that these approaches still do not work via both theoretical analysis and experiments.
  To address this, we introduce FLAMES, a novel LLM-based APR technique that employs semantic-guided patch generation to enhance repair effectiveness and memory efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on beam search, FLAMES utilizes greedy decoding to enhance memory efficiency while steering the search towards more potentially good repair candidates via a semantic-guided best-first search algorithm. At each decoding step, FLAMES uses semantic feedback from test validation, such as the number of passing and failing test cases, to select the most promising token to explore further. Our empirical evaluation on Defects4J shows thatFLAMES substantially reduces memory consumption by up to 83% compared to LLM-based APR without compromising time efficiency. Moreover, FLAMES correctly fixes 133 bugs on Defects4J, fixing 10 bugs more than the best baseline. Additionally, these improvements also generalize to the HumanEval-Java and TransformedD4J datasets, where FLAMES generates 12% and 36.5% more correct patches, respectively, than the best baseline.</p>

The first model adapts the prior based on observed data using a multivariate prior network, enhancing generalization across various posterior queries. In contrast, the second model utilizes a standard Gaussian prior, offering simplicity while still effectively capturing complex posterior distributions. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to approximate complex posteriors while maintaining computational efficiency on well-established benchmark problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Raghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent evidence, both in the lab and in the wild, suggests that the use of generative artificial intelligence reduces the diversity of content produced. The use of the same or similar AI models appears to lead to more homogeneous behavior. Our work begins with the observation that there is a force pushing in the opposite direction: compe- tition. When producers compete with one another (e.g., for customers or attention), they are incentivized to create novel or unique content. We explore the impact com- petition has on both content diversity and overall social welfare. Through a formal game-theoretic model, we show that competitive markets select for diverse AI models, mitigating monoculture. We further show that a generative AI model that performs well in isolation (i.e., according to a benchmark) may fail to provide value in a compet- itive market. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating generative AI models across the breadth of their output distributions, particularly when they will be deployed in competitive environments. We validate our results empirically by using language models to play Scattergories, a word game in which players are rewarded for answers that are both correct and unique. Overall, our results suggest that homogenization due to generative AI is unlikely to persist in competitive markets, and instead, competition in downstream markets may drive diversification in AI model development</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devendra Vyas, Nikola Pi\v{z}urica, Nikola Milovi\'c, Igor Jovan\v{c}evi\'c, Miguel de Prado, Tim Verbelen</p>
<p>Abstract: TinyML has made deploying deep learning models on low-power edge devices feasible, creating new opportunities for real-time perception in constrained environments. However, the adaptability of such deep learning methods remains limited to data drift adaptation, lacking broader capabilities that account for the environment's underlying dynamics and inherent uncertainty. Deep learning's scaling laws, which counterbalance this limitation by massively up-scaling data and model size, cannot be applied when deploying on the Edge, where deep learning limitations are further amplified as models are scaled down for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
  This paper presents an innovative agentic system capable of performing on-device perception and planning, enabling active sensing on the edge. By incorporating active inference into our solution, our approach extends beyond deep learning capabilities, allowing the system to plan in dynamic environments while operating in real-time with a compact memory footprint of as little as 300 MB. We showcase our proposed system by creating and deploying a saccade agent connected to an IoT camera with pan and tilt capabilities on an NVIDIA Jetson embedded device. The saccade agent controls the camera's field of view following optimal policies derived from the active inference principles, simulating human-like saccadic motion for surveillance and robotics applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Zhuang, Yu Zhang, Yan Zhang, Ying Qian, Aimin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrosynthesis plays a crucial role in the fields of organic synthesis and drug development, where the goal is to identify suitable reactants that can yield a target product molecule. Although existing methods have achieved notable success, they typically overlook the 3D conformational details and internal spatial organization of molecules. This oversight makes it challenging to predict reactants that conform to genuine chemical principles, particularly when dealing with complex molecular structures, such as polycyclic and heteroaromatic compounds. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel transformer-based, template-free approach that incorporates 3D conformer data and spatial information. Our approach includes an Atom-align Fusion module that integrates 3D positional data at the input stage, ensuring correct alignment between atom tokens and their respective 3D coordinates. Additionally, we propose a Distance-weighted Attention mechanism that refines the self-attention process, constricting the model s focus to relevant atom pairs in 3D space. Extensive experiments on the USPTO-50K dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms previous template-free methods, setting a new benchmark for the field. A case study further highlights our method s ability to predict reasonable and accurate reactants.</p>

<p>Abstract: As LLMs increasingly impact safety-critical applications, ensuring their safety using guardrails remains a key challenge. This paper proposes GuardReasoner, a new safeguard for LLMs, by guiding the guard model to learn to reason. Concretely, we first create the GuardReasonerTrain dataset, which consists of 127K samples with 460K detailed reasoning steps. Then, we introduce reasoning SFT to unlock the reasoning capability of guard models. In addition, we present hard sample DPO to further strengthen their reasoning ability. In this manner, GuardReasoner achieves better performance, explainability, and generalizability. Extensive experiments and analyses on 13 benchmarks of 3 guardrail tasks demonstrate its superiority. Remarkably, GuardReasoner 8B surpasses GPT-4o+CoT by 5.74% and LLaMA Guard 3 8B by 20.84% F1 score on average. We release the training data, code, and models with different scales (1B, 3B, 8B) of GuardReasoner : https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Tegon, Thorir Mar Ingolfsson, Xiaying Wang, Luca Benini, Yawei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is essential for detecting seizures and artifacts in long-term monitoring, with applications spanning hospital diagnostics to wearable health devices. Robust EEG analytics have the potential to greatly improve patient care. However, traditional deep learning models, especially Transformer-based architectures, are hindered by their quadratic time and memory complexity, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we present FEMBA (Foundational EEG Mamba + Bidirectional Architecture), a novel self-supervised framework that establishes new efficiency benchmarks for EEG analysis through bidirectional state-space modeling. Unlike Transformer-based models, which incur quadratic time and memory complexity, FEMBA scales linearly with sequence length, enabling more scalable and efficient processing of extended EEG recordings. Trained on over 21,000 hours of unlabeled EEG and fine-tuned on three downstream tasks, FEMBA achieves competitive performance in comparison with transformer models, with significantly lower computational cost. Specifically, it reaches 81.82% balanced accuracy (0.8921 AUROC) on TUAB and 0.949 AUROC on TUAR, while a tiny 7.8M-parameter variant demonstrates viability for resource-constrained devices. These results pave the way for scalable, general-purpose EEG analytics in both clinical and highlight FEMBA as a promising candidate for wearable applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxing Wei, Yao Shu, Mingwen Ou, Ying Tiffany He, Fei Richard Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often causes overfitting to specific prompt wording, where minor phrasing variations drastically reduce performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning (PAFT), a method that enhances robustness through dynamic prompt variation during training. PAFT first generates diverse synthetic prompts, then continuously samples from this set to construct training instances, forcing models to learn fundamental task principles rather than surface-level patterns. Across systematic evaluations using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT), PAFT demonstrates substantially improved prompt robustness, achieving 7% higher generalization accuracy on unseen prompts than standard methods. In addition to enhanced robustness, PAFT consistently yields superior overall performance on established benchmarks for question answering, mathematical reasoning, and tool use. Notably, models trained with PAFT attain 3.2 faster inference speeds due to reduced prompt sensitivity. Ablation studies further validate effectiveness of PAFT, while theoretical analysis reveals that PAFT can effectively enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpan Mahara, Naphtali Rishe</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has enabled the synthesis of high-quality multimedia data. However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have predominantly focused on deepfake detection and often overlook recent advancements in synthetic image forensics, particularly approaches that incorporate multimodal frameworks, reasoning-based detection, and training-free methodologies. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. The review systematically examines core detection paradigms, categorizes them into spatial-domain, frequency-domain, fingerprint-based, patch-based, training-free, and multimodal reasoning-based frameworks, and offers concise descriptions of their underlying principles. We further provide detailed comparative analyses of these methods on publicly available datasets to assess their generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the potential of hybrid frameworks that combine the efficiency of training-free approaches with the semantic reasoning of multimodal models to advance trustworthy and explainable synthetic image forensics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B\'alint T\'oth, Dominik Senti, Thorir Mar Ingolfsson, Jeffrey Zweidler, Alexandre Elsig, Luca Benini, Yawei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) is a key indicator of cardiovascular health. As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamin Koo, Jaehyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress across a wide range of tasks, yet their heavy reliance on English-centric training data leads to significant performance degradation in non-English languages. While existing multilingual prompting methods emphasize reformulating queries into English or enhancing reasoning capabilities, they often fail to incorporate the language- and culture-specific grounding that is essential for some queries. To address this limitation, we propose EMCee (Extracting synthetic Multilingual Context and merging), a simple yet effective framework that enhances the multilingual capabilities of LLMs by explicitly extracting and utilizing query-relevant knowledge from the LLM itself. In particular, EMCee first extracts synthetic context to uncover latent, language-specific knowledge encoded within the LLM, and then dynamically merges this contextual insight with reasoning-oriented outputs through a judgment-based selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on four multilingual benchmarks covering diverse languages and tasks demonstrate that EMCee consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving an average relative improvement of 16.4% overall and 31.7% in low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Huang, Xi Qiu, Yukuo Ma, Yifu Zhou, Junjie Chen, Hongyuan Zhang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pau Rodriguez, Michal Klein, Eleonora Gualdoni, Valentino Maiorca, Arno Blaas, Luca Zappella, Marco Cuturi, Xavier Suau</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient mechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or provide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms should require low volume of unpaired data (i.e., without explicit preference), and should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap, these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layer-wise distributional shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron selection. LinEAS only requires a handful of unpaired samples to be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation in language models, becoming competitive with oracle-dependent methods that have access to strong supervision. LinEAS is modality-agnostic and we empirically find that it outperforms existing activation steering methods at mitigating and including new concepts at the output of single-step text-to-image generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nir Ailon, Akhiad Bercovich, Omri Weinstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI relies on huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls), whose computation poses a scalability problem for inference and training. We propose an alternative, GPU native bilinear operator to MatMuls in neural networks, which offers a three-way tradeoff between: speed, accuracy and parameter count. In particular, this operator requires substantially fewer FLOPs to evaluate ($\ll n^3$), yet increases the parameter count compared to MatMul ($\gg n^2$). We call this operator Strassen-Tile (STL). The key idea behind STL is a local learnable change-of-basis, applied on tiles of the weight and activation matrices, followed by an element-wise product between the tiles, implemented simultaneously via MatMul. The key technical question we study is how to optimize the change-of-basis of a given layer, which is a highly non-convex problem. We show that theory-backed initializations (inspired by fast matrix and polynomial multiplication) lead to substantially better accuracy than random SGD initialization. This phenomenon motivates further algorithmic study of STL optimization in DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that STL can approximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by a factor of 2.66, and can improve Imagenet-1K accuracy of SoTA T2T-ViT-7 (4.3M parameters) while lowering FLOPs. Even with non-CUDA optimized PyTorch code, STL achieves wall-clock speedups in the compute-bound regime. These results, together with its theoretical grounds, suggest STL as a promising building block for scalable and cost-efficient AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Chen, Wei Ma, Lingxiao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark.
  Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p>

<p>Abstract: People without a database background usually rely on file systems or tools such as Excel for data management, which often lead to redundancy and data inconsistency. Relational databases possess strong data management capabilities, but require a high level of professional expertise from users. Although there are already many works on Text2SQL to automate the translation of natural language into SQL queries for data manipulation, all of them presuppose that the database schema is pre-designed. In practice, schema design itself demands domain expertise, and research on directly generating schemas from textual requirements remains unexplored. In this paper, we systematically define a new problem, called Text2Schema, to convert a natural language text requirement into a relational database schema. With an effective Text2Schema technique, users can effortlessly create database table structures using natural language, and subsequently leverage existing Text2SQL techniques to perform data manipulations, which significantly narrows the gap between non-technical personnel and highly efficient, versatile relational database systems. We propose SchemaAgent, an LLM-based multi-agent framework for Text2Schema. We emulate the workflow of manual schema design by assigning specialized roles to agents and enabling effective collaboration to refine their respective subtasks. We also incorporate dedicated roles for reflection and inspection, along with an innovative error detection and correction mechanism to identify and rectify issues across various phases. Moreover, we build and open source a benchmark containing 381 pairs of requirement description and schema. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over comparative work.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper challenges the argument that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is entitled to broad immunity from copyright law for reproducing copyrighted works without authorization due to a fair use defense. It examines fair use legal arguments and eight distinct substantive arguments, contending that every legal and substantive argument favoring fair use for GenAI applies equally, if not more so, to humans. Therefore, granting GenAI exceptional privileges in this domain is legally and logically inconsistent with withholding broad fair use exemptions from individual humans. It would mean no human would need to pay for virtually any copyright work again. The solution is to take a circumspect view of any fair use claim for mass copyright reproduction by any entity and focus on the first principles of whether permitting such exceptionalism for GenAI promotes science and the arts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present \emph{Structural Video Diffusion}, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyang Cao, Juekai Lin, Hongye Wang, Wenhao Li, Bo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liam Schoneveld, Zhe Chen, Davide Davoli, Jiapeng Tang, Saimon Terazawa, Ko Nishino, Matthias Nie{\ss}ner</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction of human heads from monocular images and videos underlies numerous visual applications. As 3D ground truth data is hard to come by at scale, previous methods have sought to learn from abundant 2D videos in a self-supervised manner. Typically, this involves the use of differentiable mesh rendering, which is effective but faces limitations. To improve on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor Learned via 2D Gaussians). Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a set of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged head avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to both the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians for rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised approach. Training solely on 2D data, our method surpasses existing self-supervised approaches in geometric evaluations on the NoW benchmark for neutral faces and a new benchmark for non-neutral expressions. Our method also produces highly expressive meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art in emotion classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Corrias, Fabio De Gaspari, Dorjan Hitaj, Luigi V. Mancini</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have led to their application in password guessing, with the aim of replicating the complexity, structure, and patterns of human-created passwords. Despite their potential, inconsistencies and inadequate evaluation methodologies in prior research have hindered meaningful comparisons and a comprehensive, unbiased understanding of their capabilities. This paper introduces MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play benchmarking framework designed to facilitate the systematic characterization and benchmarking of generative password-guessing models in the context of trawling attacks. Using MAYA, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of six state-of-the-art approaches, which we re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization. Our evaluation spans eight real-world password datasets and covers an exhaustive set of advanced testing scenarios, totaling over 15,000 compute hours. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, the diverse password distributions learned by the models enable a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark generative password-guessing models. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/williamcorrias/MAYA-Password-Benchmarking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulia Otmakhova, Hung Thinh Truong, Rahmad Mahendra, Zenan Zhai, Rongxin Zhu, Daniel Beck, Jey Han Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic robustness Evaluation), a framework for assessing model robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels -- from orthography to dialect and style -- and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across six diverse NLP tasks (four classification and two generation tasks), and reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent, with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2) LLMs still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations, with reasoning LLMs surprisingly showing less robustness on some tasks compared to base models; (3) models are overall more brittle to natural, fluent modifications such as syntax or style changes (and especially to negation), compared to corruption-style tests such as letter flipping; (4) the ability of a model to use a linguistic feature in generation does not correlate to its robustness to this feature on downstream tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing for understanding model behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yui Lo, Yuqian Chen, Dongnan Liu, Leo Zekelman, Jarrett Rushmore, Yogesh Rathi, Nikos Makris, Alexandra J. Golby, Fan Zhang, Weidong Cai, Lauren J. O'Donnell</p>
<p>Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiling Zheng, Xian Zhong, Bin Liu, Yi Xiao, Bihan Wen, Xiaofeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and underexploited spectral complementarity. Existing approaches often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes, resulting in feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in the Fourier domain. This design reinforces shared structures while preserving complementary characteristics, thereby enhancing fusion quality. Unlike previous methods that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency spectra, PAD explicitly introduces amplitude-phase decoupling for multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via convolution-guided scaling to improve geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high- and low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons, effectively exploiting SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Gallici, Ivan Masmitja, Mario Mart\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AV) offer a cost-effective solution for scientific missions such as underwater tracking. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations, they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified, GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets. This work bridges the gap between large-scale MARL training and high-fidelity deployment, providing a scalable framework for autonomous fleet control in real-world sea missions.</p>

While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, they do not provide any uncertainty quantification for predictive means, quantiles, or similar quantities. We propose a principled and efficient sampling procedure to construct Bayesian posteriors for such estimates based on Martingale posteriors, and prove its convergence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilong Wang, John Bloch, Zedian Shao, Yuepeng Hu, Shuyan Zhou, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. In this work, we propose WebInject, a prompt injection attack that manipulates the webpage environment to induce a web agent to perform an attacker-specified action. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the attacker-specified action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets shows that WebInject is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Vinh La, Minh-Hieu Nguyen, Minh-Son Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1) Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to semantically grounded verification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saqib Qamar, Mohd Fazil, Parvez Ahmad, Shakir Khan, Abu Taha Zamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical applications; however, existing deep learning models face trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) capture local details well but miss the global context, whereas transformers handle the global context but at a high computational cost. Recently, State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have shown potential for capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity; however, their direct use in medical image segmentation remains limited due to incompatibility with image structures and autoregressive assumptions. To overcome these challenges, we propose SAMA-UNet, a novel U-shaped architecture that introduces two key innovations. First, the Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block adaptively integrates local and global features through dynamic attention weighting, enabling an efficient representation of complex anatomical patterns. Second, the causal resonance multi-scale module (CR-MSM) improves encoder-decoder interactions by adjusting feature resolution and causal dependencies across scales, enhancing the semantic alignment between low- and high-level features. Extensive experiments on MRI, CT, and endoscopy datasets demonstrate that SAMA-UNet consistently outperforms CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods. It achieves 85.38% DSC and 87.82% NSD on BTCV, 92.16% and 96.54% on ACDC, 67.14% and 68.70% on EndoVis17, and 84.06% and 88.47% on ATLAS23, establishing new benchmarks across modalities. These results confirm the effectiveness of SAMA-UNet in combining efficiency and accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical segmentation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deok-Hyeon Cho, Hyung-Seok Oh, Seung-Bin Kim, Seong-Whan Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion embeddings.</p>

We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. However, the topology of these systems--how agents in MASs should be configured, connected, and coordinated--remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we call for a paradigm shift toward \emph{topology-aware MASs} that explicitly model and dynamically optimize the structure of inter-agent interactions. We identify three fundamental components--agents, communication links, and overall topology--that collectively determine the system's adaptability, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. To operationalize this vision, we introduce a systematic three-stage framework: 1) agent selection, 2) structure profiling, and 3) topology synthesis. This framework not only provides a principled foundation for designing MASs but also opens new research frontiers across language modeling, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling to ultimately unleash their full potential in complex real-world applications. We conclude by outlining key challenges and opportunities in MASs evaluation. We hope our framework and perspectives offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24623">Hyperbolic Dataset Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyuan Li, Guang Li, Keisuke Maeda, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the computational and storage challenges posed by large-scale datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points, overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model performance, while significantly improving training stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate the hyperbolic space into the dataset distillation process. The code is available at https://github.com/Guang000/HDD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is essential for robust financial analysis; yet, current benchmarks largely overlook this capability. Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yin, Lijun Gu, Paritosh Parmar, Lin Xu, Tianxiao Guo, Weiwei Fu, Yang Zhang, Tianyou Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) -- the task of quantifying how well an action is performed -- has great potential for detecting errors in gym weight training, where accurate feedback is critical to prevent injuries and maximize gains. Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multiview recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction -- including the novel Video$\rightarrow$EMG task -- and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question-answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multiview video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beatrix M. G. Nielsen, Emanuele Marconato, Andrea Dittadi, Luigi Gresele</p>
<p>Abstract: When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models, we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar representations. We prove that a small Kullback--Leibler divergence between the model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations are similar. This has the important corollary that models with near-maximum data likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations -- a phenomenon mirrored in our experiments with models trained on CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and have more similar representations. Our results thus clarify the link between closeness in distribution and representational similarity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengcao Cao, Zijun Wei, Jason Kuen, Kangning Liu, Lingzhi Zhang, Jiuxiang Gu, HyunJoon Jung, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Guo, Yu Yang, Pan Xu, Anqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline source and limited target datasets with mismatched dynamics. Existing methods either penalize the reward or discard source transitions occurring in parts of the transition space with high dynamics shift. As a result, they optimize the policy using data from low-shift regions, limiting exploration of high-reward states in the target domain that do not fall within these regions. Consequently, such methods often fail when the dynamics shift is significant or the optimal trajectories lie outside the low-shift regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics Offline RL algorithm that optimizes a policy using learned target dynamics transitions to explore the target domain, rather than only being trained with the low dynamics-shift transitions. For the dynamics learning, built on the observation that achieving the same next state requires taking different actions in different domains, MOBODY employs separate action encoders for each domain to encode different actions to the shared latent space while sharing a unified representation of states and a common transition function. We further introduce a target Q-weighted behavior cloning loss in policy optimization to avoid out-of-distribution actions, which push the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than high source domain Q-values or uniformly imitating all actions in the offline dataset. We evaluate MOBODY on a wide range of MuJoCo and Adroit benchmarks, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art off-dynamics RL baselines as well as policy learning methods based on different dynamics learning baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios where existing methods struggle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Chen, Mingxi Zou, Zhuo Wang, Qifan Wang, Dongning Sun, Chi Zhang, Zenglin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models, demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval, confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better risk-adjusted returns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wu, Geng Hong, Pei Chen, Yueyue Chen, Xudong Pan, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal potential across five traits: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured crime scenarios adapted from classic films grounded in reality, we evaluate both criminal potential and anti-crime ability of LLMs. Results show that state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize deceptive behavior with only 44% accuracy on average, revealing a striking mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment, and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernard Lange, Anil Yildiz, Mansur Arief, Shehryar Khattak, Mykel Kochenderfer, Georgios Georgakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed information flows, limiting their generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge for reasoning and planning, but prior LVLM-robot integrations have largely depended on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and rigid control logic. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools drawn from modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select navigation actions. This agentic formulation enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, offering a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA outperforms state-of-the-art EQA-specific approaches. Qualitative results on RxR and custom tasks further demonstrate its ability to generalize across a broad range of navigation challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timofei Miryashkin, Olga Klimanova, Alexander Shapeev</p>
<p>Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V) binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this disagreement, we use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential with Bayesian inference of free energy surface. This workflow enables construction of the Ti-V phase diagram across the full composition range with systematically reduced statistical and finite-size errors. The resulting diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because our simulations model a perfectly oxygen-free Ti-V system, the observed gap cannot originate from impurity effects, in contrast to recent CALPHAD reassessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Yang, Yueru Luo, Bingkun He, Hongbin Lin, Suzhong Fu, Chao Zheng, Zhipeng Cao, Erlong Li, Chao Yan, Shuguang Cui, Zhen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tal Fiskus, Uri Shaham</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents excel in solving complex decision-making tasks across various domains. However, they often require a substantial number of training steps and a vast experience replay buffer, leading to significant computational and resource demands. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that focus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the factual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer, effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and SAC, achieve up to 383% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at a negligible cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melih Barsbey, Ant\^onio H. Ribeiro, Umut \c{S}im\c{s}ekli, Tolga Birdal</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhong Deng, Chao Tang, Cunjun Yu, Linfeng Li, David Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain limited to specific clothes types and tasks, due to the complex, high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes manipulation over diverse clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long dresses, ..., as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, .... The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints-e.g., ''left sleeve'' and ''right shoulder''-a sparse spatial-semantic representation, salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective representation for a wide range of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints as an intermediate representation to connect high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a set of pre-built manipulation skills conditioned on the keypoints. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four distinct tasks-folding, flattening, hanging, and placing-confirm CLASP's performance on real-life clothes manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoyoung Lee, Junhyuk Seo, Suhwan Park, Junhyeong Lee, Wonbin Ahn, Chanyeol Choi, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, Yongjae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts arising from discrepancies between their pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts are especially problematic in real-world investment services, where a model's inherent biases can misalign with institutional objectives, leading to unreliable recommendations. Despite this risk, the intrinsic investment biases of LLMs remain underexplored. We propose an experimental framework to investigate emergent behaviors in such conflict scenarios, offering a quantitative analysis of bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent biases of models and measure their persistence. Our analysis, centered on sector, size, and momentum, reveals distinct, model-specific biases. Across most models, a tendency to prefer technology stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian strategies is observed. These foundational biases often escalate into confirmation bias, causing models to cling to initial judgments even when faced with increasing counter-evidence. A public leaderboard benchmarking bias across a broader set of models is available at https://linqalpha.com/leaderboard</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shida Wang, Chaohu Liu, Yubo Wang, Linli Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data, and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off: intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel framework that leverages knowledge editing to inject semantically coherent natural language fingerprints through sparse, targeted modifications to model weights. Our approach introduces Promote-Suppress Value Vector Optimization, which simultaneously enhances target token likelihood while suppressing competing tokens, ensuring robust fingerprint integration without degrading core model functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves 95-100% fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on downstream benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under 2 minutes using less than 30 GB of GPU memory, which represents a substantial reduction in resource requirements. These advances establish FPEdit as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility, thereby providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance, knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of transformers fundamentally limits reasoning system deployment in resource-constrained and long-context settings. We introduce Hydra, a modular architecture based upon a state-space backbone which adaptively routes between complementary efficiency mechanisms: sparse global attention, mixture-of-experts, and dual memories comprising a reasoning workspace and product key memory. We evaluate a 29M parameter model measuring logical chaining accuracy and throughput on synthetic sequences, plus throughput on WikiText. Ablation studies use component-specific synthetic datasets to isolate individual mechanisms. Hydra achieves $3.01\times$ and $3.0\times$ throughput gains at 8K tokens for synthetic and WikiText datasets, respectively, and $10\times$ accuracy improvements on multi-step logical composition compared to equal-sized transformers. Ablations confirm each component's contribution: sparse attention captures long-range dependencies, experts specialize to input domains, and product key memory enables selective retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifu Wen, Xi Zeng, Zihan Zhou, Shuaijun Liu, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh, Ningxin Su, Reza Rawassizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose \textit{GradES}, a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning for both language and vision-language models. \textit{GradES} tracks the magnitude of gradient changes in backpropagation for these matrices during training. When a projection matrix's magnitude of gradient changes fall below a convergence threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow converging matrices to continue learning. \textit{GradES} speeds up training time by 1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2\% higher average accuracy in language tasks and 3.88\% on multimodal benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergey Pozdnyakov, Philippe Schwaller</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models. We introduce a general-purpose drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Li, Jiaran Hao, Jason Klein Liu, Zhijian Zhou, Yanting Miao, Wei Pang, Xiaoyu Tan, Wei Chu, Zhe Wang, Shirui Pan, Chao Qu, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective: using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework, Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Chen, Long Li, Teng Xi, Long Zeng, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasser H. Khalil, Mehdi Setayesh, Hongliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget" data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining "retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Swanda, Amy Chang, Alexander Chen, Fraser Burch, Paul Kassianik, Konstantin Berlin</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability, multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjun Wang, Shuo Cai, Congkai Xie, Mingfa Feng, Yiming Zhang, Zhen Li, Kejing Yang, Ming Li, Jiannong Cao, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Jake Lever, Edmond S. L. Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Huang, Decheng Wu, Rui Cen, Guanghua Yu, Zonghang Li, Kai Liu, Jianchen Zhu, Peng Chen, Xue Liu, Dapeng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct, meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Tang, Ruijie Liu, Yifan Wang, Shiyu Li, Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications. However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training. In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by 91.0% compared to the vanilla method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ioannis Mavrothalassitis, Pol Puigdemont, Noam Itzhak Levi, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.</p>

<p>Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios, existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexin Wang, Xiaolei Wang, Yizheng Gong, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Cristofoletto, Cesare Rollo, Giovanni Birolo, Piero Fariselli</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed- form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional- hazards. We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art approach, while maintaining a physics- based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin-Qiang Cai, Wei Wang, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical $\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward} correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an \textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a \textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared with other state-of-the-art contenders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rikuo Sasaki, Michimasa Inaba</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have highlighted its application in captology, the field of using computers as persuasive technologies. We hypothesized that the "conformity effect," where individuals align with others' actions, also occurs with AI agents. This study verifies this hypothesis by introducing a "Persuadee Agent" that is persuaded alongside a human participant in a three-party persuasive dialogue with a Persuader Agent. We conducted a text-based dialogue experiment with human participants. We compared four conditions manipulating the Persuadee Agent's behavior (persuasion acceptance vs. non-acceptance) and the presence of an icebreaker session. Results showed that when the Persuadee Agent accepted persuasion, both perceived persuasiveness and actual attitude change significantly improved. Attitude change was greatest when an icebreaker was also used, whereas an unpersuaded AI agent suppressed attitude change. Additionally, it was confirmed that the persuasion acceptance of participants increased at the moment the Persuadee Agent was persuaded. These results suggest that appropriately designing a Persuadee Agent can improve persuasion through the conformity effect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avichal Goel, Yoon Kim, Nir Shavit, Tony T. Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Scimeca, Thomas Jiralerspong, Berton Earnshaw, Jason Hartford, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities. Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models, followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Chen, Zhimeng Guo, Jiyun Chun, Pichao Wang, Andrew Perrault, Micha Elsner</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models (LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict. In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen, Filza Khan Tareen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2 (CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories: clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs. These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyu Xie, Bin Wang, Fanjing Kong, Jincheng Li, Dawei Liang, Ji Ao, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Jia, Yupei Liu, Zedian Shao, Jinyuan Jia, Neil Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt injection attacks deceive a large language model into completing an attacker-specified task instead of its intended task by contaminating its input data with an injected prompt, which consists of injected instruction(s) and data. Localizing the injected prompt within contaminated data is crucial for post-attack forensic analysis and data recovery. Despite its growing importance, prompt injection localization remains largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing PromptLocate, the first method for localizing injected prompts. PromptLocate comprises three steps: (1) splitting the contaminated data into semantically coherent segments, (2) identifying segments contaminated by injected instructions, and (3) pinpointing segments contaminated by injected data. We show PromptLocate accurately localizes injected prompts across eight existing and eight adaptive attacks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13865">Deep Edge Filter: Return of the Human-Crafted Layer in Deep Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkwan Lee, Junhoo Lee, Nojun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability. Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components, providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filipe Laitenberger, Dawid Kopiczko, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15% compute while retaining over 90% of baseline accuracy. For increasingly larger models, this tradeoff improves drastically. On instruction-tuned models we see accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50% savings. The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization, pruning, and self-speculative decoding.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14391">Beat Tracking as Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehoon Ahn, Moon-Ryul Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent beat and downbeat tracking models (e.g., RNNs, TCNs, Transformers) output frame-level activations. We propose reframing this task as object detection, where beats and downbeats are modeled as temporal "objects." Adapting the FCOS detector from computer vision to 1D audio, we replace its original backbone with WaveBeat's temporal feature extractor and add a Feature Pyramid Network to capture multi-scale temporal patterns. The model predicts overlapping beat/downbeat intervals with confidence scores, followed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) to select final predictions. This NMS step serves a similar role to DBNs in traditional trackers, but is simpler and less heuristic. Evaluated on standard music datasets, our approach achieves competitive results, showing that object detection techniques can effectively model musical beats with minimal adaptation.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14513">State Your Intention to Steer Your Attention: An AI Assistant for Intentional Digital Living</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Juheon Choi, Juyong Lee, Jian Kim, Chanyoung Kim, Taywon Min, W. Bradley Knox, Min Kyung Lee, Kimin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention, assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22 participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning their digital behavior with their intentions.
