<p><b>Authors:</b> Mutahira Khalid, Raihana Rahman, Asim Abbas, Sushama Kumari, Iram Wajahat, Syed Ahmad Chan Bukhari</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as powerful tools for organizing and representing structured knowledge. While their utility is widely recognized, challenges persist in their automation and completeness. Despite efforts in automation and the utilization of expert-created ontologies, gaps in connectivity remain prevalent within KGs. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative approach termed ``Medical Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA)". M-KGA leverages user-provided medical concepts and enriches them semantically using BioPortal ontologies, thereby enhancing the completeness of knowledge graphs through the integration of pre-trained embeddings. Our approach introduces two distinct methodologies for uncovering hidden connections within the knowledge graph: a cluster-based approach and a node-based approach. Through rigorous testing involving 100 frequently occurring medical concepts in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), our M-KGA framework demonstrates promising results, indicating its potential to address the limitations of existing knowledge graph automation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\^olin Gabriel Rasoanaivo (IRIT, UT Capitole, IRIT-ADRIA), Morteza Yazdani (UIV), Pascale Zarat\'e (IRIT, UT Capitole, IRIT-ADRIA), Amirhossein Fateh (UPV)</p>
<p>Abstract: Each decision-making tool should be tested and validated in real case studies to be practical and fit to global problems. The application of multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) is currently a trend to rank alternatives. In the literature, there are several multi-criteria decision-making methods according to their classification. During our experimentation on the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method, we encountered its limits for real cases. The authors examined the applicability of the CoCoFISo method (improved version of combined compromise solution), by a real case study in a university campus and compared the obtained results to other MCDMs such as Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), Weighted Sum Method (WSM) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Our research finding indicates that CoCoSo is an applied method that has been developed to solve complex multi variable assessment problems, while CoCoFISo can improve the shortages observed in CoCoSo and deliver stable outcomes compared to other developed tools. The findings imply that application of CoCoFISo is suggested to decision makers, experts and researchers while they are facing practical challenges and sensitive questions regarding the utilization of a reliable decision-making method. Unlike many prior studies, the current version of CoCoSo is unique, original and is presented for the first time. Its performance was approved using several strategies and examinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Timothy Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological intelligence uses a "multiscale competency architecture" (MCA). It exhibits adaptive, goal directed behaviour at all scales, from cells to organs to organisms. In contrast, machine intelligence is only adaptive and goal directed at a high level. Learned policies are passively interpreted using abstractions (e.g. arithmetic) embodied in static interpreters (e.g. x86). Biological intelligence excels at causal learning. Machine intelligence does not. Previous work showed causal learning follows from weak policy optimisation, which is hindered by presupposed abstractions in silico. Here we formalise MCAs as nested "agentic abstraction layers", to understand how they might learn causes. We show that weak policy optimisation at low levels enables weak policy optimisation at high. This facilitates what we call "multiscale causal learning" and high level goal directed behaviour. We argue that by engineering human abstractions in silico we disconnect high level goal directed behaviour from the low level goal directed behaviour that gave rise to it. This inhibits causal learning, and we speculate this is one reason why human recall would be accompanied by feeling, and in silico recall not.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02327">CausalDisco: Causal discovery using knowledge graph link prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Utkarshani Jaimini, Cory Henson, Amit P. Sheth</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery is a process of discovering new causal relations from observational data. Traditional causal discovery methods often suffer from issues related to missing data To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach called CausalDisco that formulates causal discovery as a knowledge graph completion problem. More specifically, the task of discovering causal relations is mapped to the task of knowledge graph link prediction. CausalDisco supports two types of discovery: causal explanation and causal prediction. The causal relations have weights representing the strength of the causal association between entities in the knowledge graph. An evaluation of this approach uses a benchmark dataset of simulated videos for causal reasoning, CLEVRER-Humans, and compares the performance of multiple knowledge graph embedding algorithms. In addition, two distinct dataset splitting approaches are utilized within the evaluation: (1) random-based split, which is the method typically used to evaluate link prediction algorithms, and (2) Markov-based split, a novel data split technique for evaluating link prediction that utilizes the Markovian property of the causal relation. Results show that using weighted causal relations improves causal discovery over the baseline without weighted relations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02336">Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-Native Wireless Systems: A Journey Beyond 6G</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Walid Saad, Omar Hashash, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Christina Chaccour, Merouane Debbah, Narayan Mandayam, Zhu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Building future wireless systems that support services like digital twins (DTs) is challenging to achieve through advances to conventional technologies like meta-surfaces. While artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks promise to overcome some limitations of wireless technologies, developments still rely on AI tools like neural networks. Such tools struggle to cope with the non-trivial challenges of the network environment and the growing demands of emerging use cases. In this paper, we revisit the concept of AI-native wireless systems, equipping them with the common sense necessary to transform them into artificial general intelligence (AGI)-native systems. These systems acquire common sense by exploiting different cognitive abilities such as perception, analogy, and reasoning, that enable them to generalize and deal with unforeseen scenarios. Towards developing the components of such a system, we start by showing how the perception module can be built through abstracting real-world elements into generalizable representations. These representations are then used to create a world model, founded on principles of causality and hyper-dimensional (HD) computing, that aligns with intuitive physics and enables analogical reasoning, that define common sense. Then, we explain how methods such as integrated information theory play a role in the proposed intent-driven and objective-driven planning methods that maneuver the AGI-native network to take actions. Next, we discuss how an AGI-native network can enable use cases related to human and autonomous agents: a) analogical reasoning for next-generation DTs, b) synchronized and resilient experiences for cognitive avatars, and c) brain-level metaverse experiences like holographic teleportation. Finally, we conclude with a set of recommendations to build AGI-native systems. Ultimately, we envision this paper as a roadmap for the beyond 6G era.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02370">Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial Consciousness</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwaar Ulhaq</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), which suggests that specific neural activities are linked to conscious experiences, has gained widespread acceptance. This acceptance is based on a wealth of evidence from experimental studies, brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG, and theoretical frameworks like integrated information theory (IIT) within neuroscience and the philosophy of mind. This paper explores the potential for artificial consciousness by merging neuromorphic design and architecture with brain simulations. It proposes the Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial Consciousness (NCAC) as a theoretical framework. While the debate on artificial consciousness remains contentious due to our incomplete grasp of consciousness, this work may raise eyebrows and invite criticism. Nevertheless, this optimistic and forward-thinking approach is fueled by insights from the Human Brain Project, advancements in brain imaging like EEG and fMRI, and recent strides in AI and computing, including quantum and neuromorphic designs. Additionally, this paper outlines how machine learning can play a role in crafting artificial consciousness, aiming to realise machine consciousness and awareness in the future.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02458">Controlled Query Evaluation through Epistemic Dependencies</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca Cima, Domenico Lembo, Lorenzo Marconi, Riccardo Rosati, Domenico Fabio Savo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of epistemic dependencies to express data protection policies in Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE), which is a form of confidentiality-preserving query answering over ontologies and databases. The resulting policy language goes significantly beyond those proposed in the literature on CQE so far, allowing for very rich and practically interesting forms of data protection rules. We show the expressive abilities of our framework and study the data complexity of CQE for (unions of) conjunctive queries when ontologies are specified in the Description Logic DL-Lite_R. Interestingly, while we show that the problem is in general intractable, we prove tractability for the case of acyclic epistemic dependencies by providing a suitable query rewriting algorithm. The latter result paves the way towards the implementation and practical application of this new approach to CQE.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02463">Knowledge Graph Extension by Entity Type Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daqian Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as a sophisticated advancement and refinement of semantic networks, and their deployment is one of the critical methodologies in contemporary artificial intelligence. The construction of knowledge graphs is a multifaceted process involving various techniques, where researchers aim to extract the knowledge from existing resources for the construction since building from scratch entails significant labor and time costs. However, due to the pervasive issue of heterogeneity, the description diversity across different knowledge graphs can lead to mismatches between concepts, thereby impacting the efficacy of knowledge extraction. This Ph.D. study focuses on automatic knowledge graph extension, i.e., properly extending the reference knowledge graph by extracting and integrating concepts from one or more candidate knowledge graphs. We propose a novel knowledge graph extension framework based on entity type recognition. The framework aims to achieve high-quality knowledge extraction by aligning the schemas and entities across different knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of the extension. This paper elucidates three major contributions: (i) we propose an entity type recognition method exploiting machine learning and property-based similarities to enhance knowledge extraction; (ii) we introduce a set of assessment metrics to validate the quality of the extended knowledge graphs; (iii) we develop a platform for knowledge graph acquisition, management, and extension to benefit knowledge engineers practically. Our evaluation comprehensively demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed extension framework and its functionalities through quantitative experiments and case studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangqi Kong, Yang Xing, Antonios Tsourdos, Ziyue Wang, Weisi Guo, Adolfo Perrusquia, Andreas Wikander</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, large-scale foundation models are being increasingly integrated into numerous safety-critical applications, including human-autonomy teaming (HAT) within transportation, medical, and defence domains. Consequently, the inherent 'black-box' nature of these sophisticated deep neural networks heightens the significance of fostering mutual understanding and trust between humans and autonomous systems. To tackle the transparency challenges in HAT, this paper conducts a thoughtful study on the underexplored domain of Explainable Interface (EI) in HAT systems from a human-centric perspective, thereby enriching the existing body of research in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). We explore the design, development, and evaluation of EI within XAI-enhanced HAT systems. To do so, we first clarify the distinctions between these concepts: EI, explanations and model explainability, aiming to provide researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding. Second, we contribute to a novel framework for EI, addressing the unique challenges in HAT. Last, our summarized evaluation framework for ongoing EI offers a holistic perspective, encompassing model performance, human-centered factors, and group task objectives. Based on extensive surveys across XAI, HAT, psychology, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), this review offers multiple novel insights into incorporating XAI into HAT systems and outlines future directions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02653">Isopignistic Canonical Decomposition via Belief Evolution Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Zhou, Tianxiang Zhan, Yong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing a general information processing model in uncertain environments is fundamental for the advancement of explainable artificial intelligence. Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is a well-known and effective reasoning method for representing epistemic uncertainty, which is closely related to subjective probability theory and possibility theory. Although they can be transformed to each other under some particular belief structures, there remains a lack of a clear and interpretable transformation process, as well as a unified approach for information processing. In this paper, we aim to address these issues from the perspectives of isopignistic belief functions and the hyper-cautious transferable belief model. Firstly, we propose an isopignistic transformation based on the belief evolution network. This transformation allows for the adjustment of the information granule while retaining the potential decision outcome. The isopignistic transformation is integrated with a hyper-cautious transferable belief model to establish a new canonical decomposition. This decomposition offers a reverse path between the possibility distribution and its isopignistic mass functions. The result of the canonical decomposition, called isopignistic function, is an identical information content distribution to reflect the propensity and relative commitment degree of the BPA. Furthermore, this paper introduces a method to reconstruct the basic belief assignment by adjusting the isopignistic function. It explores the advantages of this approach in modeling and handling uncertainty within the hyper-cautious transferable belief model. More general, this paper establishes a theoretical basis for building general models of artificial intelligence based on probability theory, Dempster-Shafer theory, and possibility theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Mengjia Wu, Guangquan Zhang, Jie Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Shifting the focus from principles to practical implementation, responsible artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered considerable attention across academia, industry, and society at large. Despite being in its nascent stages, this emerging field grapples with nebulous concepts and intricate knowledge frameworks. By analyzing three prevailing concepts - explainable AI, trustworthy AI, and ethical AI, this study defined responsible AI and identified its core principles. Methodologically, this study successfully demonstrated the implementation of leveraging AI's capabilities into bibliometrics for enhanced knowledge discovery and the cross-validation of experimentally examined models with domain insights. Empirically, this study investigated 17,799 research articles contributed by the AI community since 2015. This involves recognizing key technological players and their relationships, unveiling the topical landscape and hierarchy of responsible AI, charting its evolution, and elucidating the interplay between the responsibility principles and primary AI techniques. An analysis of a core cohort comprising 380 articles from multiple disciplines captures the most recent advancements in responsible AI. As one of the pioneering bibliometric studies dedicated to exploring responsible AI, this study will provide comprehensive macro-level insights, enhancing the understanding of responsible AI while furnishing valuable knowledge support for AI regulation and governance initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkai Li, Siyu Wang, Meng Zhang, Weitao Li, Yunghwei Lai, Xinhui Kang, Weizhi Ma, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital that simulates the entire process of treating illness. All patients, nurses, and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixing Lei, Zhenyang Ni, Ruize Han, Shuo Tang, Chen Feng, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A consistent spatial-temporal coordination across multiple agents is fundamental for collaborative perception, which seeks to improve perception abilities through information exchange among agents. To achieve this spatial-temporal alignment, traditional methods depend on external devices to provide localization and clock signals. However, hardware-generated signals could be vulnerable to noise and potentially malicious attack, jeopardizing the precision of spatial-temporal alignment. Rather than relying on external hardwares, this work proposes a novel approach: aligning by recognizing the inherent geometric patterns within the perceptual data of various agents. Following this spirit, we propose a robust collaborative perception system that operates independently of external localization and clock devices. The key module of our system,~\emph{FreeAlign}, constructs a salient object graph for each agent based on its detected boxes and uses a graph neural network to identify common subgraphs between agents, leading to accurate relative pose and time. We validate \emph{FreeAlign} on both real-world and simulated datasets. The results show that, the ~\emph{FreeAlign} empowered robust collaborative perception system perform comparably to systems relying on precise localization and clock devices.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03010">High Order Reasoning for Time Critical Recommendation in Evidence-based Medicine</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Manjiang Yu, Xue Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In time-critical decisions, human decision-makers can interact with AI-enabled situation-aware software to evaluate many imminent and possible scenarios, retrieve billions of facts, and estimate different outcomes based on trillions of parameters in a fraction of a second. In high-order reasoning, "what-if" questions can be used to challenge the assumptions or pre-conditions of the reasoning, "why-not" questions can be used to challenge on the method applied in the reasoning, "so-what" questions can be used to challenge the purpose of the decision, and "how-about" questions can be used to challenge the applicability of the method. When above high-order reasoning questions are applied to assist human decision-making, it can help humans to make time-critical decisions and avoid false-negative or false-positive types of errors. In this paper, we present a model of high-order reasoning to offer recommendations in evidence-based medicine in a time-critical fashion for the applications in ICU. The Large Language Model (LLM) is used in our system. The experiments demonstrated the LLM exhibited optimal performance in the "What-if" scenario, achieving a similarity of 88.52% with the treatment plans of human doctors. In the "Why-not" scenario, the best-performing model tended to opt for alternative treatment plans in 70% of cases for patients who died after being discharged from the ICU. In the "So-what" scenario, the optimal model provided a detailed analysis of the motivation and significance of treatment plans for ICU patients, with its reasoning achieving a similarity of 55.6% with actual diagnostic information. In the "How-about" scenario, the top-performing LLM demonstrated a content similarity of 66.5% in designing treatment plans transferring for similar diseases. Meanwhile, LLMs managed to predict the life status of patients after their discharge from the ICU with an accuracy of 70%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03305">Artificial Intelligence in the Autonomous Navigation of Endovascular Interventions: A Systematic Review</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Robertshaw, Lennart Karstensen, Benjamin Jackson, Hadi Sadati, Kawal Rhode, Sebastien Ourselin, Alejandro Granados, Thomas C Booth</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Autonomous navigation of devices in endovascular interventions can decrease operation times, improve decision-making during surgery, and reduce operator radiation exposure while increasing access to treatment. This systematic review explores recent literature to assess the impact, challenges, and opportunities artificial intelligence (AI) has for the autonomous endovascular intervention navigation.
  Methods: PubMed and IEEEXplore databases were queried. Eligibility criteria included studies investigating the use of AI in enabling the autonomous navigation of catheters/guidewires in endovascular interventions. Following PRISMA, articles were assessed using QUADAS-2. PROSPERO: CRD42023392259.
  Results: Among 462 studies, fourteen met inclusion criteria. Reinforcement learning (9/14, 64%) and learning from demonstration (7/14, 50%) were used as data-driven models for autonomous navigation. Studies predominantly utilised physical phantoms (10/14, 71%) and in silico (4/14, 29%) models. Experiments within or around the blood vessels of the heart were reported by the majority of studies (10/14, 71%), while simple non-anatomical vessel platforms were used in three studies (3/14, 21%), and the porcine liver venous system in one study. We observed that risk of bias and poor generalisability were present across studies. No procedures were performed on patients in any of the studies reviewed. Studies lacked patient selection criteria, reference standards, and reproducibility, resulting in low clinical evidence levels.
  Conclusions: AI's potential in autonomous endovascular navigation is promising, but in an experimental proof-of-concept stage, with a technology readiness level of 3. We highlight that reference standards with well-identified performance metrics are crucial to allow for comparisons of data-driven algorithms proposed in the years to come.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the concept of functional equivalence within the framework of the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), specifically through OpenNARS for Applications (ONA). Functional equivalence allows organisms to categorize and respond to varied stimuli based on their utility rather than perceptual similarity, thus enhancing cognitive efficiency and adaptability. In this study, ONA was modified to allow the derivation of functional equivalence. This paper provides practical examples of the capability of ONA to apply learned knowledge across different functional situations, demonstrating its utility in complex problem-solving and decision-making. An extended example is included, where training of ONA aimed to learn basic human-like language abilities, using a systematic procedure in relating spoken words, objects and written words. The research carried out as part of this study extends the understanding of functional equivalence in AGI systems, and argues for its necessity for level of flexibility in learning and adapting necessary for human-level AGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Luttermann, Edgar Baake, Juljan Bouchagiar, Benjamin Gebel, Philipp Gr\"uning, Dilini Manikwadura, Franziska Schollemann, Elisa Teifke, Philipp Rostalski, Ralf M\"oller</p>
<p>Abstract: Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a systematic approach to identify and analyse potential failures and their effects in a system or process. The FMEA approach, however, requires domain experts to manually analyse the FMEA model to derive risk-reducing actions that should be applied. In this paper, we provide a formal framework to allow for automatic planning and acting in FMEA models. More specifically, we cast the FMEA model into a Markov decision process which can then be solved by existing solvers. We show that the FMEA approach can not only be used to support medical experts during the modelling process but also to automatically derive optimal therapies for the treatment of patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenzhe Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through deep neural networks, has catalyzed significant progress in fields such as vision and text processing. Nonetheless, the pursuit of AI systems that exhibit human-like reasoning and interpretability continues to pose a substantial challenge. The Neural-Symbolic paradigm, which integrates the deep learning prowess of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of symbolic systems, presents a promising pathway toward developing more transparent and comprehensible AI systems. Within this paradigm, the Knowledge Graph (KG) emerges as a crucial element, offering a structured and dynamic method for representing knowledge through interconnected entities and relationships, predominantly utilizing the triple (subject, predicate, object). This paper explores recent advancements in neural-symbolic integration based on KG, elucidating how KG underpins this integration across three key categories: enhancing the reasoning and interpretability of neural networks through the incorporation of symbolic knowledge (Symbol for Neural), refining the completeness and accuracy of symbolic systems via neural network methodologies (Neural for Symbol), and facilitating their combined application in Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Integration. It highlights current trends and proposes directions for future research in the domain of Neural-Symbolic AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paramanand Chandramouli, Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota</p>
<p>Abstract: Research in vision-language models has seen rapid developments off-late, enabling natural language-based interfaces for image generation and manipulation. Many existing text guided manipulation techniques are restricted to specific classes of images, and often require fine-tuning to transfer to a different style or domain. Nevertheless, generic image manipulation using a single model with flexible text inputs is highly desirable. Recent work addresses this task by guiding generative models trained on the generic image datasets using pretrained vision-language encoders. While promising, this approach requires expensive optimization for each input. In this work, we propose an optimization-free method for the task of generic image manipulation from text prompts. Our approach exploits recent Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) for text to image generation to achieve zero-shot text guided manipulation. We employ a deterministic forward diffusion in a lower dimensional latent space, and the desired manipulation is achieved by simply providing the target text to condition the reverse diffusion process. We refer to our approach as LDEdit. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on semantic image manipulation and artistic style transfer. Our method can accomplish image manipulation on diverse domains and enables editing multiple attributes in a straightforward fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefit of our approach over competing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhua Wu, Bingzhao Gao, Jincheng Gao, Jianhao Yu, Hongqing Chu, Qiankun Yu, Xun Gong, Yi Chang, H. Eric Tseng, Hong Chen, Jie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence and breakthroughs in deep learning, large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), such as GPT, CLIP, etc., have achieved remarkable results in many fields including natural language processing and computer vision. The application of FMs in autonomous driving holds considerable promise. For example, they can contribute to enhance scene understanding and reasoning. By pre-training on rich linguistic and visual data, FMs can understand and interpret various elements in a driving scene, and provide cognitive reasoning to give linguistic and action commands for driving decisions and planning. Furthermore, FMs can augment data based on its understanding of driving scenarios to provide feasible scenes of those rare occurrences in the long tail distribution that are unlikely to be encountered during routine driving and data collection. The enhancement can subsequently lead to the improvement in the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Another testament to the potential of FMs applications lies in the development of World Models, exemplified by the DREAMER series, which showcase the ability to comprehend physical laws and dynamics. Learning from massive data under the paradigm of self-supervised learning, World Model can generate unseen yet plausible driving environment, facilitating the enhancement in the prediction of road users behavior and the off-line training of driving strategies. In this paper, we synthesize the applications and future trends of FMs in autonomous driving. By utilizing the powerful capabilities of FMs, we strive to tackle the potential issues stemming from the long-tail distribution in autonomous driving, consequently advancing overall safety in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannis Tevissen (ARMEDIA-SAMOVAR, ML), Khalil Guetari, Marine Tassel, Erwan Kerleroux, Fr\'ed\'eric Petitpont</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning models are widely used to describe recent and archived pictures with the objective of improving their accessibility and retrieval. Yet, these approaches tend to be inefficient and biased at retrieving people's names. In this work we introduce AstroCaptions, a dataset for the image captioning task. This dataset specifically contains thousands of public fig-ures that are complex to identify for a traditional model. We also propose a novel post-processing method to insert identified people's names inside the caption using explainable AI tools and the grounding capabilities of vi-sion-language models. The results obtained with this method show signifi-cant improvements of captions quality and a potential of reducing halluci-nations. Up to 93.2% of the persons detected can be inserted in the image captions leading to improvements in the BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr and METEOR scores of each captioning model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Ahmadvand, Sarah Safura Sharif, Yaser Mike Banad</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel cloud-edge framework for addressing computational and energy constraints in complex control systems. Our approach centers around a learning-based controller using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) on physical plants. By integrating a biologically plausible learning method with local plasticity rules, we harness the efficiency, scalability, and low latency of SNNs. This design replicates control signals from a cloud-based controller directly on the plant, reducing the need for constant plant-cloud communication. The plant updates weights only when errors surpass predefined thresholds, ensuring efficiency and robustness in various conditions. Applied to linear workbench systems and satellite rendezvous scenarios, including obstacle avoidance, our architecture dramatically lowers normalized tracking error by 96% with increased network size. The event-driven nature of SNNs minimizes energy consumption, utilizing only about 111 nJ (0.3% of conventional computing requirements). The results demonstrate the system's adjustment to changing work environments and its efficient use of computational and energy resources, with a moderate increase in energy consumption of 27.2% and 37% for static and dynamic obstacles, respectively, compared to non-obstacle scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Lalwani, Lovish Chopra, Christopher Hahn, Caroline Trippel, Zhijing Jin, Mrinmaya Sachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical fallacies are common errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument. Automatically detecting logical fallacies has important applications in tracking misinformation and validating claims. In this paper, we design a process to reliably detect logical fallacies by translating natural language to First-order Logic (FOL) step-by-step using Large Language Models (LLMs). We then utilize Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to reason about the validity of the formula and classify inputs as either a fallacy or valid statement. Our model also provides a novel means of utilizing LLMs to interpret the output of the SMT solver, offering insights into the counter-examples that illustrate why a given sentence is considered a logical fallacy. Our approach is robust, interpretable and does not require training data or fine-tuning. We evaluate our model on a mixed dataset of fallacies and valid sentences. The results demonstrate improved performance compared to end-to-end LLMs, with our classifier achieving an F1-score of 71\% on the Logic dataset. The approach is able to generalize effectively, achieving an F1-score of 73% on the challenge set, LogicClimate, outperforming state-of-the-art models by 21% despite its much smaller size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Sun, Erwu Liu, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of wireless communication will directly affect the performance of federated learning (FL), so this paper analyze the influence of wireless communication on FL through symbol error rate (SER). In FL system, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can be used as the basic communication framework to reduce the communication congestion and interference caused by multiple users, which takes advantage of the superposition characteristics of wireless channels. The Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) based serial interference cancellation (SIC) technology is used to recover the gradient of each terminal node one by one at the receiving end. In this paper, the gradient parameters are quantized into multiple bits to retain more gradient information to the maximum extent and to improve the tolerance of transmission errors. On this basis, we designed the SER-based device selection mechanism (SER-DSM) to ensure that the learning performance is not affected by users with bad communication conditions, while accommodating as many users as possible to participate in the learning process, which is inclusive to a certain extent. The experiments show the influence of multi-bit quantization of gradient on FL and the necessity and superiority of the proposed SER-based device selection mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities for producing code in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). However, most of the focus remains on their abilities to write functional code, not test code. The hardware design process consists of both design and test, and so eschewing validation and verification leaves considerable potential benefit unexplored, given that a design and test framework may allow for progress towards full automation of the digital design pipeline. In this work, we perform one of the first studies exploring how a LLM can both design and test hardware modules from provided specifications. Using a suite of 8 representative benchmarks, we examined the capabilities and limitations of the state-of-the-art conversational LLMs when producing Verilog for functional and verification purposes. We taped out the benchmarks on a Skywater 130nm shuttle and received the functional chip.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02329">Digital ASIC Design with Ongoing LLMs: Strategies and Prospects</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maoyang Xiang, Emil Goh, T. Hui Teo</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern digital systems has imposed significant challenges on integrated circuit (IC) design, necessitating tools that can simplify the IC design flow. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been seen as a promising development, with the potential to automate the generation of Hardware Description Language (HDL) code, thereby streamlining digital IC design. However, the practical application of LLMs in this area faces substantial hurdles. Notably, current LLMs often generate HDL code with small but critical syntax errors and struggle to accurately convey the high-level semantics of circuit designs. These issues significantly undermine the utility of LLMs for IC design, leading to misinterpretations and inefficiencies.
  In response to these challenges, this paper presents targeted strategies to harness the capabilities of LLMs for digital ASIC design. We outline approaches that improve the reliability and accuracy of HDL code generation by LLMs. As a practical demonstration of these strategies, we detail the development of a simple three-phase Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator. This project, part of the "Efabless AI-Generated Open-Source Chip Design Challenge," successfully passed the Design Rule Check (DRC) and was fabricated, showcasing the potential of LLMs to enhance digital ASIC design. This work underscores the feasibility and benefits of integrating LLMs into the IC design process, offering a novel approach to overcoming the complexities of modern digital systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessio Devoto, Simone Petruzzi, Jary Pomponi, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Simone Scardapane</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel design for AI-native goal-oriented communications, exploiting transformer neural networks under dynamic inference constraints on bandwidth and computation. Transformers have become the standard architecture for pretraining large-scale vision and text models, and preliminary results have shown promising performance also in deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC). Here, we consider a dynamic model where communication happens over a channel with variable latency and bandwidth constraints. Leveraging recent works on conditional computation, we exploit the structure of the transformer blocks and the multihead attention operator to design a trainable semantic token selection mechanism that learns to select relevant tokens (e.g., image patches) from the input signal. This is done dynamically, on a per-input basis, with a rate that can be chosen as an additional input by the user. We show that our model improves over state-of-the-art token selection mechanisms, exhibiting high accuracy for a wide range of latency and bandwidth constraints, without the need for deploying multiple architectures tailored to each constraint. Last, but not least, the proposed token selection mechanism helps extract powerful semantics that are easy to understand and explain, paving the way for interpretable-by-design models for the next generation of AI-native communication systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrien Le Coz, Houssem Ouertatani, St\'ephane Herbin, Faouzi Adjed</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classifiers should be used with caution in the real world. Performance evaluated on a validation set may not reflect performance in the real world. In particular, classifiers may perform well for conditions that are frequently encountered during training, but poorly for other infrequent conditions. In this study, we hypothesize that recent advances in text-to-image generative models make them valuable for benchmarking computer vision models such as image classifiers: they can generate images conditioned by textual prompts that cause classifier failures, allowing failure conditions to be described with textual attributes. However, their generation cost becomes an issue when a large number of synthetic images need to be generated, which is the case when many different attribute combinations need to be tested. We propose an image classifier benchmarking method as an iterative process that alternates image generation, classifier evaluation, and attribute selection. This method efficiently explores the attributes that ultimately lead to poor behavior detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Prinzi, Carmelo Militello, Calogero Zarcaro, Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta, Salvatore Gaglio, Salvatore Vitabile</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last years, artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical decision support systems (CDSS) played a key role in harnessing machine learning and deep learning architectures. Despite their promising capabilities, the lack of transparency and explainability of AI models poses significant challenges, particularly in medical contexts where reliability is a mandatory aspect. Achieving transparency without compromising predictive accuracy remains a key challenge. This paper presents a novel method, namely Rad4XCNN, to enhance the predictive power of CNN-derived features with the interpretability inherent in radiomic features. Rad4XCNN diverges from conventional methods based on saliency map, by associating intelligible meaning to CNN-derived features by means of Radiomics, offering new perspectives on explanation methods beyond visualization maps. Using a breast cancer classification task as a case study, we evaluated Rad4XCNN on ultrasound imaging datasets, including an online dataset and two in-house datasets for internal and external validation. Some key results are: i) CNN-derived features guarantee more robust accuracy when compared against ViT-derived and radiomic features; ii) conventional visualization map methods for explanation present several pitfalls; iii) Rad4XCNN does not sacrifice model accuracy for their explainability; iv) Rad4XCNN provides global explanation insights enabling the physician to analyze the model outputs and findings. In addition, we highlight the importance of integrating interpretability into AI models for enhanced trust and adoption in clinical practice, emphasizing how our method can mitigate some concerns related to explainable AI methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyu Yang, Naveed Akhtar, Jiantong Jiang, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Attribution methods compute importance scores for input features to explain the output predictions of deep models. However, accurate assessment of attribution methods is challenged by the lack of benchmark fidelity for attributing model predictions. Moreover, other confounding factors in attribution estimation, including the setup choices of post-processing techniques and explained model predictions, further compromise the reliability of the evaluation. In this work, we first identify a set of fidelity criteria that reliable benchmarks for attribution methods are expected to fulfill, thereby facilitating a systematic assessment of attribution benchmarks. Next, we introduce a Backdoor-based eXplainable AI benchmark (BackX) that adheres to the desired fidelity criteria. We theoretically establish the superiority of our approach over the existing benchmarks for well-founded attribution evaluation. With extensive analysis, we also identify a setup for a consistent and fair benchmarking of attribution methods across different underlying methodologies. This setup is ultimately employed for a comprehensive comparison of existing methods using our BackX benchmark. Finally, our analysis also provides guidance for defending against backdoor attacks with the help of attribution methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Ma, Daniele Grandi, Christopher McComb, Kosa Goucher-Lambert</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to large amounts of diverse design solutions can support designers during the early stage of the design process. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of large language models (LLM) in producing diverse design solutions, investigating the level of impact that parameter tuning and various prompt engineering techniques can have on the diversity of LLM-generated design solutions. Specifically, LLMs are used to generate a total of 4,000 design solutions across five distinct design topics, eight combinations of parameters, and eight different types of prompt engineering techniques, comparing each combination of parameter and prompt engineering method across four different diversity metrics. LLM-generated solutions are compared against 100 human-crowdsourced solutions in each design topic using the same set of diversity metrics. Results indicate that human-generated solutions consistently have greater diversity scores across all design topics. Using a post hoc logistic regression analysis we investigate whether these differences primarily exist at the semantic level. Results show that there is a divide in some design topics between humans and LLM-generated solutions, while others have no clear divide. Taken together, these results contribute to the understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating a large volume of diverse design solutions and offer insights for future research that leverages LLMs to generate diverse design solutions for a broad range of design tasks (e.g., inspirational stimuli).</p>

<p>Abstract: Adapting pre-trained large language models to different domains in natural language processing requires two key considerations: high computational demands and model's inability to continual adaptation. To simultaneously address both issues, this paper presents COPAL (COntinual Pruning in Adaptive Language settings), an algorithm developed for pruning large language generative models under a continual model adaptation setting. While avoiding resource-heavy finetuning or retraining, our pruning process is guided by the proposed sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity effectively measures model's ability to withstand perturbations introduced by the new dataset and finds model's weights that are relevant for all encountered datasets. As a result, COPAL allows seamless model adaptation to new domains while enhancing the resource efficiency. Our empirical evaluation on a various size of LLMs show that COPAL outperforms baseline models, demonstrating its efficacy in efficiency and adaptability.</p>

These benchmarks often highlight failures of existing models, but it is not clear why these models fail in this way. In this paper, we seek to theoretically understand the role the compositional structure of the models plays in these failures and how this structure relates to their expressivity and sample complexity. We propose a general neuro-symbolic definition of compositional functions and their compositional complexity. We then show how various existing general and special purpose sequence processing models (such as recurrent, convolution and attention-based ones) fit this definition and use it to analyze their compositional complexity. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the expressivity and systematic generalization of compositional models that explicitly depend on our proposed definition and highlighting factors which drive poor empirical performance.</p>

We propose Specialized Neural Accelerator-Powered Domain Decomposition Methods (SNAP-DDM), a DDM-based approach to PDE solving in which subdomain problems containing arbitrary boundary conditions and geometric parameters are accurately solved using an ensemble of specialized neural operators. We tailor SNAP-DDM to 2D electromagnetics and fluidic flow problems and show how innovations in network architecture and loss function engineering can produce specialized surrogate subdomain solvers with near unity accuracy. We utilize these solvers with standard DDM algorithms to accurately solve freeform electromagnetics and fluids problems featuring a wide range of domain sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Xing Liu, Wen-Yu Xi, Ling-Yun Dai, Chun-Hou Zheng, Ying-Lian Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The emerging research shows that lncRNAs are associated with a series of complex human diseases. However, most of the existing methods have limitations in identifying nonlinear lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs), and it remains a huge challenge to predict new LDAs. Therefore, the accurate identification of LDAs is very important for the warning and treatment of diseases. In this work, multiple sources of biomedical data are fully utilized to construct characteristics of lncRNAs and diseases, and linear and nonlinear characteristics are effectively integrated. Furthermore, a novel deep learning model based on graph attention automatic encoder is proposed, called HGATELDA. To begin with, the linear characteristics of lncRNAs and diseases are created by the miRNA-lncRNA interaction matrix and miRNA-disease interaction matrix. Following this, the nonlinear features of diseases and lncRNAs are extracted using a graph attention auto-encoder, which largely retains the critical information and effectively aggregates the neighborhood information of nodes. In the end, LDAs can be predicted by fusing the linear and nonlinear characteristics of diseases and lncRNA. The HGATELDA model achieves an impressive AUC value of 0.9692 when evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation indicating its superior performance in comparison to several recent prediction models. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of HGATELDA in identifying novel LDAs is further demonstrated by case studies. the HGATELDA model appears to be a viable computational model for predicting LDAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kounianhua Du, Renting Rui, Huacan Chai, Lingyue Fu, Wei Xia, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In addition, programming languages are inherently logical and complex, making them hard to be correctly generated. Existing methods rely on multiple prompts to the large language model to explore better solutions, which is expensive. In this paper, we propose Syntax Graph Retrieval Augmented Code Generation (CodeGRAG) to enhance the performance of LLMs in single-round code generation tasks. CodeGRAG extracts and summarizes the control flow and data flow of code blocks to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language. The extracted external structural knowledge models the inherent flows of code blocks, which can facilitate LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation, e.g., C++ for Python.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xincheng Feng, Guodong Shen, Jianhao Hu, Meng Li, Ngai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonlinearities are crucial for capturing complex input-output relationships especially in deep neural networks. However, nonlinear functions often incur various hardware and compute overheads. Meanwhile, stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as a promising approach to tackle this challenge by trading output precision for hardware simplicity. To this end, this paper proposes a first-of-its-kind stochastic multivariate universal-radix finite-state machine (SMURF) that harnesses SC for hardware-simplistic multivariate nonlinear function generation at high accuracy. We present the finite-state machine (FSM) architecture for SMURF, as well as analytical derivations of sampling gate coefficients for accurately approximating generic nonlinear functions. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of SMURF, requiring only 16.07% area and 14.45% power consumption of Taylor-series approximation, and merely 2.22% area of look-up table (LUT) schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexia Ye, Weiqi Zhang, Ke Yi, Yongzi Yu, Ziyue Li, Jia Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data are ubiquitous across various domains, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely \textbf{pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series} and \textbf{adapting large language foundation models for time series}. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis. This survey offers a 3E analytical framework for comprehensive examination of related research. Specifically, we examine existing works from three dimensions, namely \textbf{Effectiveness}, \textbf{Efficiency} and \textbf{Explainability}. In each dimension, we focus on discussing how related works devise tailored solution by considering unique challenges in the realm of time series.Furthermore, we provide a domain taxonomy to help followers keep up with the domain-specific advancements. In addition, we introduce extensive resources to facilitate the field's development, including datasets, open-source, time series libraries.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jindong Li, Qianli Xing, Qi Wang, Yi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has received remarkable performance in various critical disciplines, such as chemistry analysis and bioinformatics. Existing UGAD paradigms often adopt data augmentation techniques to construct multiple views, and then employ different strategies to obtain representations from different views for jointly conducting UGAD. However, most previous works only considered the relationship between nodes/graphs from a limited receptive field, resulting in some key structure patterns and feature information being neglected. In addition, most existing methods consider different views separately in a parallel manner, which is not able to explore the inter-relationship across different views directly. Thus, a method with a larger receptive field that can explore the inter-relationship across different views directly is in need. In this paper, we propose a novel Simplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for Unsupervised Graph-level Anomaly Detection, namely, CVTGAD. To increase the receptive field, we construct a simplified transformer-based module, exploiting the relationship between nodes/graphs from both intra-graph and inter-graph perspectives. Furthermore, we design a cross-view attention mechanism to directly exploit the view co-occurrence between different views, bridging the inter-view gap at node level and graph level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply transformer and cross attention to UGAD, which realizes graph neural network and transformer working collaboratively. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets of 3 fields demonstrate the superiority of CVTGAD on the UGAD task. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/jindongli-Ai/CVTGAD}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng-Lei Fan, Meng Wang, Hang-Cheng Dong, Jianwei Ma, Tieyong Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Biologically, the brain does not rely on a single type of neuron that universally functions in all aspects. Instead, it acts as a sophisticated designer of task-based neurons. In this study, we address the following question: since the human brain is a task-based neuron user, can the artificial network design go from the task-based architecture design to the task-based neuron design? Since methodologically there are no one-size-fits-all neurons, given the same structure, task-based neurons can enhance the feature representation ability relative to the existing universal neurons due to the intrinsic inductive bias for the task. Specifically, we propose a two-step framework for prototyping task-based neurons. First, symbolic regression is used to identify optimal formulas that fit input data by utilizing base functions such as logarithmic, trigonometric, and exponential functions. We introduce vectorized symbolic regression that stacks all variables in a vector and regularizes each input variable to perform the same computation, which can expedite the regression speed, facilitate parallel computation, and avoid overfitting. Second, we parameterize the acquired elementary formula to make parameters learnable, which serves as the aggregation function of the neuron. The activation functions such as ReLU and the sigmoidal functions remain the same because they have proven to be good. Empirically, experimental results on synthetic data, classic benchmarks, and real-world applications show that the proposed task-based neuron design is not only feasible but also delivers competitive performance over other state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Puente Varona</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to Machine Learning (ML) that focuses on unsupervised continuous context-dependent learning of complex patterns. Although the proposal is partly inspired by some of the current knowledge about the structural and functional properties of the mammalian brain, we do not claim that biological systems work in an analogous way (nor the opposite). Based on some properties of the cerebellar cortex and adjacent structures, a proposal suitable for practical problems is presented. A synthetic structure capable of identifying and predicting complex temporal series will be defined and experimentally tested. The system relies heavily on prediction to help identify and learn patterns based on previously acquired contextual knowledge. As a proof of concept, the proposed system is shown to be able to learn, identify and predict a remarkably complex temporal series such as human speech, with no prior knowledge. From raw data, without any adaptation in the core algorithm, the system is able to identify certain speech structures from a set of Spanish sentences. Unlike conventional ML, the proposal can learn with a reduced training set. Although the idea can be applied to a constrained problem, such as the detection of unknown vocabulary in a speech, it could be used in more applications, such as vision, or (by incorporating the missing biological periphery) fit into other ML techniques. Given the trivial computational primitives used, a potential hardware implementation will be remarkably frugal. Coincidentally, the proposed model not only conforms to a plausible functional framework for biological systems but may also explain many elusive cognitive phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yancheng Huang, Kai Yang, Zelin Zhu, Leian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary goal of online change detection (OCD) is to promptly identify changes in the data stream. OCD problem find a wide variety of applications in diverse areas, e.g., security detection in smart grids and intrusion detection in communication networks. Prior research usually assumes precise knowledge of the parameters linked to the data stream. Nevertheless, this presumption often proves unattainable in practical scenarios due to factors such as estimation errors, system updates, etc. This paper aims to take the first attempt to develop a triadic-OCD framework with certifiable robustness, provable optimality, and guaranteed convergence. In addition, the proposed triadic-OCD algorithm can be realized in a fully asynchronous distributed manner, easing the necessity of transmitting the data to a single server. This asynchronous mechanism also could mitigate the straggler issue that faced by traditional synchronous algorithm. We then analyze the non-asymptotic convergence property of triadic-OCD and derive its iteration complexity to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal point. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arturo Fiorellini-Bernardis, Sebastien Boyer, Christoph Brunken, Bakary Diallo, Karim Beguir, Nicolas Lopez-Carranza, Oliver Bent</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in numerous biological processes. Developing methods that predict binding affinity changes under substitution mutations is fundamental for modelling and re-engineering biological systems. Deep learning is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool capable of bridging the gap between in-silico predictions and in-vitro observations. With this contribution, we propose eGRAL, a novel SE(3) equivariant graph neural network (eGNN) architecture designed for predicting binding affinity changes from multiple amino acid substitutions in protein complexes. eGRAL leverages residue, atomic and evolutionary scales, thanks to features extracted from protein large language models. To address the limited availability of large-scale affinity assays with structural information, we generate a simulated dataset comprising approximately 500,000 data points. Our model is pre-trained on this dataset, then fine-tuned and tested on experimental data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian {\O}stby, Tobias M. Brambo, Sondre Glimsdal</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Sparse Tsetlin Machine (STM), a novel Tsetlin Machine (TM) that processes sparse data efficiently. Traditionally, the TM does not consider data characteristics such as sparsity, commonly seen in NLP applications and other bag-of-word-based representations. Consequently, a TM must initialize, store, and process a significant number of zero values, resulting in excessive memory usage and computational time. Previous attempts at creating a sparse TM have predominantly been unsuccessful, primarily due to their inability to identify which literals are sufficient for TM training. By introducing Active Literals (AL), the STM can focus exclusively on literals that actively contribute to the current data representation, significantly decreasing memory footprint and computational time while demonstrating competitive classification performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Model Parameter Randomisation Test (MPRT) is highly recognised in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) community due to its fundamental evaluative criterion: explanations should be sensitive to the parameters of the model they seek to explain. However, recent studies have raised several methodological concerns for the empirical interpretation of MPRT. In response, we propose two modifications to the original test: Smooth MPRT and Efficient MPRT. The former reduces the impact of noise on evaluation outcomes via sampling, while the latter avoids the need for biased similarity measurements by re-interpreting the test through the increase in explanation complexity after full model randomisation. Our experiments show that these modifications enhance the metric reliability, facilitating a more trustworthy deployment of explanation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyuan Chen, Xingzhuo Guo, Yu Zhang, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) is a theoretical framework in cognitive science suggesting that the human brain processes cognition through spatiotemporal prediction of the visual world. Existing studies have developed spatiotemporal prediction neural networks based on the PC theory, emulating its two core mechanisms: Correcting predictions from residuals and hierarchical learning. However, these models do not show the enhancement of prediction skills on real-world forecasting tasks and ignore the Precision Weighting mechanism of PC theory. The precision weighting mechanism posits that the brain allocates more attention to signals with lower precision, contributing to the cognitive ability of human brains. This work introduces the Cognitive Diffusion Probabilistic Models (CogDPM), which demonstrate the connection between diffusion probabilistic models and PC theory. CogDPM features a precision estimation method based on the hierarchical sampling capabilities of diffusion models and weight the guidance with precision weights estimated by the inherent property of diffusion models. We experimentally show that the precision weights effectively estimate the data predictability. We apply CogDPM to real-world prediction tasks using the United Kindom precipitation and ERA surface wind datasets. Our results demonstrate that CogDPM outperforms both existing domain-specific operational models and general deep prediction models by providing more proficient forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) have emerged as an efficient framework for representing and learning complex probability distributions. Nevertheless, the existing body of research on PCs predominantly concentrates on data-driven parameter learning, often neglecting the potential of knowledge-intensive learning, a particular issue in data-scarce/knowledge-rich domains such as healthcare. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel unified framework that can systematically integrate diverse domain knowledge into the parameter learning process of PCs. Experiments on several benchmarks as well as real world datasets show that our proposed framework can both effectively and efficiently leverage domain knowledge to achieve superior performance compared to purely data-driven learning approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: We apply multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train end-to-end robot soccer policies with fully onboard computation and sensing via egocentric RGB vision. This setting reflects many challenges of real-world robotics, including active perception, agile full-body control, and long-horizon planning in a dynamic, partially-observable, multi-agent domain. We rely on large-scale, simulation-based data generation to obtain complex behaviors from egocentric vision which can be successfully transferred to physical robots using low-cost sensors. To achieve adequate visual realism, our simulation combines rigid-body physics with learned, realistic rendering via multiple Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We combine teacher-based multi-agent RL and cross-experiment data reuse to enable the discovery of sophisticated soccer strategies. We analyze active-perception behaviors including object tracking and ball seeking that emerge when simply optimizing perception-agnostic soccer play. The agents display equivalent levels of performance and agility as policies with access to privileged, ground-truth state. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes a first demonstration of end-to-end training for multi-agent robot soccer, mapping raw pixel observations to joint-level actions, that can be deployed in the real world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyiran Li, Xiang Zhai, Moustafa Alzantot, Keyi Yu, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen, Mohamed Hammad</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional recommender systems such as matrix factorization methods rely on learning a shared dense embedding space to represent both items and user preferences. Sequence models such as RNN, GRUs, and, recently, Transformers have also excelled in the task of sequential recommendation. This task requires understanding the sequential structure present in users' historical interactions to predict the next item they may like. Building upon the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a variety of tasks, researchers have recently explored using LLMs that are pretrained on vast corpora of text for sequential recommendation. To use LLMs in sequential recommendations, both the history of user interactions and the model's prediction of the next item are expressed in text form. We propose CALRec, a two-stage LLM finetuning framework that finetunes a pretrained LLM in a two-tower fashion using a mixture of two contrastive losses and a language modeling loss: the LLM is first finetuned on a data mixture from multiple domains followed by another round of target domain finetuning. Our model significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines (+37% in Recall@1 and +24% in NDCG@10) and systematic ablation studies reveal that (i) both stages of finetuning are crucial, and, when combined, we achieve improved performance, and (ii) contrastive alignment is effective among the target domains explored in our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Burnham</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in text analysis. Recent advancements with Large Language Models have made it more accurate and accessible than ever, allowing researchers to classify text with only a plain English prompt. However, "sentiment" entails a wide variety of concepts depending on the domain and tools used. It has been used to mean emotion, opinions, market movements, or simply a general ``good-bad'' dimension. This raises a question: What exactly are language models doing when prompted to label documents by sentiment? This paper first overviews how sentiment is defined across different contexts, highlighting that it is a confounded measurement construct in that it entails multiple variables, such as emotional valence and opinion, without disentangling them. I then test three language models across two data sets with prompts requesting sentiment, valence, and stance classification. I find that sentiment labels most strongly correlate with valence labels. I further find that classification improves when researchers more precisely specify their dimension of interest rather than using the less well-defined concept of sentiment. I conclude by encouraging researchers to move beyond "sentiment" when feasible and use a more precise measurement construct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R\"ugamer, Chris Kolb, Tobias Weber, Lucas Kook, Thomas Nagler</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of black-box algorithms can lead to various challenges, including the introduction of biases. These biases present immediate risks in the algorithms' application. It was, for instance, shown that neural networks can deduce racial information solely from a patient's X-ray scan, a task beyond the capability of medical experts. If this fact is not known to the medical expert, automatic decision-making based on this algorithm could lead to prescribing a treatment (purely) based on racial information. While current methodologies allow for the "orthogonalization" or "normalization" of neural networks with respect to such information, existing approaches are grounded in linear models. Our paper advances the discourse by introducing corrections for non-linearities such as ReLU activations. Our approach also encompasses scalar and tensor-valued predictions, facilitating its integration into neural network architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate our method's effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data in generalized linear models, normalizing convolutional neural networks for metadata, and rectifying pre-existing embeddings for undesired attributes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach to simulating an over-the-counter (OTC) financial market in which trades are intermediated solely by market makers and agent visibility is constrained to a network topology. Dynamics, such as changes in price, result from agent-level interactions that ubiquitously occur via market maker agents acting as liquidity providers. Two additional agents are considered: trend investors use a deep convolutional neural network paired with a deep Q-learning framework to inform trading decisions by analysing price history; and value investors use a static price-target to determine their trade directions and sizes. We demonstrate that our novel inclusion of a network topology with market makers facilitates explorations into various market structures. First, we present the model and an overview of its mechanics. Second, we validate our findings via comparison to the real-world: we demonstrate a fat-tailed distribution of price changes, auto-correlated volatility, a skew negatively correlated to market maker positioning, predictable price-history patterns and more. Finally, we demonstrate that our network-based model can lend insights into the effect of market-structure on price-action. For example, we show that markets with sparsely connected intermediaries can have a critical point of fragmentation, beyond which the market forms distinct clusters and arbitrage becomes rapidly possible between the prices of different market makers. A discussion is provided on future work that would be beneficial.</p>

<p>Abstract: Curriculum design for reinforcement learning (RL) can speed up an agent's learning process and help it learn to perform well on complex tasks. However, existing techniques typically require domain-specific hyperparameter tuning, involve expensive optimization procedures for task selection, or are suitable only for specific learning objectives. In this work, we consider curriculum design in contextual multi-task settings where the agent's final performance is measured w.r.t. a target distribution over complex tasks. We base our curriculum design on the Zone of Proximal Development concept, which has proven to be effective in accelerating the learning process of RL agents for uniform distribution over all tasks. We propose a novel curriculum, ProCuRL-Target, that effectively balances the need for selecting tasks that are not too difficult for the agent while progressing the agent's learning toward the target distribution via leveraging task correlations. We theoretically justify the task selection strategy of ProCuRL-Target by analyzing a simple learning setting with REINFORCE learner model. Our experimental results across various domains with challenging target task distributions affirm the effectiveness of our curriculum strategy over state-of-the-art baselines in accelerating the training process of deep RL agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive text corpora, which are encoded with diverse personality traits. This triggers an interesting goal of eliciting a desired personality trait from the LLM, and probing its behavioral preferences. Accordingly, we formalize the persona elicitation task, aiming to customize LLM behaviors to align with a target persona. We present Persona In-Context Learning (PICLe), a novel persona elicitation framework grounded in Bayesian inference. At the core, PICLe introduces a new ICL example selection criterion based on likelihood ratio, which is designed to optimally guide the model in eliciting a specific target persona. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PICLe through extensive comparisons against baseline methods across three contemporary LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/picle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayang Shi, Junyi Zhu, Daniel M. Pelt, K. Joost Batenburg, Matthew B. Blaschko</p>
<p>Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is pivotal in industrial quality control and medical diagnostics. Sparse-view CT, offering reduced ionizing radiation, faces challenges due to its under-sampled nature, leading to ill-posed reconstruction problems. Recent advancements in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have shown promise in addressing sparse-view CT reconstruction. Recognizing that CT often involves scanning similar subjects, we propose a novel approach to improve reconstruction quality through joint reconstruction of multiple objects using INRs. This approach can potentially leverage both the strengths of INRs and the statistical regularities across multiple objects. While current INR joint reconstruction techniques primarily focus on accelerating convergence via meta-initialization, they are not specifically tailored to enhance reconstruction quality. To address this gap, we introduce a novel INR-based Bayesian framework integrating latent variables to capture the inter-object relationships. These variables serve as a dynamic reference throughout the optimization, thereby enhancing individual reconstruction fidelity. Our extensive experiments, which assess various key factors such as reconstruction quality, resistance to overfitting, and generalizability, demonstrate significant improvements over baselines in common numerical metrics. This underscores a notable advancement in CT reconstruction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yohei Nakayama, Jiawei Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, the foundation models represented by large language models have made dramatic progress and are used in a very wide range of domains including 2D and 3D vision. As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with other geospatial foundation models on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Xu, Nhu Le, Rebekah Park, Laura Murray, Vishnupriya Das, Devika Kumar, Beth Goldberg</p>
<p>Abstract: We conducted an in-person ethnography in India and the US to investigate how young people (18-24) trusted online content, with a focus on generative AI (GenAI). We had four key findings about how young people use GenAI and determine what to trust online. First, when online, we found participants fluidly shifted between mindsets and emotional states, which we term "information modes." Second, these information modes shaped how and why participants trust GenAI and how they applied literacy skills. In the modes where they spent most of their time, they eschewed literacy skills. Third, with the advent of GenAI, participants imported existing trust heuristics from familiar online contexts into their interactions with GenAI. Fourth, although study participants had reservations about GenAI, they saw it as a requisite tool to adopt to keep up with the times. Participants valued efficiency above all else, and used GenAI to further their goals quickly at the expense of accuracy. Our findings suggest that young people spend the majority of their time online not concerned with truth because they are seeking only to pass the time. As a result, literacy interventions should be designed to intervene at the right time, to match users' distinct information modes, and to work with their existing fact-checking practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shlesh Sakpal</p>
<p>Abstract: Although space weather events may not directly affect human life, they have the potential to inflict significant harm upon our communities. Harmful space weather events can trigger atmospheric changes that result in physical and economic damages on a global scale. In 1989, Earth experienced the effects of a powerful geomagnetic storm that caused satellites to malfunction, while triggering power blackouts in Canada, along with electricity disturbances in the United States and Europe. With the solar cycle peak rapidly approaching, there is an ever-increasing need to prepare and prevent the damages that can occur, especially to modern-day technology, calling for the need of a comprehensive prediction system. This study aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict instances of space weather (solar flares, coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic storms), based on active region magnetograms of the Sun. This was done through the use of the NASA DONKI service to determine when these solar events occur, then using data from the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory to compile a dataset that includes magnetograms of active regions of the Sun 24 hours before the events. By inputting the magnetograms into a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from this dataset, it can serve to predict whether a space weather event will occur, and what type of event it will be. The model was designed using a custom architecture CNN, and returned an accuracy of 90.27%, a precision of 85.83%, a recall of 91.78%, and an average F1 score of 92.14% across each class (Solar flare [Flare], geomagnetic storm [GMS], coronal mass ejection [CME]). Our results show that using magnetogram data as an input for a CNN is a viable method to space weather prediction. Future work can involve prediction of the magnitude of solar events.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model for a malware classification system based on Application Programming Interface (API) calls and opcodes, to improve classification accuracy. This system uses a novel design of combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory. We extract opcode sequences and API Calls from Windows malware samples for classification. We transform these features into N-grams (N = 2, 3, and 10)-gram sequences. Our experiments on a dataset of 9,749,57 samples produce high accuracy of 99.91% using the 8-gram sequences. Our method significantly improves the malware classification performance when using a wide range of recent deep learning architectures, leading to state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we experiment with ConvNeXt-T, ConvNeXt-S, RegNetY-4GF, RegNetY-8GF, RegNetY-12GF, EfficientNetV2, Sequencer2D-L, Swin-T, ViT-G/14, ViT-Ti, ViT-S, VIT-B, VIT-L, and MaxViT-B. Among these architectures, Swin-T and Sequencer2D-L architectures achieved high accuracies of 99.82% and 99.70%, respectively, comparable to our CNN-LSTM architecture although not surpassing it.</p>

<p>Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), continues to permeate healthcare, it remains crucial to supplement traditional automated evaluations with human expert evaluation. Understanding and evaluating the generated texts is vital for ensuring safety, reliability, and effectiveness. However, the cumbersome, time-consuming, and non-standardized nature of human evaluation presents significant obstacles to the widespread adoption of LLMs in practice. This study reviews existing literature on human evaluation methodologies for LLMs within healthcare. We highlight a notable need for a standardized and consistent human evaluation approach. Our extensive literature search, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, spans publications from January 2018 to February 2024. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the human evaluation approaches used in diverse healthcare applications.This analysis examines the human evaluation of LLMs across various medical specialties, addressing factors such as evaluation dimensions, sample types, and sizes, the selection and recruitment of evaluators, frameworks and metrics, the evaluation process, and statistical analysis of the results. Drawing from diverse evaluation strategies highlighted in these studies, we propose a comprehensive and practical framework for human evaluation of generative LLMs, named QUEST: Quality of Information, Understanding and Reasoning, Expression Style and Persona, Safety and Harm, and Trust and Confidence. This framework aims to improve the reliability, generalizability, and applicability of human evaluation of generative LLMs in different healthcare applications by defining clear evaluation dimensions and offering detailed guidelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenan Shao, Linjian Ma, Bo Li, Diane M. Beck</p>
<p>Abstract: Human object recognition exhibits remarkable resilience in cluttered and dynamic visual environments. In contrast, despite their unparalleled performance across numerous visual tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) remain far less robust than humans, showing, for example, a surprising susceptibility to adversarial attacks involving image perturbations that are (almost) imperceptible to humans. Human object recognition likely owes its robustness, in part, to the increasingly resilient representations that emerge along the hierarchy of the ventral visual cortex. Here we show that DNNs, when guided by neural representations from a hierarchical sequence of regions in the human ventral visual stream, display increasing robustness to adversarial attacks. These neural-guided models also exhibit a gradual shift towards more human-like decision-making patterns and develop hierarchically smoother decision surfaces. Importantly, the resulting representational spaces differ in important ways from those produced by conventional smoothing methods, suggesting that such neural-guidance may provide previously unexplored robustness solutions. Our findings support the gradual emergence of human robustness along the ventral visual hierarchy and suggest that the key to DNN robustness may lie in increasing emulation of the human brain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseo Kim, Hyeonseo Yang, Taekyung Kim, YoonSung Kim, Jin-Hwa Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning in 3D scene reconstruction has been widely studied, as selecting informative training views is critical for the reconstruction. Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) variants have shown performance increases in active 3D reconstruction using image rendering or geometric uncertainty. However, the simultaneous consideration of both uncertainties in selecting informative views remains unexplored, while utilizing different types of uncertainty can reduce the bias that arises in the early training stage with sparse inputs. In this paper, we propose ActiveNeuS, which evaluates candidate views considering both uncertainties. ActiveNeuS provides a way to accumulate image rendering uncertainty while avoiding the bias that the estimated densities can introduce. ActiveNeuS computes the neural implicit surface uncertainty, providing the color uncertainty along with the surface information. It efficiently handles the bias by using the surface information and a grid, enabling the fast selection of diverse viewpoints. Our method outperforms previous works on popular datasets, Blender and DTU, showing that the views selected by ActiveNeuS significantly improve performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JaeYoon Kim, Junyu Xuan, Christy Liang, Farookh Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training has been on the lookout for the virtue of a value function representation referred to as successor features (SFs), which decouples the dynamics of the environment from the rewards. It has a significant impact on the process of task-specific fine-tuning due to the decomposition. However, existing approaches struggle with local optima due to the unified intrinsic reward of exploration and exploitation without considering the linear regression problem and the discriminator supporting a small skill sapce. We propose a novel unsupervised pre-training model with SFs based on a non-monolithic exploration methodology. Our approach pursues the decomposition of exploitation and exploration of an agent built on SFs, which requires separate agents for the respective purpose. The idea will leverage not only the inherent characteristics of SFs such as a quick adaptation to new tasks but also the exploratory and task-agnostic capabilities. Our suggested model is termed Non-Monolithic unsupervised Pre-training with Successor features (NMPS), which improves the performance of the original monolithic exploration method of pre-training with SFs. NMPS outperforms Active Pre-training with Successor Features (APS) in a comparative experiment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Meng, Qian Zheng, Long Yang, Yilong Yin, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Policy-based methods have achieved remarkable success in solving challenging reinforcement learning problems. Among these methods, off-policy policy gradient methods are particularly important due to that they can benefit from off-policy data. However, these methods suffer from the high variance of the off-policy policy gradient (OPPG) estimator, which results in poor sample efficiency during training. In this paper, we propose an off-policy policy gradient method with the optimal action-dependent baseline (Off-OAB) to mitigate this variance issue. Specifically, this baseline maintains the OPPG estimator's unbiasedness while theoretically minimizing its variance. To enhance practical computational efficiency, we design an approximated version of this optimal baseline. Utilizing this approximation, our method (Off-OAB) aims to decrease the OPPG estimator's variance during policy optimization. We evaluate the proposed Off-OAB method on six representative tasks from OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo, where it demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the majority of these tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) has demonstrated superior sample efficiency in learning complex tasks compared to conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. However, the practical application of CDRL is encumbered by challenging projection steps, detailed parameter tuning, and domain knowledge. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a pioneering Continuous Distributional Model-Free RL algorithm tailored for continuous action spaces. The proposed algorithm simplifies the implementation of distributional RL, adopting an actor-critic architecture wherein the critic outputs a continuous probability distribution. Additionally, we propose an ensemble of multiple critics fused through a Kalman fusion mechanism to mitigate overestimation bias. Through a series of experiments, we validate that our proposed method is easy to train and serves as a sample-efficient solution for executing complex continuous-control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Liu, Yue Xue, Daoyuan Wu, Yuqiang Sun, Yi Li, Miaolei Shi, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this paper explores the potential of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to transfer existing human-written properties (e.g., those from Certora auditing reports) and automatically generate customized properties for unknown code. To this end, we embed existing properties into a vector database and retrieve a reference property for LLM-based in-context learning to generate a new prop- erty for a given code. While this basic process is relatively straight- forward, ensuring that the generated properties are (i) compilable, (ii) appropriate, and (iii) runtime-verifiable presents challenges. To address (i), we use the compilation and static analysis feedback as an external oracle to guide LLMs in iteratively revising the generated properties. For (ii), we consider multiple dimensions of similarity to rank the properties and employ a weighted algorithm to identify the top-K properties as the final result. For (iii), we design a dedicated prover to formally verify the correctness of the generated prop- erties. We have implemented these strategies into a novel system called PropertyGPT, with 623 human-written properties collected from 23 Certora projects. Our experiments show that PropertyGPT can generate comprehensive and high-quality properties, achieving an 80% recall compared to the ground truth. It successfully detected 26 CVEs/attack incidents out of 37 tested and also uncovered 12 zero-day vulnerabilities, resulting in $8,256 bug bounty rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xu, Jingzhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLM) can be costly. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) addresses the problems by training a fraction of the parameters, whose success reveals the expressiveness and flexibility of pretrained models. This paper studies the limit of PEFT, by further simplifying its design and reducing the number of trainable parameters beyond standard setups. To this end, we use Random Masking to fine-tune the pretrained model. Despite its simplicity, we show that Random Masking is surprisingly effective: with a larger-than-expected learning rate, Random Masking can match the performance of standard PEFT algorithms such as LoRA on various tasks, using fewer trainable parameters. We provide both empirical and theoretical explorations into the success of Random Masking. We show that masking induces a flatter loss landscape and more distant solutions, which allows for and necessitates large learning rates.</p>

We experiment with an approach using predictions from a fine-tuned LLM model to aid non-domain experts in annotating scientific entities within astronomy literature, with the goal of uncovering whether such a collaborative process can approximate domain expertise. Our results reveal moderate agreement between a domain expert and the LLM-assisted non-experts, as well as fair agreement between the domain expert and the LLM model's predictions. In an additional experiment, we compare the performance of finetuned and default LLMs on this task. We have also introduced a specialized scientific entity annotation scheme for astronomy, validated by a domain expert. Our approach adopts a scholarly research contribution-centric perspective, focusing exclusively on scientific entities relevant to the research theme. The resultant dataset, containing 5,000 annotated astronomy article titles, is made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous robots for gathering information on objects of interest has numerous real-world applications because of they improve efficiency, performance and safety. Realizing autonomy demands online planning algorithms to solve sequential decision making problems under uncertainty; because, objects of interest are often dynamic, object state, such as location is not directly observable and are obtained from noisy measurements. Such planning problems are notoriously difficult due to the combinatorial nature of predicting the future to make optimal decisions. For information theoretic planning algorithms, we develop a computationally efficient and effective approximation for the difficult problem of predicting the likely sensor measurements from uncertain belief states}. The approach more accurately predicts information gain from information gathering actions. Our theoretical analysis proves the proposed formulation achieves a lower prediction error than the current efficient-method. We demonstrate improved performance gains in radio-source tracking and localization problems using extensive simulated and field experiments with a multirotor aerial robot.</p>

We also analyze the poor gradient landscapes of traditional smoothness losses and propose a new smoothness definition based on homography instead. A simple yet effective mask feature module has also been added to further aggregate features on the object level. With all these adaptations, our method produces clear optical flow estimation with sharp boundaries around objects, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both KITTI and Sintel datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luise Ge, Brendan Juba, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik</p>
<p>Abstract: We study learnability of linear utility functions from pairwise comparison queries. In particular, we consider two learning objectives. The first objective is to predict out-of-sample responses to pairwise comparisons, whereas the second is to approximately recover the true parameters of the utility function. We show that in the passive learning setting, linear utilities are efficiently learnable with respect to the first objective, both when query responses are uncorrupted by noise, and under Tsybakov noise when the distributions are sufficiently "nice". In contrast, we show that utility parameters are not learnable for a large set of data distributions without strong modeling assumptions, even when query responses are noise-free. Next, we proceed to analyze the learning problem in an active learning setting. In this case, we show that even the second objective is efficiently learnable, and present algorithms for both the noise-free and noisy query response settings. Our results thus exhibit a qualitative learnability gap between passive and active learning from pairwise preference queries, demonstrating the value of the ability to select pairwise queries for utility learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexing Zhao, Guangsi Shi, Xiaopeng Wu, Ruohua Ren, Xiaojun Gao, Fuyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a key component of AI-driven drug discovery and molecular characterization learning. Despite recent advances, existing methods still face challenges such as limited ability to generalize, and inadequate representation of learning from unlabeled data, especially for tasks specific to molecular structures. To address these limitations, we introduce DIG-Mol, a novel self-supervised graph neural network framework for molecular property prediction. This architecture leverages the power of contrast learning with dual interaction mechanisms and unique molecular graph enhancement strategies. DIG-Mol integrates a momentum distillation network with two interconnected networks to efficiently improve molecular characterization. The framework's ability to extract key information about molecular structure and higher-order semantics is supported by minimizing loss of contrast. We have established DIG-Mol's state-of-the-art performance through extensive experimental evaluation in a variety of molecular property prediction tasks. In addition to demonstrating superior transferability in a small number of learning scenarios, our visualizations highlight DIG-Mol's enhanced interpretability and representation capabilities. These findings confirm the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming challenges faced by traditional methods and mark a significant advance in molecular property prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: The black box nature of deep learning models complicate their usage in critical applications such as remote sensing. Conformal prediction is a method to ensure trust in such scenarios. Subject to data exchangeability, conformal prediction provides finite sample coverage guarantees in the form of a prediction set that is guaranteed to contain the true class within a user defined error rate. In this letter we show that conformal prediction algorithms are related to the uncertainty of the deep learning model and that this relation can be used to detect if the deep learning model is out-of-calibration. Popular classification models like Resnet50, Densenet161, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2 are applied on remote sensing datasets such as the EuroSAT to demonstrate how under noisy scenarios the model outputs become untrustworthy. Furthermore an out-of-calibration detection procedure relating the model uncertainty and the average size of the conformal prediction set is presented.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational information seeking has evolved rapidly in the last few years with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), providing the basis for interpreting and responding in a naturalistic manner to user requests. The extended TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT) collection aims to enable researchers to test and evaluate their Conversational Search Agents (CSA). The collection contains a set of 36 personalized dialogues over 20 different topics each coupled with a Personal Text Knowledge Base (PTKB) that defines the bespoke user personas. A total of 344 turns with approximately 26,000 passages are provided as assessments on relevance, as well as additional assessments on generated responses over four key dimensions: relevance, completeness, groundedness, and naturalness. The collection challenges CSA to efficiently navigate diverse personal contexts, elicit pertinent persona information, and employ context for relevant conversations. The integration of a PTKB and the emphasis on decisional search tasks contribute to the uniqueness of this test collection, making it an essential benchmark for advancing research in conversational and interactive knowledge assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Coby Penso, Jacob Goldberger</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) quantifies network uncertainty by building a small prediction set with a pre-defined probability that the correct class is within this set. In this study we tackle the problem of CP calibration based on a validation set with noisy labels. We introduce a conformal score that is robust to label noise. The noise-free conformal score is estimated using the noisy labeled data and the noise level. In the test phase the noise-free score is used to form the prediction set. We applied the proposed algorithm to several standard medical imaging classification datasets. We show that our method outperforms current methods by a large margin, in terms of the average size of the prediction set, while maintaining the required coverage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Gioacchini, Idilio Drago, Marco Mellia, Zied Ben Houidi, Dario Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: Network traffic analysis is fundamental for network management, troubleshooting, and security. Tasks such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, and novelty discovery are fundamental for extracting operational information from network data and measurements. We witness the shift from deep packet inspection and basic machine learning to Deep Learning (DL) approaches where researchers define and test a custom DL architecture designed for each specific problem. We here advocate the need for a general DL architecture flexible enough to solve different traffic analysis tasks. We test this idea by proposing a DL architecture based on generic data adaptation modules, followed by an integration module that summarises the extracted information into a compact and rich intermediate representation (i.e. embeddings). The result is a flexible Multi-modal Autoencoder (MAE) pipeline that can solve different use cases. We demonstrate the architecture with traffic classification (TC) tasks since they allow us to quantitatively compare results with state-of-the-art solutions. However, we argue that the MAE architecture is generic and can be used to learn representations useful in multiple scenarios. On TC, the MAE performs on par or better than alternatives while avoiding cumbersome feature engineering, thus streamlining the adoption of DL solutions for traffic analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxim Ifergan, Renana Keydar, Omri Abend, Amit Pinchevski</p>
<p>Abstract: The vast collection of Holocaust survivor testimonies presents invaluable historical insights but poses challenges for manual analysis. This paper leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to explore the USC Shoah Foundation Holocaust testimony corpus. By treating testimonies as structured question-and-answer sections, we apply topic modeling to identify key themes. We experiment with BERTopic, which leverages recent advances in language modeling technology. We align testimony sections into fixed parts, revealing the evolution of topics across the corpus of testimonies. This highlights both a common narrative schema and divergences between subgroups based on age and gender. We introduce a novel method to identify testimonies within groups that exhibit atypical topic distributions resembling those of other groups. This study offers unique insights into the complex narratives of Holocaust survivors, demonstrating the power of NLP to illuminate historical discourse and identify potential deviations in survivor experiences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joaquim Comas, Adria Ruiz, Federico Sukno</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in remote heart rate measurement (rPPG), motivated by data-driven approaches, have significantly improved accuracy. However, certain challenges, such as video compression, still remain: recovering the rPPG signal from highly compressed videos is particularly complex. Although several studies have highlighted the difficulties and impact of video compression for this, effective solutions remain limited. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the impact of video compression on rPPG estimation, which leverages a pulse-signal magnification transformation to adapt compressed videos to an uncompressed data domain in which the rPPG signal is magnified. We validate the effectiveness of our model by exhaustive evaluations on two publicly available datasets, UCLA-rPPG and UBFC-rPPG, employing both intra- and cross-database performance at several compression rates. Additionally, we assess the robustness of our approach on two additional highly compressed and widely-used datasets, MAHNOB-HCI and COHFACE, which reveal outstanding heart rate estimation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Ren, Xiao-Jun Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The significance of network structures in promoting group cooperation within social dilemmas has been widely recognized. Prior studies attribute this facilitation to the assortment of strategies driven by spatial interactions. Although reinforcement learning has been employed to investigate the impact of dynamic interaction on the evolution of cooperation, there remains a lack of understanding about how agents develop neighbour selection behaviours and the formation of strategic assortment within an explicit interaction structure. To address this, our study introduces a computational framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma game. This framework allows agents to select dilemma strategies and interacting neighbours based on their long-term experiences, differing from existing research that relies on preset social norms or external incentives. By modelling each agent using two distinct Q-networks, we disentangle the coevolutionary dynamics between cooperation and interaction. The results indicate that long-term experience enables agents to develop the ability to identify non-cooperative neighbours and exhibit a preference for interaction with cooperative ones. This emergent self-organizing behaviour leads to the clustering of agents with similar strategies, thereby increasing network reciprocity and enhancing group cooperation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raghad Salameh, Mohamad Al Mdfaa, Nursultan Askarbekuly, Manuel Mazzara</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning to recite the Quran for non-Arabic speakers. We explore the possibility of crowdsourcing a carefully annotated Quranic dataset, on top of which AI models can be built to simplify the learning process. In particular, we use the volunteer-based crowdsourcing genre and implement a crowdsourcing API to gather audio assets. We integrated the API into an existing mobile application called NamazApp to collect audio recitations. We developed a crowdsourcing platform called Quran Voice for annotating the gathered audio assets. As a result, we have collected around 7000 Quranic recitations from a pool of 1287 participants across more than 11 non-Arabic countries, and we have annotated 1166 recitations from the dataset in six categories. We have achieved a crowd accuracy of 0.77, an inter-rater agreement of 0.63 between the annotators, and 0.89 between the labels assigned by the algorithm and the expert judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Saquib Sarfraz, Mei-Yen Chen, Lukas Layer, Kunyu Peng, Marios Koulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The current state of machine learning scholarship in Timeseries Anomaly Detection (TAD) is plagued by the persistent use of flawed evaluation metrics, inconsistent benchmarking practices, and a lack of proper justification for the choices made in novel deep learning-based model designs. Our paper presents a critical analysis of the status quo in TAD, revealing the misleading track of current research and highlighting problematic methods, and evaluation practices. Our position advocates for a shift in focus from pursuing only the novelty in model design to improving benchmarking practices, creating non-trivial datasets, and placing renewed emphasis on studying the utility of model architectures for specific tasks. Our findings demonstrate the need for rigorous evaluation protocols, the creation of simple baselines, and the revelation that state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection models effectively learn linear mappings. These findings suggest the need for more exploration and development of simple and interpretable TAD methods. The increment of model complexity in the state-of-the-art deep-learning based models unfortunately offers very little improvement. We offer insights and suggestions for the field to move forward.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Gao, Xin Yang, Hao Yu, Yan Kang, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) focuses on continually transferring the previous knowledge to learn new classes in dynamic Federated Learning (FL). However, existing methods do not consider the trustworthiness of FCIL, i.e., improving continual utility, privacy, and efficiency simultaneously, which is greatly influenced by catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity among clients. To address this issue, we propose FedProK (Federated Prototypical Feature Knowledge Transfer), leveraging prototypical feature as a novel representation of knowledge to perform spatial-temporal knowledge transfer. Specifically, FedProK consists of two components: (1) feature translation procedure on the client side by temporal knowledge transfer from the learned classes and (2) prototypical knowledge fusion on the server side by spatial knowledge transfer among clients. Extensive experiments conducted in both synchronous and asynchronous settings demonstrate that our FedProK outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in three perspectives of trustworthiness, validating its effectiveness in selectively transferring spatial-temporal knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yik San Cheng, Runkai Zhao, Heng Wang, Hanchuan Peng, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuron reconstruction, one of the fundamental tasks in neuroscience, rebuilds neuronal morphology from 3D light microscope imaging data. It plays a critical role in analyzing the structure-function relationship of neurons in the nervous system. However, due to the scarcity of neuron datasets and high-quality SWC annotations, it is still challenging to develop robust segmentation methods for single neuron reconstruction. To address this limitation, we aim to distill the consensus knowledge from massive natural image data to aid the segmentation model in learning the complex neuron structures. Specifically, in this work, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a 2D Vision Transformer model pre-trained on large-scale natural images to initialize our Transformer-based 3D neuron segmentation model with a tailored 2D-to-3D weight transferring strategy. Our method builds a knowledge sharing connection between the abundant natural and the scarce neuron image domains to improve the 3D neuron segmentation ability in a data-efficiency manner. Evaluated on a popular benchmark, BigNeuron, our method enhances neuron segmentation performance by 8.71% over the model trained from scratch with the same amount of training samples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated into everyday technology, including news, education, and social media. AI has further pervaded private conversations as conversational partners, auto-completion, and response suggestions. As social media becomes young people's main method of peer support exchange, we need to understand when and how AI can facilitate and assist in such exchanges in a beneficial, safe, and socially appropriate way. We asked 622 young people to complete an online survey and evaluate blinded human- and AI-generated responses to help-seeking messages. We found that participants preferred the AI-generated response to situations about relationships, self-expression, and physical health. However, when addressing a sensitive topic, like suicidal thoughts, young people preferred the human response. We also discuss the role of training in online peer support exchange and its implications for supporting young people's well-being.

The relation prediction task obtains knowledge graph completion by assigning one or more possible relations to each pair of nodes. In this work, we make use of the knowledge graph node names to fine-tune a large language model for the relation prediction task. By utilizing the node names only we enable our model to operate sufficiently in the inductive settings. Our experiments show that we accomplish new scores on a widely used knowledge graph benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhao, Emilio Monti, Jens Lehmann, Haytham Assem</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to inadequately integrate input context during text generation, relying excessively on encoded prior knowledge in model parameters, potentially resulting in generated text with factual inconsistencies or contextually unfaithful content. LLMs utilize two primary knowledge sources: 1) prior (parametric) knowledge from pretraining, and 2) contextual (non-parametric) knowledge from input prompts. The study addresses the open question of how LLMs effectively balance these knowledge sources during the generation process, specifically in the context of open-domain question answering. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach integrating contrastive decoding with adversarial irrelevant passages as negative samples to enhance robust context grounding during generation. Notably, our method operates at inference time without requiring further training. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness, providing empirical evidence showcasing its superiority over existing methodologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiye Zhao, Tairan He, Feihan Li, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable performance in many continuous control tasks. However, a significant obstacle to the real-world application of DRL is the lack of safety guarantees. Although DRL agents can satisfy system safety in expectation through reward shaping, designing agents to consistently meet hard constraints (e.g., safety specifications) at every time step remains a formidable challenge. In contrast, existing work in the field of safe control provides guarantees on persistent satisfaction of hard safety constraints. However, these methods require explicit analytical system dynamics models to synthesize safe control, which are typically inaccessible in DRL settings. In this paper, we present a model-free safe control algorithm, the implicit safe set algorithm, for synthesizing safeguards for DRL agents that ensure provable safety throughout training. The proposed algorithm synthesizes a safety index (barrier certificate) and a subsequent safe control law solely by querying a black-box dynamic function (e.g., a digital twin simulator). Moreover, we theoretically prove that the implicit safe set algorithm guarantees finite time convergence to the safe set and forward invariance for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. We validate the proposed algorithm on the state-of-the-art Safety Gym benchmark, where it achieves zero safety violations while gaining $95\% \pm 9\%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art safe DRL methods. Furthermore, the resulting algorithm scales well to high-dimensional systems with parallel computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Youssef, Zhixue Zhao, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques (KEs) can update language models' obsolete or inaccurate knowledge learned from pre-training. However, KE also faces potential malicious applications, e.g. inserting misinformation and toxic content. Moreover, in the context of responsible AI, it is instructive for end-users to know whether a generated output is driven by edited knowledge or first-hand knowledge from pre-training. To this end, we study detecting edited knowledge in language models by introducing a novel task: given an edited model and a specific piece of knowledge the model generates, our objective is to classify the knowledge as either "non-edited" (based on the pre-training), or ``edited'' (based on subsequent editing). We initiate the task with two state-of-the-art KEs, two language models, and two datasets. We further propose a simple classifier, RepReg, a logistic regression model that takes hidden state representations as input features. Our results reveal that RepReg establishes a strong baseline, achieving a peak accuracy of 99.81%, and 97.79% in out-of-domain settings. Second, RepReg achieves near-optimal performance with a limited training set (200 training samples), and it maintains its performance even in out-of-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging to separate edited and non-edited knowledge when they contain the same subject or object.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fahad Sarfraz, Bahram Zonooz, Elahe Arani</p>
<p>Abstract: While humans excel at continual learning (CL), deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit catastrophic forgetting. A salient feature of the brain that allows effective CL is that it utilizes multiple modalities for learning and inference, which is underexplored in DNNs. Therefore, we study the role and interactions of multiple modalities in mitigating forgetting and introduce a benchmark for multimodal continual learning. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging multiple views and complementary information from multiple modalities enables the model to learn more accurate and robust representations. This makes the model less vulnerable to modality-specific regularities and considerably mitigates forgetting. Furthermore, we observe that individual modalities exhibit varying degrees of robustness to distribution shift. Finally, we propose a method for integrating and aligning the information from different modalities by utilizing the relational structural similarities between the data points in each modality. Our method sets a strong baseline that enables both single- and multimodal inference. Our study provides a promising case for further exploring the role of multiple modalities in enabling CL and provides a standard benchmark for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The volume of unlabelled Earth observation (EO) data is huge, but many important applications lack labelled training data. However, EO data offers the unique opportunity to pair data from different modalities and sensors automatically based on geographic location and time, at virtually no human labor cost. We seize this opportunity to create a diverse multi-modal pretraining dataset at global scale. Using this new corpus of 1.2 million locations, we propose a Multi-Pretext Masked Autoencoder (MP-MAE) approach to learn general-purpose representations for optical satellite images. Our approach builds on the ConvNeXt V2 architecture, a fully convolutional masked autoencoder (MAE). Drawing upon a suite of multi-modal pretext tasks, we demonstrate that our MP-MAE approach outperforms both MAEs pretrained on ImageNet and MAEs pretrained on domain-specific satellite images. This is shown on several downstream tasks including image classification and semantic segmentation. We find that multi-modal pretraining notably improves the linear probing performance, e.g. 4pp on BigEarthNet and 16pp on So2Sat, compared to pretraining on optical satellite images only. We show that this also leads to better label and parameter efficiency which are crucial aspects in global scale applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work focuses on leveraging and selecting from vast, unlabeled, open data to pre-fine-tune a pre-trained language model. The goal is to minimize the need for costly domain-specific data for subsequent fine-tuning while achieving desired performance levels. While many data selection algorithms have been designed for small-scale applications, rendering them unsuitable for our context, some emerging methods do cater to language data scales. However, they often prioritize data that aligns with the target distribution. While this strategy may be effective when training a model from scratch, it can yield limited results when the model has already been pre-trained on a different distribution. Differing from prior work, our key idea is to select data that nudges the pre-training distribution closer to the target distribution. We show the optimality of this approach for fine-tuning tasks under certain conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology across a diverse array of tasks (NLU, NLG, zero-shot) with models up to 2.7B, showing that it consistently surpasses other selection methods. Moreover, our proposed method is significantly faster than existing techniques, scaling to millions of samples within a single GPU hour. Our code is open-sourced (Code repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DV4LLM-D761/ ). While fine-tuning offers significant potential for enhancing performance across diverse tasks, its associated costs often limit its widespread adoption; with this work, we hope to lay the groundwork for cost-effective fine-tuning, making its benefits more accessible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motion diffusion models have recently proven successful for text-driven human motion generation. Despite their excellent generation performance, they are challenging to infer in real time due to the multi-step sampling mechanism that involves tens or hundreds of repeat function evaluation iterations. To this end, we investigate a motion latent consistency Training (MLCT) for motion generation to alleviate the computation and time consumption during iteration inference. It applies diffusion pipelines to low-dimensional motion latent spaces to mitigate the computational burden of each function evaluation. Explaining the diffusion process with probabilistic flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) theory, the MLCT allows extremely few steps infer between the prior distribution to the motion latent representation distribution via maintaining consistency of the outputs over the trajectory of PF-ODE. Especially, we introduce a quantization constraint to optimize motion latent representations that are bounded, regular, and well-reconstructed compared to traditional variational constraints. Furthermore, we propose a conditional PF-ODE trajectory simulation method, which improves the conditional generation performance with minimal additional training costs. Extensive experiments on two human motion generation benchmarks show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with less than 10\% time cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has witnessed rapid advancements, facilitating the generation of music, images, and other forms of artistic expression across various industries. However, researches on general multi-modal music generation model remain scarce. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-modal music generation framework Mozart's Touch. It could generate aligned music with the cross-modality inputs, such as images, videos and text. Mozart's Touch is composed of three main components: Multi-modal Captioning Module, Large Language Model (LLM) Understanding & Bridging Module, and Music Generation Module.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leye Zhang, Xiangxiang Tian, Hongjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Attempt to use convolutional neural network to achieve kinematic analysis of plane bar structure. Through 3dsMax animation software and OpenCV module, self-build image dataset of geometrically stable system and geometrically unstable system. we construct and train convolutional neural network model based on the TensorFlow and Keras deep learning platform framework. The model achieves 100% accuracy on the training set, validation set, and test set. The accuracy on the additional test set is 93.7%, indicating that convolutional neural network can learn and master the relevant knowledge of kinematic analysis of structural mechanics. In the future, the generalization ability of the model can be improved through the diversity of dataset, which has the potential to surpass human experts for complex structures. Convolutional neural network has certain practical value in the field of kinematic analysis of structural mechanics. Using visualization technology, we reveal how convolutional neural network learns and recognizes structural features. Using pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and fine-tuning, we found that the generalization ability is inferior to the self-built model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhusi Zhong, Jie Li, Zhuoqi Ma, Scott Collins, Harrison Bai, Paul Zhang, Terrance Healey, Xinbo Gao, Michael K. Atalay, Zhicheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global public health, necessitating accurate diagnosis and intervention to control disease spread and reduce mortality rates. This paper introduces an interpretable deep survival prediction model designed specifically for improved understanding and trust in COVID-19 prognosis using chest X-ray (CXR) images. By integrating a large-scale pretrained image encoder, Risk-specific Grad-CAM, and anatomical region detection techniques, our approach produces regional interpretable outcomes that effectively capture essential disease features while focusing on rare but critical abnormal regions. Our model's predictive results provide enhanced clarity and transparency through risk area localization, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis with better understanding of prognostic insights. We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-center survival dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness via quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving superior C-indexes (0.764 and 0.727) and time-dependent AUCs (0.799 and 0.691). These results suggest that our explainable deep survival prediction model surpasses traditional survival analysis methods in risk prediction, improving interpretability for clinical decision making and enhancing AI system trustworthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changan Chen, Jordi Ramos, Anshul Tomar, Kristen Grauman</p>
<p>Abstract: Sim2real transfer has received increasing attention lately due to the success of learning robotic tasks in simulation end-to-end. While there has been a lot of progress in transferring vision-based navigation policies, the existing sim2real strategy for audio-visual navigation performs data augmentation empirically without measuring the acoustic gap. The sound differs from light in that it spans across much wider frequencies and thus requires a different solution for sim2real. We propose the first treatment of sim2real for audio-visual navigation by disentangling it into acoustic field prediction (AFP) and waypoint navigation. We first validate our design choice in the SoundSpaces simulator and show improvement on the Continuous AudioGoal navigation benchmark. We then collect real-world data to measure the spectral difference between the simulation and the real world by training AFP models that only take a specific frequency subband as input. We further propose a frequency-adaptive strategy that intelligently selects the best frequency band for prediction based on both the measured spectral difference and the energy distribution of the received audio, which improves the performance on the real data. Lastly, we build a real robot platform and show that the transferred policy can successfully navigate to sounding objects. This work demonstrates the potential of building intelligent agents that can see, hear, and act entirely from simulation, and transferring them to the real world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alicia Vidler, Toby Walsh</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring complex adaptive financial trading environments through multi-agent based simulation methods presents an innovative approach within the realm of quantitative finance. Despite the dominance of multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches in financial markets with observable data, there exists a set of systematically significant financial markets that pose challenges due to their partial or obscured data availability. We, therefore, devise a multi-agent simulation approach employing small-scale meta-heuristic methods. This approach aims to represent the opaque bilateral market for Australian government bond trading, capturing the bilateral nature of bank-to-bank trading, also referred to as "over-the-counter" (OTC) trading, and commonly occurring between "market makers". The uniqueness of the bilateral market, characterized by negotiated transactions and a limited number of agents, yields valuable insights for agent-based modelling and quantitative finance. The inherent rigidity of this market structure, which is at odds with the global proliferation of multilateral platforms and the decentralization of finance, underscores the unique insights offered by our agent-based model. We explore the implications of market rigidity on market structure and consider the element of stability, in market design. This extends the ongoing discourse on complex financial trading environments, providing an enhanced understanding of their dynamics and implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Melissa Xiaohui Qin, Hongming Li, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LexBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite enabled to test language models (LMs) on ten semantic phrase processing tasks. Unlike prior studies, it is the first work to propose a framework from the comparative perspective to model the general semantic phrase (i.e., lexical collocation) and three fine-grained semantic phrases, including idiomatic expression, noun compound, and verbal construction. Thanks to \ourbenchmark, we assess the performance of 15 LMs across model architectures and parameter scales in classification, extraction, and interpretation tasks. Through the experiments, we first validate the scaling law and find that, as expected, large models excel better than the smaller ones in most tasks. Second, we investigate further through the scaling semantic relation categorization and find that few-shot LMs still lag behind vanilla fine-tuned models in the task. Third, through human evaluation, we find that the performance of strong models is comparable to the human level regarding semantic phrase processing. Our benchmarking findings can serve future research aiming to improve the generic capability of LMs on semantic phrase comprehension.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohua Li, Maoli Liu, John C. S. Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational recommender systems have emerged as a potent solution for efficiently eliciting user preferences. These systems interactively present queries associated with "key terms" to users and leverage user feedback to estimate user preferences more efficiently. Nonetheless, most existing algorithms adopt a centralized approach. In this paper, we introduce FedConPE, a phase elimination-based federated conversational bandit algorithm, where $M$ agents collaboratively solve a global contextual linear bandit problem with the help of a central server while ensuring secure data management. To effectively coordinate all the clients and aggregate their collected data, FedConPE uses an adaptive approach to construct key terms that minimize uncertainty across all dimensions in the feature space. Furthermore, compared with existing federated linear bandit algorithms, FedConPE offers improved computational and communication efficiency as well as enhanced privacy protections. Our theoretical analysis shows that FedConPE is minimax near-optimal in terms of cumulative regret. We also establish upper bounds for communication costs and conversation frequency. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FedConPE outperforms existing conversational bandit algorithms while using fewer conversations.</p>

<p>Abstract: People communicate in more than 7,000 languages around the world, with around 780 languages spoken in India alone. Despite this linguistic diversity, research on Sentiment Analysis has predominantly focused on English text data, resulting in a disproportionate availability of sentiment resources for English. This paper examines the performance of transformer models in Sentiment Analysis tasks across multilingual datasets and text that has undergone machine translation. By comparing the effectiveness of these models in different linguistic contexts, we gain insights into their performance variations and potential implications for sentiment analysis across diverse languages. We also discuss the shortcomings and potential for future work towards the end.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fares Abawi, Di Fu, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous research on scanpath prediction has mainly focused on group models, disregarding the fact that the scanpaths and attentional behaviors of individuals are diverse. The disregard of these differences is especially detrimental to social human-robot interaction, whereby robots commonly emulate human gaze based on heuristics or predefined patterns. However, human gaze patterns are heterogeneous and varying behaviors can significantly affect the outcomes of such human-robot interactions. To fill this gap, we developed a deep learning-based social cue integration model for saliency prediction to instead predict scanpaths in videos. Our model learned scanpaths by recursively integrating fixation history and social cues through a gating mechanism and sequential attention. We evaluated our approach on gaze datasets of dynamic social scenes, observed under the free-viewing condition. The introduction of fixation history into our models makes it possible to train a single unified model rather than the resource-intensive approach of training individual models for each set of scanpaths. We observed that the late neural integration approach surpasses early fusion when training models on a large dataset, in comparison to a smaller dataset with a similar distribution. Results also indicate that a single unified model, trained on all the observers' scanpaths, performs on par or better than individually trained models. We hypothesize that this outcome is a result of the group saliency representations instilling universal attention in the model, while the supervisory signal guides it to learn personalized attentional behaviors, providing the unified model a benefit over individual models due to its implicit representation of universal attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reda Marzouk, Colin de La Higuera</p>
<p>Abstract: Thanks to its solid theoretical foundation, the SHAP framework is arguably one the most widely utilized frameworks for local explainability of ML models. Despite its popularity, its exact computation is known to be very challenging, proven to be NP-Hard in various configurations. Recent works have unveiled positive complexity results regarding the computation of the SHAP score for specific model families, encompassing decision trees, random forests, and some classes of boolean circuits. Yet, all these positive results hinge on the assumption of feature independence, often simplistic in real-world scenarios. In this article, we investigate the computational complexity of the SHAP score by relaxing this assumption and introducing a Markovian perspective. We show that, under the Markovian assumption, computing the SHAP score for the class of Weighted automata, Disjoint DNFs and Decision Trees can be performed in polynomial time, offering a first positive complexity result for the problem of SHAP score computation that transcends the limitations of the feature independence assumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hirokazu Ishida, Naoki Hiraoka, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba</p>
<p>Abstract: Library-based methods are known to be very effective for fast motion planning by adapting an experience retrieved from a precomputed library. This article presents CoverLib, a principled approach for constructing and utilizing such a library. CoverLib iteratively adds an experience-classifier-pair to the library, where each classifier corresponds to an adaptable region of the experience within the problem space. This iterative process is an active procedure, as it selects the next experience based on its ability to effectively cover the uncovered region. During the query phase, these classifiers are utilized to select an experience that is expected to be adaptable for a given problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CoverLib effectively mitigates the trade-off between plannability and speed observed in global (e.g. sampling-based) and local (e.g. optimization-based) methods. As a result, it achieves both fast planning and high success rates over the problem domain. Moreover, due to its adaptation-algorithm-agnostic nature, CoverLib seamlessly integrates with various adaptation methods, including nonlinear programming-based and sampling-based algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Currently, the generative model has garnered considerable attention due to its application in addressing the challenge of scarcity of abnormal samples in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, challenges persist regarding the edge deployment of generative models and the optimization of joint edge AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks. In this paper, we focus on the edge optimization of AIGC task execution and propose GMEL, a generative model-driven industrial AIGC collaborative edge learning framework. This framework aims to facilitate efficient few-shot learning by leveraging realistic sample synthesis and edge-based optimization capabilities. First, a multi-task AIGC computational offloading model is presented to ensure the efficient execution of heterogeneous AIGC tasks on edge servers. Then, we propose an attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) algorithm aimed at refining offloading policies within the IoT system, thereby supporting generative model-driven edge learning. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in optimizing the total system latency of the edge-based AIGC task completion.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents reports on a series of experiments with a novel dataset evaluating how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can mark (i.e. grade) open text responses to short answer questions, Specifically, we explore how well different combinations of GPT version and prompt engineering strategies performed at marking real student answers to short answer across different domain areas (Science and History) and grade-levels (spanning ages 5-16) using a new, never-used-before dataset from Carousel, a quizzing platform. We found that GPT-4, with basic few-shot prompting performed well (Kappa, 0.70) and, importantly, very close to human-level performance (0.75). This research builds on prior findings that GPT-4 could reliably score short answer reading comprehension questions at a performance-level very close to that of expert human raters. The proximity to human-level performance, across a variety of subjects and grade levels suggests that LLMs could be a valuable tool for supporting low-stakes formative assessment tasks in K-12 education and has important implications for real-world education delivery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have democratized its deployment as a healthcare assistant. While pretrained models from large-scale visual and audio datasets have demonstrably generalized to this task, surprisingly, no studies have explored pretrained speech models, which, as human-originated sounds, intuitively would share closer resemblance to lung sounds. This paper explores the efficacy of pretrained speech models for respiratory sound classification. We find that there is a characterization gap between speech and lung sound samples, and to bridge this gap, data augmentation is essential. However, the most widely used augmentation technique for audio and speech, SpecAugment, requires 2-dimensional spectrogram format and cannot be applied to models pretrained on speech waveforms. To address this, we propose RepAugment, an input-agnostic representation-level augmentation technique that outperforms SpecAugment, but is also suitable for respiratory sound classification with waveform pretrained models. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the SpecAugment, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the accuracy of minority disease classes, reaching up to 7.14%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their improved capabilities in generation and reasoning, adapting large language models (LLMs) to the biomedical domain remains challenging due to their immense size and corporate privacy. In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Qichao Wang, Aochuan Chen, Zijing Liu, Bingzhe Wu, Liang Chen, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation~(LoRA) has recently gained much interest in fine-tuning foundation models. It effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters by incorporating low-rank matrices $A$ and $B$ to represent the weight change, i.e., $\Delta W=BA$. Despite LoRA's progress, it faces storage challenges when handling extensive customization adaptations or larger base models. In this work, we aim to further compress trainable parameters by enjoying the powerful expressiveness of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we introduce FourierFT, which treats $\Delta W$ as a matrix in the spatial domain and learns only a small fraction of its spectral coefficients. With the trained spectral coefficients, we implement the inverse discrete Fourier transform to recover $\Delta W$. Empirically, our FourierFT method shows comparable or better performance with fewer parameters than LoRA on various tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and image classification. For example, when performing instruction tuning on the LLaMA2-7B model, FourierFT surpasses LoRA with only 0.064M trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 33.5M.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siow Meng Low, Akshat Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: In safe Reinforcement Learning (RL), safety cost is typically defined as a function dependent on the immediate state and actions. In practice, safety constraints can often be non-Markovian due to the insufficient fidelity of state representation, and safety cost may not be known. We therefore address a general setting where safety labels (e.g., safe or unsafe) are associated with state-action trajectories. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that specifically performs credit assignment to assess contributions of partial state-action trajectories on safety. This safety model is trained using a labeled safety dataset. Second, using RL-as-inference strategy we derive an effective algorithm for optimizing a safe policy using the learned safety model. Finally, we devise a method to dynamically adapt the tradeoff coefficient between reward maximization and safety compliance. We rewrite the constrained optimization problem into its dual problem and derive a gradient-based method to dynamically adjust the tradeoff coefficient during training. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach is highly scalable and able to satisfy sophisticated non-Markovian safety constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large bibliometric databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenAlex, facilitate bibliometric analyses, but are performative, affecting the visibility of scientific outputs and the impact measurement of participating entities. Recently, these databases have taken up the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in their respective classifications, which have been criticised for their diverging nature. This work proposes using the feature of large language models (LLMs) to learn about the "data bias" injected by diverse SDG classifications into bibliometric data by exploring five SDGs. We build a LLM that is fine-tuned in parallel by the diverse SDG classifications inscribed into the databases' SDG classifications. Our results show high sensitivity in model architecture, classified publications, fine-tuning process, and natural language generation. The wide arbitrariness at different levels raises concerns about using LLM in research practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Anthony, Francesco Giannini, Michelangelo Diligenti, Martin Homola, Marco Gori, Stefan Balogh, Jan Mojzis</p>
<p>Abstract: Malware detection is a constant challenge in cybersecurity due to the rapid development of new attack techniques. Traditional signature-based approaches struggle to keep pace with the sheer volume of malware samples. Machine learning offers a promising solution, but faces issues of generalization to unseen samples and a lack of explanation for the instances identified as malware. However, human-understandable explanations are especially important in security-critical fields, where understanding model decisions is crucial for trust and legal compliance. While deep learning models excel at malware detection, their black-box nature hinders explainability. Conversely, interpretable models often fall short in performance. To bridge this gap in this application domain, we propose the use of Logic Explained Networks (LENs), which are a recently proposed class of interpretable neural networks providing explanations in the form of First-Order Logic (FOL) rules. This paper extends the application of LENs to the complex domain of malware detection, specifically using the large-scale EMBER dataset. In the experimental results we show that LENs achieve robustness that exceeds traditional interpretable methods and that are rivaling black-box models. Moreover, we introduce a tailored version of LENs that is shown to generate logic explanations with higher fidelity with respect to the model's predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis systems for dermatological diseases. Accurate segmentation of skin lesions from medical images is essential for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. In this paper, we propose a new model for skin lesion segmentation namely AC-MambaSeg, an enhanced model that has the hybrid CNN-Mamba backbone, and integrates advanced components such as Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Attention Gate, and Selective Kernel Bottleneck. AC-MambaSeg leverages the Vision Mamba framework for efficient feature extraction, while CBAM and Selective Kernel Bottleneck enhance its ability to focus on informative regions and suppress background noise. We evaluate the performance of AC-MambaSeg on diverse datasets of skin lesion images including ISIC-2018 and PH2; then compare it against existing segmentation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelei Cheng, Xian Wu, Jiahao Yu, Sabrina Yang, Gang Wang, Xinyu Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is playing an increasingly important role in real-world applications. However, obtaining an optimally performing DRL agent for complex tasks, especially with sparse rewards, remains a significant challenge. The training of a DRL agent can be often trapped in a bottleneck without further progress. In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative refining scheme for reinforcement learning that incorporates explanation methods to break through the training bottlenecks. The high-level idea of RICE is to construct a new initial state distribution that combines both the default initial states and critical states identified through explanation methods, thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial states. Through careful design, we can theoretically guarantee that our refining scheme has a tighter sub-optimality bound. We evaluate RICE in various popular RL environments and real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RICE significantly outperforms existing refining schemes in enhancing agent performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duligur Ibeling, Thomas F. Icard, Milan Moss\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Ibeling et al. (2023). axiomatize increasingly expressive languages of causation and probability, and Mosse et al. (2024) show that reasoning (specifically the satisfiability problem) in each causal language is as difficult, from a computational complexity perspective, as reasoning in its merely probabilistic or "correlational" counterpart. Introducing a summation operator to capture common devices that appear in applications -- such as the $do$-calculus of Pearl (2009) for causal inference, which makes ample use of marginalization -- van der Zander et al. (2023) partially extend these earlier complexity results to causal and probabilistic languages with marginalization. We complete this extension, fully characterizing the complexity of probabilistic and causal reasoning with summation, demonstrating that these again remain equally difficult. Surprisingly, allowing free variables for random variable values results in a system that is undecidable, so long as the ranges of these random variables are unrestricted. We finally axiomatize these languages featuring marginalization (or more generally summation), resolving open questions posed by Ibeling et al. (2023).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George-Octavian Barbulescu, Peter Triantafillou</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have been found to memorize training textual sequences and regurgitate verbatim said sequences during text generation time. This fact is known to be the cause of privacy and related (e.g., copyright) problems. Unlearning in LLMs then takes the form of devising new algorithms that will properly deal with these side-effects of memorized data, while not hurting the model's utility. We offer a fresh perspective towards this goal, namely, that each textual sequence to be forgotten should be treated differently when being unlearned based on its degree of memorization within the LLM. We contribute a new metric for measuring unlearning quality, an adversarial attack showing that SOTA algorithms lacking this perspective fail for privacy, and two new unlearning methods based on Gradient Ascent and Task Arithmetic, respectively. A comprehensive performance evaluation across an extensive suite of NLP tasks then mapped the solution space, identifying the best solutions under different scales in model capacities and forget set sizes and quantified the gains of the new approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a promising tool for learning complex policies even in fast-moving and object-interactive domains where human teleoperation or hard-coded policies might fail. To effectively reflect this challenging category of tasks, we introduce a dynamic, interactive RL testbed based on robot air hockey. By augmenting air hockey with a large family of tasks ranging from easy tasks like reaching, to challenging ones like pushing a block by hitting it with a puck, as well as goal-based and human-interactive tasks, our testbed allows a varied assessment of RL capabilities. The robot air hockey testbed also supports sim-to-real transfer with three domains: two simulators of increasing fidelity and a real robot system. Using a dataset of demonstration data gathered through two teleoperation systems: a virtualized control environment, and human shadowing, we assess the testbed with behavior cloning, offline RL, and RL from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Liu, Feilong Chen, Shuai Fan, Chenpeng Du, Qi Chen, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper introduces AniTalker, an innovative framework designed to generate lifelike talking faces from a single portrait. Unlike existing models that primarily focus on verbal cues such as lip synchronization and fail to capture the complex dynamics of facial expressions and nonverbal cues, AniTalker employs a universal motion representation. This innovative representation effectively captures a wide range of facial dynamics, including subtle expressions and head movements. AniTalker enhances motion depiction through two self-supervised learning strategies: the first involves reconstructing target video frames from source frames within the same identity to learn subtle motion representations, and the second develops an identity encoder using metric learning while actively minimizing mutual information between the identity and motion encoders. This approach ensures that the motion representation is dynamic and devoid of identity-specific details, significantly reducing the need for labeled data. Additionally, the integration of a diffusion model with a variance adapter allows for the generation of diverse and controllable facial animations. This method not only demonstrates AniTalker's capability to create detailed and realistic facial movements but also underscores its potential in crafting dynamic avatars for real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Xue, Yaping Sun, Zhiyong Chen, Meixia Tao, Xiaodong Xu, Liang Qian, Shuguang Cui, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but how wireless communications can support LLMs has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed LLMs paradigm based on Mixture of Experts (MoE), named WDMoE, deploying LLMs collaboratively across edge servers of base station (BS) and mobile devices in the wireless communications system. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by deploying the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks across the devices. This arrangement leverages the parallel capabilities of expert networks on distributed devices. Moreover, to overcome the instability of wireless communications, we design an expert selection policy by taking into account both the performance of the model and the end-to-end latency, which includes both transmission delay and inference delay. Evaluations conducted across various LLMs and multiple datasets demonstrate that WDMoE not only outperforms existing models, such as Llama 2 with 70 billion parameters, but also significantly reduces end-to-end latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The current clinical gold standard for evaluating adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is X-ray radiography, using Cobb angle measurement. However, the frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge due to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been validated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis assessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out manually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic system that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this end, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle (UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate landmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An affinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area to illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks. Subsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered affinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for UCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for landmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic UCA and Cobb angle (R$^2$=0.858) suggests that our proposed method can potentially replace manual UCA measurement in ultrasound scoliosis assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sher Badshah, Hassan Sajjad</p>
<p>Abstract: Scale is often attributed as one of the factors that cause an increase in the performance of LLMs, resulting in models with billion and trillion parameters. One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, a time series algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) optimization is used to forecast stock prices effectively, taking into account the trend of the big data era. The data are first analyzed by descriptive statistics, and then the model is built and trained and tested on the dataset. After optimization and adjustment, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the model gradually decreases from 0.11 to 0.01 and tends to be stable, indicating that the model prediction effect is gradually close to the real value. The results on the test set show that the time series algorithm optimized based on Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) is able to accurately predict the stock prices, and is highly consistent with the actual price trends and values, with strong generalization ability. The MAE on the test set is 2.41, the MSE is 9.84, the RMSE is 3.13, and the R2 is 0.87. This research result not only provides a novel stock price prediction method, but also provides a useful reference for financial market analysis using computer technology and big data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many clinical tasks require an understanding of specialized data, such as medical images and genomics, which is not typically found in general-purpose large multimodal models. Building upon Gemini's multimodal models, we develop several models within the new Med-Gemini family that inherit core capabilities of Gemini and are optimized for medical use via fine-tuning with 2D and 3D radiology, histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology and genomic data. Med-Gemini-2D sets a new standard for AI-based chest X-ray (CXR) report generation based on expert evaluation, exceeding previous best results across two separate datasets by an absolute margin of 1% and 12%, where 57% and 96% of AI reports on normal cases, and 43% and 65% on abnormal cases, are evaluated as "equivalent or better" than the original radiologists' reports. We demonstrate the first ever large multimodal model-based report generation for 3D computed tomography (CT) volumes using Med-Gemini-3D, with 53% of AI reports considered clinically acceptable, although additional research is needed to meet expert radiologist reporting quality. Beyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D surpasses the previous best performance in CXR visual question answering (VQA) and performs well in CXR classification and radiology VQA, exceeding SoTA or baselines on 17 of 20 tasks. In histopathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology image classification, Med-Gemini-2D surpasses baselines across 18 out of 20 tasks and approaches task-specific model performance. Beyond imaging, Med-Gemini-Polygenic outperforms the standard linear polygenic risk score-based approach for disease risk prediction and generalizes to genetically correlated diseases for which it has never been trained. Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical medical domain, our results highlight the potential of Med-Gemini across a wide range of medical tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning is evolving towards high-order models that necessitate pre-training on extensive datasets, a process associated with significant overheads. Traditional models, despite having pre-trained weights, are becoming obsolete due to architectural differences that obstruct the effective transfer and initialization of these weights. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, QuadraNet V2, which leverages quadratic neural networks to create efficient and sustainable high-order learning models. Our method initializes the primary term of the quadratic neuron using a standard neural network, while the quadratic term is employed to adaptively enhance the learning of data non-linearity or shifts. This integration of pre-trained primary terms with quadratic terms, which possess advanced modeling capabilities, significantly augments the information characterization capacity of the high-order network. By utilizing existing pre-trained weights, QuadraNet V2 reduces the required GPU hours for training by 90\% to 98.4\% compared to training from scratch, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Li, Yanjun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the "logit lens" method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only correct the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integrated into our daily lives, serving as invaluable assistants in completing tasks. Widely embraced by users, the abuse of LLMs is inevitable, particularly in using them to generate text content for various purposes, leading to difficulties in distinguishing between text generated by LLMs and that written by humans.

We conducted evaluations using state-of-the-art methods, including ViT5, BartPho, PhoBERT, mDeberta V3, and mBERT. These results contribute not only to the growing body of research on detecting text generated by AI but also demonstrate the adaptability and effectiveness of different methods in the Vietnamese language context.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Mei, Yuxi Zhou, Jiahao Xu, Yuxuan Wan, Shan Cao, Qinghao Zhao, Shijia Geng, Junqing Xie, Shenda Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung condition that causes airflow obstruction. The existing methods can only detect patients who already have COPD based on obvious features shown in the spirogram (In this article, the spirogram specifically involves measuring Volume-Flow curve time series). Early prediction of COPD risk is vital for monitoring COPD disease progression, slowing it down, or even preventing its onset. However, these methods fail to early predict an individual's probability of COPD in the future based on subtle features in the spirogram. To address this gap, for the first time, we propose DeepSpiro, a method based on deep learning for early prediction of future COPD risk. DeepSpiro consists of four parts. First, we construct Volume-Flow curves guided by Time-Volume instability smoothing (SpiroSmoother) to enhance the stability of the original Volume-Flow curves precisely. Second, we extract critical features from the evolution of varied-length key patches (SpiroEncoder) to capture the key temporal evolution from original high-dimensional dynamic sequences to a unified low-dimensional temporal representation. Third, we explain the model based on temporal attention and heterogeneous feature fusion (SpiroExplainer), which integrates information from heterogeneous data such as spirogram and demographic information. Fourth, we predict the risk of COPD based on the evolution of key patch concavity (SpiroPredictor), enabling accurate prediction of the risk of disease in high-risk patients who are not yet diagnosed, for up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, and beyond. We conduct experiments on the UK Biobank dataset. Results show that DeepSpiro achieves an AUC value of 0.8328 in the task of detecting COPD. In early prediction tasks, high-risk and low-risk groups show significant differences in the future, with a p-value of <0.001.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Zhuansun, Dandan Li, Xiaohong Huang, Caijun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning can train models without directly providing local data to the server. However, the frequent updating of the local model brings the problem of large communication overhead. Recently, scholars have achieved the communication efficiency of federated learning mainly by model compression. But they ignore two problems: 1) network state of each client changes dynamically; 2) network state among clients is not the same. The clients with poor bandwidth update local model slowly, which leads to low efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient federated learning algorithm with adaptive compression under dynamic bandwidth (called AdapComFL). Concretely, each client performs bandwidth awareness and bandwidth prediction. Then, each client adaptively compresses its local model via the improved sketch mechanism based on his predicted bandwidth. Further, the server aggregates sketched models with different sizes received. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are based on real bandwidth data which are collected from the network topology we build, and benchmark datasets which are obtained from open repositories. We show the performance of AdapComFL algorithm, and compare it with existing algorithms. The experimental results show that our AdapComFL achieves more efficient communication as well as competitive accuracy compared to existing algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: The softmax activation function plays a crucial role in the success of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the self-attention mechanism of the widely adopted Transformer architecture. However, the underlying learning dynamics that contribute to the effectiveness of softmax remain largely unexplored. As a step towards better understanding, this paper provides a theoretical study of the optimization and generalization properties of two-layer softmax neural networks, providing theoretical insights into their superior performance as other activation functions, such as ReLU and exponential. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, our analysis reveals that the normalization effect of the softmax function leads to a good perturbation property of the induced NTK matrix, resulting in a good convex region of the loss landscape. Consequently, softmax neural networks can learn the target function in the over-parametrization regime. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our theoretical findings, we apply them to the task of learning score estimation functions in diffusion models, a promising approach for generative modeling. Our analysis shows that gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of softmax neural networks and their potential in various domains, paving the way for further advancements in natural language processing and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the course of the energy transition, the expansion of generation and consumption will change, and many of these technologies, such as PV systems, electric cars and heat pumps, will influence the power flow, especially in the distribution grids. Scalable methods that can make decisions for each grid connection are needed to enable congestion-free grid operation in the distribution grids. This paper presents a novel end-to-end approach to resolving congestion in distribution grids with deep reinforcement learning. Our architecture learns to curtail power and set appropriate reactive power to determine a non-congested and, thus, feasible grid state. State-of-the-art methods such as the optimal power flow (OPF) demand high computational costs and detailed measurements of every bus in a grid. In contrast, the presented method enables decisions under sparse information with just some buses observable in the grid. Distribution grids are generally not yet fully digitized and observable, so this method can be used for decision-making on the majority of low-voltage grids. On a real low-voltage grid the approach resolves 100\% of violations in the voltage band and 98.8\% of asset overloads. The results show that decisions can also be made on real grids that guarantee sufficient quality for congestion-free grid operation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhuo Lu, Changde Du, Chong Wang, Xuanliu Zhu, Liuyun Jiang, Huiguang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing human dynamic vision from brain activity is a challenging task with great scientific significance. The difficulty stems from two primary issues: (1) vision-processing mechanisms in the brain are highly intricate and not fully revealed, making it challenging to directly learn a mapping between fMRI and video; (2) the temporal resolution of fMRI is significantly lower than that of natural videos. To overcome these issues, this paper propose a two-stage model named Mind-Animator, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets. Specifically, during the fMRI-to-feature stage, we decouple semantic, structural, and motion features from fMRI through fMRI-vision-language tri-modal contrastive learning and sparse causal attention. In the feature-to-video stage, these features are merged to videos by an inflated Stable Diffusion. We substantiate that the reconstructed video dynamics are indeed derived from fMRI, rather than hallucinations of the generative model, through permutation tests. Additionally, the visualization of voxel-wise and ROI-wise importance maps confirms the neurobiological interpretability of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Huang, Wen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral graph convolutional network (SGCN) is a kind of graph neural networks (GNN) based on graph signal filters, and has shown compelling expressivity for modeling graph-structured data. Most SGCNs adopt polynomial filters and learn the coefficients from the training data. Many of them focus on which polynomial basis leads to optimal expressive power and models' architecture is little discussed. In this paper, we propose a general form in terms of spectral graph convolution, where the coefficients of polynomial basis are stored in a third-order tensor. Then, we show that the convolution block in existing SGCNs can be derived by performing a certain coefficient decomposition operation on the coefficient tensor. Based on the generalized view, we develop novel spectral graph convolutions CoDeSGC-CP and -Tucker by tensor decomposition CP and Tucker on the coefficient tensor. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed convolutions achieve favorable performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Costantino, Sophie Giffard-Roisin, Mauro Dalla Mura, Anne Socquet</p>
<p>Abstract: Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet, as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals. Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lemuel Puglisi, Daniel C. Alexander, Daniele Rav\`i</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal disease progression model based on latent diffusion. BrLP is designed to predict the evolution of diseases at the individual level on 3D brain MRIs. Existing deep generative models developed for this task are primarily data-driven and face challenges in learning disease progressions. BrLP addresses these challenges by incorporating prior knowledge from disease models to enhance the accuracy of predictions. To implement this, we propose to integrate an auxiliary model that infers volumetric changes in various brain regions. Additionally, we introduce Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), a novel technique to improve spatiotemporal consistency of the predicted progression. BrLP is trained and evaluated on a large dataset comprising 11,730 T1-weighted brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects, collected from three publicly available, longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease (AD) studies. In our experiments, we compare the MRI scans generated by BrLP with the actual follow-up MRIs available from the subjects, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal settings. BrLP demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, with an increase of 22% in volumetric accuracy across AD-related brain regions and 43% in image similarity to the ground-truth scans. The ability of BrLP to generate conditioned 3D scans at the subject level, along with the novelty of integrating prior knowledge to enhance accuracy, represents a significant advancement in disease progression modeling, opening new avenues for precision medicine.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiefeng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Q-learning excels in learning from feedback within sequential decision-making tasks but requires extensive sampling for significant improvements. Although reward shaping is a powerful technique for enhancing learning efficiency, it can introduce biases that affect agent performance. Furthermore, potential-based reward shaping is constrained as it does not allow for reward modifications based on actions or terminal states, potentially limiting its effectiveness in complex environments. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) can achieve zero-shot learning, but this is generally limited to simpler tasks. They also exhibit low inference speeds and occasionally produce hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{LLM-guided Q-learning} that employs LLMs as heuristic to aid in learning the Q-function for reinforcement learning. It combines the advantages of both technologies without introducing performance bias. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the LLM heuristic provides action-level guidance. Additionally, our architecture has the capability to convert the impact of hallucinations into exploration costs. Moreover, the converged Q function corresponds to the MDP optimal Q function. Experiment results demonstrated that our algorithm enables agents to avoid ineffective exploration, enhances sampling efficiency, and is well-suited for complex control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Yaseen Jabarulla, Steffen Oeltze-Jafra, Philipp Beerbaum, Theodor Uden</p>
<p>Abstract: This research focuses on evaluating the non-commercial open-source large language models (LLMs) Meditron, MedAlpaca, Mistral, and Llama-2 for their efficacy in interpreting medical guidelines saved in PDF format. As a specific test scenario, we applied these models to the guidelines for hypertension in children and adolescents provided by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Leveraging Streamlit, a Python library, we developed a user-friendly medical document chatbot tool (MedDoc-Bot). This tool enables authorized users to upload PDF files and pose questions, generating interpretive responses from four locally stored LLMs. A pediatric expert provides a benchmark for evaluation by formulating questions and responses extracted from the ESC guidelines. The expert rates the model-generated responses based on their fidelity and relevance. Additionally, we evaluated the METEOR and chrF metric scores to assess the similarity of model responses to reference answers. Our study found that Llama-2 and Mistral performed well in metrics evaluation. However, Llama-2 was slower when dealing with text and tabular data. In our human evaluation, we observed that responses created by Mistral, Meditron, and Llama-2 exhibited reasonable fidelity and relevance. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs for future developments in medical document interpretation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxue Yu, Xingfu Yi, Rongpeng Li, Fei Wang, Chenghui Peng, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the evolution towards 6G, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with advanced network infrastructure emerges as a pivotal strategy for enhancing network intelligence and resource utilization. Existing distributed learning frameworks like Federated Learning and Split Learning often struggle with significant challenges in dynamic network environments including high synchronization demands, costly communication overheads, severe computing resource consumption, and data heterogeneity across network nodes. These obstacles hinder the applications of ubiquitous computing capabilities of 6G networks, especially in light of the trend of escalating model parameters and training data volumes. To address these challenges effectively, this paper introduces "Snake Learning", a cost-effective distributed learning framework. Specifically, Snake Learning respects the heterogeneity of inter-node computing capability and local data distribution in 6G networks, and sequentially trains the designated part of model layers on individual nodes. This layer-by-layer serpentine update mechanism contributes to significantly reducing the requirements for storage, memory and communication during the model training phase, and demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency for both Computer Vision (CV) training and Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning tasks across homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stone Tao, Arth Shukla, Tse-kai Chan, Hao Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising framework to learn policies through environment interaction, but often requires an infeasible amount of interaction data to solve complex tasks from sparse rewards. One direction includes augmenting RL with offline data demonstrating desired tasks, but past work often require a lot of high-quality demonstration data that is difficult to obtain, especially for domains such as robotics. Our approach consists of a reverse curriculum followed by a forward curriculum. Unique to our approach compared to past work is the ability to efficiently leverage more than one demonstration via a per-demonstration reverse curriculum generated via state resets. The result of our reverse curriculum is an initial policy that performs well on a narrow initial state distribution and helps overcome difficult exploration problems. A forward curriculum is then used to accelerate the training of the initial policy to perform well on the full initial state distribution of the task and improve demonstration and sample efficiency. We show how the combination of a reverse curriculum and forward curriculum in our method, RFCL, enables significant improvements in demonstration and sample efficiency compared against various state-of-the-art learning-from-demonstration baselines, even solving previously unsolvable tasks that require high precision and control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Bergman, Lennart Purucker, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art automated machine learning systems for tabular data often employ cross-validation; ensuring that measured performances generalize to unseen data, or that subsequent ensembling does not overfit. However, using k-fold cross-validation instead of holdout validation drastically increases the computational cost of validating a single configuration. While ensuring better generalization and, by extension, better performance, the additional cost is often prohibitive for effective model selection within a time budget. We aim to make model selection with cross-validation more effective. Therefore, we study early stopping the process of cross-validation during model selection. We investigate the impact of early stopping on random search for two algorithms, MLP and random forest, across 36 classification datasets. We further analyze the impact of the number of folds by considering 3-, 5-, and 10-folds. In addition, we investigate the impact of early stopping with Bayesian optimization instead of random search and also repeated cross-validation. Our exploratory study shows that even a simple-to-understand and easy-to-implement method consistently allows model selection to converge faster; in ~94% of all datasets, on average by ~214%. Moreover, stopping cross-validation enables model selection to explore the search space more exhaustively by considering +167% configurations on average within one hour, while also obtaining better overall performance.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03401">E2GNN: Efficient Graph Neural Network Ensembles for Semi-Supervised Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Daochen Zha, Qiaoyu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting. Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners. However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons. First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency. Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited. In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes. Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes. Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP. By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance. Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvid Weyrauch, Thomas Steens, Oskar Taubert, Benedikt Hanke, Aslan Eqbal, Ewa G\"otz, Achim Streit, Markus G\"otz, Charlotte Debus</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have recently gained prominence in long time series forecasting by elevating accuracies in a variety of use cases. Regrettably, in the race for better predictive performance the overhead of model architectures has grown onerous, leading to models with computational demand infeasible for most practical applications. To bridge the gap between high method complexity and realistic computational resources, we introduce the Residual Cyclic Transformer, ReCycle. ReCycle utilizes primary cycle compression to address the computational complexity of the attention mechanism in long time series. By learning residuals from refined smoothing average techniques, ReCycle surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy in a variety of application use cases. The reliable and explainable fallback behavior ensured by simple, yet robust, smoothing average techniques additionally lowers the barrier for user acceptance. At the same time, our approach reduces the run time and energy consumption by more than an order of magnitude, making both training and inference feasible on low-performance, low-power and edge computing devices.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qunlong Ma, Zhi Ma, Ming Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: For Ising models with complex energy landscapes, whether the ground state can be found by neural networks depends heavily on the Hamming distance between the training datasets and the ground state. Despite the fact that various recently proposed generative models have shown good performance in solving Ising models, there is no adequate discussion on how to quantify their generalization capabilities. Here we design a Hamming distance regularizer in the framework of a class of generative models, variational autoregressive networks (VAN), to quantify the generalization capabilities of various network architectures combined with VAN. The regularizer can control the size of the overlaps between the ground state and the training datasets generated by networks, which, together with the success rates of finding the ground state, form a quantitative metric to quantify their generalization capabilities. We conduct numerical experiments on several prototypical network architectures combined with VAN, including feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks, to quantify their generalization capabilities when solving Ising models. Moreover, considering the fact that the quantification of the generalization capabilities of networks on small-scale problems can be used to predict their relative performance on large-scale problems, our method is of great significance for assisting in the Neural Architecture Search field of searching for the optimal network architectures when solving large-scale Ising models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we present an implementation strategy for a robot that performs peg transfer tasks in Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) via imitation learning, aimed at the development of an autonomous robot for laparoscopic surgery. Robotic laparoscopic surgery presents two main challenges: (1) the need to manipulate forceps using ports established on the body surface as fulcrums, and (2) difficulty in perceiving depth information when working with a monocular camera that displays its images on a monitor. Especially, regarding issue (2), most prior research has assumed the availability of depth images or models of a target to be operated on. Therefore, in this study, we achieve more accurate imitation learning with only monocular images by extracting motion constraints from one exemplary motion of skilled operators, collecting data based on these constraints, and conducting imitation learning based on the collected data. We implemented an overall system using two Franka Emika Panda Robot Arms and validated its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the capabilities of an augmented democracy system built on off-the-shelf LLMs fine-tuned on data summarizing individual preferences across 67 policy proposals collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. We use a train-test cross-validation setup to estimate the accuracy with which the LLMs predict both: a subject's individual political choices and the aggregate preferences of the full sample of participants. At the individual level, the accuracy of the out of sample predictions lie in the range 69%-76% and are significantly better at predicting the preferences of liberal and college educated participants. At the population level, we aggregate preferences using an adaptation of the Borda score and compare the ranking of policy proposals obtained from a probabilistic sample of participants and from data augmented using LLMs. We find that the augmented data predicts the preferences of the full population of participants better than probabilistic samples alone when these represent less than 30% to 40% of the total population. These results indicate that LLMs are potentially useful for the construction of systems of augmented democracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: In lossy image compression, the objective is to achieve minimal signal distortion while compressing images to a specified bit rate. The increasing demand for visual analysis applications, particularly in classification tasks, has emphasized the significance of considering semantic distortion in compressed images. To bridge the gap between image compression and visual analysis, we propose a Rate-Distortion-Classification (RDC) model for lossy image compression, offering a unified framework to optimize the trade-off between rate, distortion, and classification accuracy. The RDC model is extensively analyzed both statistically on a multi-distribution source and experimentally on the widely used MNIST dataset. The findings reveal that the RDC model exhibits desirable properties, including monotonic non-increasing and convex functions, under certain conditions. This work provides insights into the development of human-machine friendly compression methods and Video Coding for Machine (VCM) approaches, paving the way for end-to-end image compression techniques in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-label learning (MLL) requires comprehensive multi-semantic annotations that is hard to fully obtain, thus often resulting in missing labels scenarios. In this paper, we investigate Single Positive Multi-label Learning (SPML), where each image is associated with merely one positive label. Existing SPML methods only focus on designing losses using mechanisms such as hard pseudo-labeling and robust losses, mostly leading to unacceptable false negatives. To address this issue, we first propose a generalized loss framework based on expected risk minimization to provide soft pseudo labels, and point out that the former losses can be seamlessly converted into our framework. In particular, we design a novel robust loss based on our framework, which enjoys flexible coordination between false positives and false negatives, and can additionally deal with the imbalance between positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments show that our approach can significantly improve SPML performance and outperform the vast majority of state-of-the-art methods on all the four benchmarks.</p>

To solve this problem, we propose a method named $Meta$-$Evolve$ that uses continuous robot evolution to efficiently transfer the policy to each target robot through a set of tree-structured evolutionary robot sequences. The robot evolution tree allows the robot evolution paths to be shared, so our approach can significantly outperform naive one-to-one policy transfer. We present a heuristic approach to determine an optimized robot evolution tree. Experiments have shown that our method is able to improve the efficiency of one-to-three transfer of manipulation policy by up to 3.2$\times$ and one-to-six transfer of agile locomotion policy by 2.4$\times$ in terms of simulation cost over the baseline of launching multiple independent one-to-one policy transfers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web phishing poses a dynamic threat, requiring detection systems to quickly adapt to the latest tactics. Traditional approaches of accumulating data and periodically retraining models are outpaced. We propose a novel paradigm combining federated learning and continual learning, enabling distributed nodes to continually update models on streams of new phishing data, without accumulating data. These locally adapted models are then aggregated at a central server via federated learning. To enhance detection, we introduce a custom attention-based classifier model with residual connections, tailored for web phishing, leveraging attention mechanisms to capture intricate phishing patterns. We evaluate our hybrid learning paradigm across continual learning strategies (cumulative, replay, MIR, LwF) and model architectures through an empirical investigation. Our main contributions are: (1) a new hybrid federated-continual learning paradigm for robust web phishing detection, and (2) a novel attention + residual connections based model explicitly designed for this task, attaining 0.93 accuracy, 0.90 precision, 0.96 recall and 0.93 f1-score with the LwF strategy, outperforming traditional approaches in detecting emerging phishing threats while retaining past knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thennarasi Balakrishnan, Sandeep Singh Sengar</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection algorithms particularly those based on YOLO have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in balancing speed and accuracy. However, their application in brain tumour detection remains underexplored. This study proposes RepVGG-GELAN, a novel YOLO architecture enhanced with RepVGG, a reparameterized convolutional approach for object detection tasks particularly focusing on brain tumour detection within medical images. RepVGG-GELAN leverages the RepVGG architecture to improve both speed and accuracy in detecting brain tumours. Integrating RepVGG into the YOLO framework aims to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. This study includes a spatial pyramid pooling-based Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) architecture which further enhances the capability of RepVGG. Experimental evaluation conducted on a brain tumour dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of RepVGG-GELAN surpassing existing RCS-YOLO in terms of precision and speed. Specifically, RepVGG-GELAN achieves an increased precision of 4.91% and an increased AP50 of 2.54% over the latest existing approach while operating at 240.7 GFLOPs. The proposed RepVGG-GELAN with GELAN architecture presents promising results establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for accurate and efficient brain tumour detection in medical images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyou Song, Yingtao Tian, Robert Tjarko Lange, Chansoo Lee, Yujin Tang, Yutian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Undeniably, Large Language Models (LLMs) have stirred an extraordinary wave of innovation in the machine learning research domain, resulting in substantial impact across diverse fields such as reinforcement learning, robotics, and computer vision. Their incorporation has been rapid and transformative, marking a significant paradigm shift in the field of machine learning research.
  However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their relationship with previous literature. We discuss the most promising ways foundational language models can revolutionize optimization, which include harnessing the vast wealth of information encapsulated in free-form text to enrich task comprehension, utilizing highly flexible sequence models such as Transformers to engineer superior optimization strategies, and enhancing performance prediction over previously unseen search spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxin Chen, Minpeng Liao, Chengxi Li, Kai Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially enhanced their mathematical reasoning abilities. However, these models still struggle with complex problems that require multiple reasoning steps, frequently leading to logical or numerical errors. While numerical mistakes can largely be addressed by integrating a code interpreter, identifying logical errors within intermediate steps is more challenging. Moreover, manually annotating these steps for training is not only expensive but also demands specialized expertise. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that eliminates the need for manual annotation by leveraging the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to generate both the process supervision and evaluation signals automatically. Essentially, when a LLM is well pre-trained, only the mathematical questions and their final answers are required to generate our training data, without requiring the solutions. We proceed to train a step-level value model designed to improve the LLM's inference process in mathematical domains. Our experiments indicate that using automatically generated solutions by LLMs enhanced with MCTS significantly improves the model's proficiency in dealing with intricate mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ShuQi Ye, Yuan Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) is highly important in the real world. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been widely employed for acoustic scene classification. However, these methods are currently not lightweight enough as well as their performance is not satisfactory. To solve these problems, we propose a deep space separable distillation network. Firstly, the network performs high-low frequency decomposition on the log-mel spectrogram, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining model performance. Secondly, we specially design three lightweight operators for ASC, including Separable Convolution (SC), Orthonormal Separable Convolution (OSC), and Separable Partial Convolution (SPC). These operators exhibit highly efficient feature extraction capabilities in acoustic scene classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a performance gain of 9.8% compared to the currently popular deep learning methods, while also having smaller parameter count and computational complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Agarwalla, Abhay Gupta, Alexandre Marques, Shubhra Pandit, Michael Goin, Eldar Kurtic, Kevin Leong, Tuan Nguyen, Mahmoud Salem, Dan Alistarh, Sean Lie, Mark Kurtz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their size creates computational bottlenecks. We introduce a novel approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70% sparsity. We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset. We exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that closely matches theoretical scaling. In addition, we establish inference acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine. The above gains are realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use of quantization. Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x. We demonstrate these results across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality. This work paves the way for rapidly creating smaller and faster LLMs without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating radiology reports is a challenging problem as factual correctness is extremely important due to the need for accurate medical communication about medical images. Existing automatic evaluation metrics either suffer from failing to consider factual correctness (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or are limited in their interpretability (e.g., F1CheXpert and F1RadGraph). In this paper, we introduce GREEN (Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation), a radiology report generation metric that leverages the natural language understanding of language models to identify and explain clinically significant errors in candidate reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared to current metrics, GREEN offers: 1) a score aligned with expert preferences, 2) human interpretable explanations of clinically significant errors, enabling feedback loops with end-users, and 3) a lightweight open-source method that reaches the performance of commercial counterparts. We validate our GREEN metric by comparing it to GPT-4, as well as to error counts of 6 experts and preferences of 2 experts. Our method demonstrates not only higher correlation with expert error counts, but simultaneously higher alignment with expert preferences when compared to previous approaches."</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vlad-Andrei Cursaru, Laura Duits, Joel Milligan, Damla Ural, Berta Rodriguez Sanchez, Vincenzo Stoico, Ivano Malavolta</p>
<p>Abstract: Context. Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development. Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software. However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools. Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.
  Goal. In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.
  Method. We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python. We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures. Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.
  Results. Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand. Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart. Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code.
  Conclusions. According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so. Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.</p>

<p>Abstract: As cyber threats and malware attacks increasingly alarm both individuals and businesses, the urgency for proactive malware countermeasures intensifies. This has driven a rising interest in automated machine learning solutions. Transformers, a cutting-edge category of attention-based deep learning methods, have demonstrated remarkable success. In this paper, we present BERTroid, an innovative malware detection model built on the BERT architecture. Overall, BERTroid emerged as a promising solution for combating Android malware. Its ability to outperform state-of-the-art solutions demonstrates its potential as a proactive defense mechanism against malicious software attacks. Additionally, we evaluate BERTroid on multiple datasets to assess its performance across diverse scenarios. In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, our approach has demonstrated promising resilience against the rapid evolution of malware on Android systems. While the machine learning model captures broad patterns, we emphasize the role of manual validation for deeper comprehension and insight into these behaviors. This human intervention is critical for discerning intricate and context-specific behaviors, thereby validating and reinforcing the model's findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues across various fields, including cybersecurity, which faces an ever-evolving threat landscape and need for innovative technologies. Despite initial explorations into the application of LLMs in cybersecurity, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of this research area. This paper bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review, encompassing an analysis of over 180 works, spanning across 25 LLMs and more than 10 downstream scenarios. Our comprehensive overview addresses three critical research questions: the construction of cybersecurity-oriented LLMs, LLMs' applications in various cybersecurity tasks, and the existing challenges and further research in this area. This study aims to shed light on the extensive potential of LLMs in enhancing cybersecurity practices, and serve as a valuable resource for applying LLMs in this doamin.

<p>Abstract: To demonstrate and address the underlying maliciousness, we propose a theoretical hypothesis and analytical approach, and introduce a new black-box jailbreak attack methodology named IntentObfuscator, exploiting this identified flaw by obfuscating the true intentions behind user prompts.This approach compels LLMs to inadvertently generate restricted content, bypassing their built-in content security measures. We detail two implementations under this framework: "Obscure Intention" and "Create Ambiguity", which manipulate query complexity and ambiguity to evade malicious intent detection effectively. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the IntentObfuscator method across several models, including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Qwen and Baichuan, achieving an average jailbreak success rate of 69.21\%. Notably, our tests on ChatGPT-3.5, which claims 100 million weekly active users, achieved a remarkable success rate of 83.65\%. We also extend our validation to diverse types of sensitive content like graphic violence, racism, sexism, political sensitivity, cybersecurity threats, and criminal skills, further proving the substantial impact of our findings on enhancing 'Red Team' strategies against LLM content security frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpit Bahety, Priyanka Mandikal, Ben Abbatematteo, Roberto Mart\'in-Mart\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is a longstanding challenge in robotics due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the strict spatial and temporal synchronization required to generate meaningful behavior. Humans learn bimanual manipulation skills by watching other humans and by refining their abilities through play. In this work, we aim to enable robots to learn bimanual manipulation behaviors from human video demonstrations and fine-tune them through interaction. Inspired by seminal work in psychology and biomechanics, we propose modeling the interaction between two hands as a serial kinematic linkage -- as a screw motion, in particular, that we use to define a new action space for bimanual manipulation: screw actions. We introduce ScrewMimic, a framework that leverages this novel action representation to facilitate learning from human demonstration and self-supervised policy fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that ScrewMimic is able to learn several complex bimanual behaviors from a single human video demonstration, and that it outperforms baselines that interpret demonstrations and fine-tune directly in the original space of motion of both arms.

<p>Abstract: As automation advances in manufacturing, the demand for precise and sophisticated defect detection technologies grows. Existing vision models for defect recognition methods are insufficient for handling the complexities and variations of defects in contemporary manufacturing settings. These models especially struggle in scenarios involving limited or imbalanced defect data. In this work, we introduce MemoryMamba, a novel memory-augmented state space model (SSM), designed to overcome the limitations of existing defect recognition models. MemoryMamba integrates the state space model with the memory augmentation mechanism, enabling the system to maintain and retrieve essential defect-specific information in training. Its architecture is designed to capture dependencies and intricate defect characteristics, which are crucial for effective defect detection. In the experiments, MemoryMamba was evaluated across four industrial datasets with diverse defect types and complexities. The model consistently outperformed other methods, demonstrating its capability to adapt to various defect recognition scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown incredible capabilities in a variety of 2D vision and language tasks. We extend MLLMs' perceptual capabilities to ground and reason about images in 3-dimensional space. To that end, we first develop a large-scale pre-training dataset for 2D and 3D called LV3D by combining multiple existing 2D and 3D recognition datasets under a common task formulation: as multi-turn question-answering. Next, we introduce a new MLLM named Cube-LLM and pre-train it on LV3D. We show that pure data scaling makes a strong 3D perception capability without 3D specific architectural design or training objective. Cube-LLM exhibits intriguing properties similar to LLMs: (1) Cube-LLM can apply chain-of-thought prompting to improve 3D understanding from 2D context information. (2) Cube-LLM can follow complex and diverse instructions and adapt to versatile input and output formats. (3) Cube-LLM can be visually prompted such as 2D box or a set of candidate 3D boxes from specialists. Our experiments on outdoor benchmarks demonstrate that Cube-LLM significantly outperforms existing baselines by 21.3 points of AP-BEV on the Talk2Car dataset for 3D grounded reasoning and 17.7 points on the DriveLM dataset for complex reasoning about driving scenarios, respectively. Cube-LLM also shows competitive results in general MLLM benchmarks such as refCOCO for 2D grounding with (87.0) average score, as well as visual question answering benchmarks such as VQAv2, GQA, SQA, POPE, etc. for complex reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Franzmeyer, Stephen McAleer, Jo\~ao F. Henriques, Jakob N. Foerster, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi, Christian Schroeder de Witt</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents deployed in the real world need to be robust against adversarial attacks on sensory inputs. Robustifying agent policies requires anticipating the strongest attacks possible. We demonstrate that existing observation-space attacks on reinforcement learning agents have a common weakness: while effective, their lack of information-theoretic detectability constraints makes them detectable using automated means or human inspection. Detectability is undesirable to adversaries as it may trigger security escalations. We introduce {\epsilon}-illusory, a novel form of adversarial attack on sequential decision-makers that is both effective and of {\epsilon}-bounded statistical detectability. We propose a novel dual ascent algorithm to learn such attacks end-to-end. Compared to existing attacks, we empirically find {\epsilon}-illusory to be significantly harder to detect with automated methods, and a small study with human participants (IRB approval under reference R84123/RE001) suggests they are similarly harder to detect for humans. Our findings suggest the need for better anomaly detectors, as well as effective hardware- and system-level defenses. The project website can be found at https://tinyurl.com/illusory-attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most exploration research on reinforcement learning (RL) has paid attention to `the way of exploration', which is `how to explore'. The other exploration research, `when to explore', has not been the main focus of RL exploration research. The issue of `when' of a monolithic exploration in the usual RL exploration behaviour binds an exploratory action to an exploitational action of an agent. Recently, a non-monolithic exploration research has emerged to examine the mode-switching exploration behaviour of humans and animals. The ultimate purpose of our research is to enable an agent to decide when to explore or exploit autonomously. We describe the initial research of an autonomous multi-mode exploration of non-monolithic behaviour in an options framework. The higher performance of our method is shown against the existing non-monolithic exploration method through comparative experimental results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Staab, Mark Vero, Mislav Balunovi\'c, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models' inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals' privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to $85\%$ top-1 and $95\%$ top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost ($100\times$) and time ($240\times$) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joy He-Yueya, Noah D. Goodman, Emma Brunskill</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating effective educational materials generally requires expensive and time-consuming studies of student learning outcomes. To overcome this barrier, one idea is to build computational models of student learning and use them to optimize instructional materials. However, it is difficult to model the cognitive processes of learning dynamics. We propose an alternative approach that uses Language Models (LMs) as educational experts to assess the impact of various instructions on learning outcomes. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5 to evaluate the overall effect of instructional materials on different student groups and find that it can replicate well-established educational findings such as the Expertise Reversal Effect and the Variability Effect. This demonstrates the potential of LMs as reliable evaluators of educational content. Building on this insight, we introduce an instruction optimization approach in which one LM generates instructional materials using the judgments of another LM as a reward function. We apply this approach to create math word problem worksheets aimed at maximizing student learning gains. Human teachers' evaluations of these LM-generated worksheets show a significant alignment between the LM judgments and human teacher preferences. We conclude by discussing potential divergences between human and LM opinions and the resulting pitfalls of automating instructional design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous virtual agents are often limited by their singular mode of interaction with real-world environments, restricting their versatility. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Agent Collaboration framework (MMAC-Copilot), a framework utilizes the collective expertise of diverse agents to enhance interaction ability with operating systems. The framework introduces a team collaboration chain, enabling each participating agent to contribute insights based on their specific domain knowledge, effectively reducing the hallucination associated with knowledge domain gaps. To evaluate the performance of MMAC-Copilot, we conducted experiments using both the GAIA benchmark and our newly introduced Visual Interaction Benchmark (VIBench). VIBench focuses on non-API-interactable applications across various domains, including 3D gaming, recreation, and office scenarios. MMAC-Copilot achieved exceptional performance on GAIA, with an average improvement of 6.8\% over existing leading systems. Furthermore, it demonstrated remarkable capability on VIBench, particularly in managing various methods of interaction within systems and applications. These results underscore MMAC-Copilot's potential in advancing the field of autonomous virtual agents through its innovative approach to agent collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Zhou, Zhiguang Cao, Yaoxin Wu, Wen Song, Yining Ma, Jie Zhang, Chi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has garnered much attention. However, most neural solvers are only structured and trained independently on a specific problem, making them less generic and practical. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified neural solver that can cope with a range of VRP variants simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. We further develop a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE, delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity. Experimentally, our method significantly promotes zero-shot generalization performance on 10 unseen VRP variants, and showcases decent results on the few-shot setting and real-world benchmark instances. We further conduct extensive studies on the effect of MoE configurations in solving VRPs, and observe the superiority of hierarchical gating when facing out-of-distribution data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengfan Xu, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the challenging exploration incentive problem in both bandit and reinforcement learning, where the rewards are scale-free and potentially unbounded, driven by real-world scenarios and differing from existing work. Past works in reinforcement learning either assume costly interactions with an environment or propose algorithms finding potentially low quality local maxima. Motivated by EXP-type methods that integrate multiple agents (experts) for exploration in bandits with the assumption that rewards are bounded, we propose new algorithms, namely EXP4.P and EXP4-RL for exploration in the unbounded reward case, and demonstrate their effectiveness in these new settings. Unbounded rewards introduce challenges as the regret cannot be limited by the number of trials, and selecting suboptimal arms may lead to infinite regret. Specifically, we establish EXP4.P's regret upper bounds in both bounded and unbounded linear and stochastic contextual bandits. Surprisingly, we also find that by including one sufficiently competent expert, EXP4.P can achieve global optimality in the linear case. This unbounded reward result is also applicable to a revised version of EXP3.P in the Multi-armed Bandit scenario. In EXP4-RL, we extend EXP4.P from bandit scenarios to reinforcement learning to incentivize exploration by multiple agents, including one high-performing agent, for both efficiency and excellence. This algorithm has been tested on difficult-to-explore games and shows significant improvements in exploration compared to state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Yang, Zhibo Zhang, Zhengfu He, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: As details are missing in most representations of structures, the lack of controllability to more information is one of the major weaknesses in structure-based controllable point cloud generation. It is observable that definitions of details and structures are subjective. Details can be treated as structures on small scales. To represent structures in different scales at the same time, we present a graph-based representation of structures called the Multiscale Structure Graph (MSG). Given structures in multiple scales, similar patterns of local structures can be found at different scales, positions, and angles. The knowledge learned from a regional structure pattern shall be transferred to other similar patterns. An encoding and generation mechanism, namely the Multiscale Structure-based Point Cloud Generator (MSPCG) is proposed, which can simultaneously learn point cloud generation from local patterns with miscellaneous spatial properties. The proposed method supports multiscale editions on point clouds by editing the MSG. By generating point clouds from local structures and learning simultaneously in multiple scales, our MSPCG has better generalization ability and scalability. Trained on the ShapeNet, our MSPCG can generate point clouds from a given structure for unseen categories and indoor scenes. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ozan \"Ozdemir, Matthias Kerzel, Cornelius Weber, Jae Hee Lee, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: Human infants learn language while interacting with their environment in which their caregivers may describe the objects and actions they perform. Similar to human infants, artificial agents can learn language while interacting with their environment. In this work, first, we present a neural model that bidirectionally binds robot actions and their language descriptions in a simple object manipulation scenario. Building on our previous Paired Variational Autoencoders (PVAE) model, we demonstrate the superiority of the variational autoencoder over standard autoencoders by experimenting with cubes of different colours, and by enabling the production of alternative vocabularies. Additional experiments show that the model's channel-separated visual feature extraction module can cope with objects of different shapes. Next, we introduce PVAE-BERT, which equips the model with a pretrained large-scale language model, i.e., Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), enabling the model to go beyond comprehending only the predefined descriptions that the network has been trained on; the recognition of action descriptions generalises to unconstrained natural language as the model becomes capable of understanding unlimited variations of the same descriptions. Our experiments suggest that using a pretrained language model as the language encoder allows our approach to scale up for real-world scenarios with instructions from human users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongkwan Kim, Alice Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has emerged as an important problem, but it is by default approached with specialized graph neural networks on a large global graph. These models demand extensive memory and computational resources but challenge modeling hierarchical structures of subgraphs. In this paper, we propose Subgraph-To-Node (S2N) translation, a novel formulation for learning representations of subgraphs. Specifically, given a set of subgraphs in the global graph, we construct a new graph by coarsely transforming subgraphs into nodes. Demonstrating both theoretical and empirical evidence, S2N not only significantly reduces memory and computational costs compared to state-of-the-art models but also outperforms them by capturing both local and global structures of the subgraph. By leveraging graph coarsening methods, our method outperforms baselines even in a data-scarce setting with insufficient subgraphs. Our experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate that fined-tuned models with S2N translation can process 183 -- 711 times more subgraph samples than state-of-the-art models at a better or similar performance level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Hassanin, Saeed Anwar, Ibrahim Radwan, Fahad S Khan, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the human cognitive system, attention is a mechanism that imitates the human cognitive awareness about specific information, amplifying critical details to focus more on the essential aspects of data. Deep learning has employed attention to boost performance for many applications. Interestingly, the same attention design can suit processing different data modalities and can easily be incorporated into large networks. Furthermore, multiple complementary attention mechanisms can be incorporated into one network. Hence, attention techniques have become extremely attractive. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey on attention techniques to guide researchers in employing attention in their deep models. Note that, besides being demanding in terms of training data and computational resources, transformers only cover a single category in self-attention out of the many categories available. We fill this gap and provide an in-depth survey of 50 attention techniques, categorizing them by their most prominent features. We initiate our discussion by introducing the fundamental concepts behind the success of the attention mechanism. Next, we furnish some essentials such as the strengths and limitations of each attention category, describe their fundamental building blocks, basic formulations with primary usage, and applications specifically for computer vision. We also discuss the challenges and general open questions related to attention mechanisms. Finally, we recommend possible future research directions for deep attention.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Yang, Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, James C Kerce, Faramarz Fekri</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive logic reasoning is a fundamental task in graph analysis, which aims to generalize patterns from data. This task has been extensively studied for traditional graph representations, such as knowledge graphs (KGs), using techniques like inductive logic programming (ILP). Existing ILP methods assume learning from KGs with static facts and binary relations. Beyond KGs, graph structures are widely present in other applications such as procedural instructions, scene graphs, and program executions. While ILP is beneficial for these applications, applying it to those graphs is nontrivial: they are more complex than KGs, which usually involve timestamps and n-ary relations, effectively a type of hypergraph with temporal events. In this work, we propose temporal inductive logic reasoning (TILR), an ILP method that reasons on temporal hypergraphs. To enable hypergraph reasoning, we introduce the multi-start random B-walk, a novel graph traversal method for hypergraphs. By combining it with a path-consistency algorithm, TILR learns logic rules by generalizing from both temporal and relational data. To address the lack of hypergraph benchmarks, we create and release two temporal hypergraph datasets: YouCook2-HG and nuScenes-HG. Experiments on these benchmarks demonstrate that TILR achieves superior reasoning capability over various strong baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The class of deep deterministic off-policy algorithms is effectively applied to solve challenging continuous control problems. Current approaches commonly utilize random noise as an exploration method, which has several drawbacks, including the need for manual adjustment for a given task and the absence of exploratory calibration during the training process. We address these challenges by proposing a novel guided exploration method that uses an ensemble of Monte Carlo Critics for calculating exploratory action correction. The proposed method enhances the traditional exploration scheme by dynamically adjusting exploration. Subsequently, we present a novel algorithm that leverages the proposed exploratory module for both policy and critic modification. The presented algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to modern reinforcement learning algorithms across a variety of problems in the DMControl suite.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Han, Jielin Qiu, Jiacheng Zhu, Mengdi Xu, Douglas Weber, Bo Li, Ding Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain Signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG), and human languages have been widely explored independently for many downstream tasks, however, the connection between them has not been well explored. In this study, we explore the relationship and dependency between EEG and language. To study at the representation level, we introduced \textbf{MTAM}, a \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{M}odel, to observe coordinated representations between the two modalities. We used various relationship alignment-seeking techniques, such as Canonical Correlation Analysis and Wasserstein Distance, as loss functions to transfigure features. On downstream applications, sentiment analysis and relation detection, we achieved new state-of-the-art results on two datasets, ZuCo and K-EmoCon. Our method achieved an F1-score improvement of 1.7% on K-EmoCon and 9.3% on Zuco datasets for sentiment analysis, and 7.4% on ZuCo for relation detection. In addition, we provide interpretations of the performance improvement: (1) feature distribution shows the effectiveness of the alignment module for discovering and encoding the relationship between EEG and language; (2) alignment weights show the influence of different language semantics as well as EEG frequency features; (3) brain topographical maps provide an intuitive demonstration of the connectivity in the brain regions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhee Kim, Taesung Kim, Taewoo Kim, Jaegul Choo, Dong-Wook Kim, Byungduk Ahn, In-Seok Song, Yoon-Ji Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Diagnosis based on medical images, such as X-ray images, often involves manual annotation of anatomical keypoints. However, this process involves significant human efforts and can thus be a bottleneck in the diagnostic process. To fully automate this procedure, deep-learning-based methods have been widely proposed and have achieved high performance in detecting keypoints in medical images. However, these methods still have clinical limitations: accuracy cannot be guaranteed for all cases, and it is necessary for doctors to double-check all predictions of models. In response, we propose a novel deep neural network that, given an X-ray image, automatically detects and refines the anatomical keypoints through a user-interactive system in which doctors can fix mispredicted keypoints with fewer clicks than needed during manual revision. Using our own collected data and the publicly available AASCE dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the annotation costs via extensive quantitative and qualitative results. A demo video of our approach is available on our project webpage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sherif Abdulatif, Ruizhe Cao, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we further develop the conformer-based metric generative adversarial network (CMGAN) model for speech enhancement (SE) in the time-frequency (TF) domain. This paper builds on our previous work but takes a more in-depth look by conducting extensive ablation studies on model inputs and architectural design choices. We rigorously tested the generalization ability of the model to unseen noise types and distortions. We have fortified our claims through DNS-MOS measurements and listening tests. Rather than focusing exclusively on the speech denoising task, we extend this work to address the dereverberation and super-resolution tasks. This necessitated exploring various architectural changes, specifically metric discriminator scores and masking techniques. It is essential to highlight that this is among the earliest works that attempted complex TF-domain super-resolution. Our findings show that CMGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in the three major speech enhancement tasks: denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution. For example, in the denoising task using the Voice Bank+DEMAND dataset, CMGAN notably exceeded the performance of prior models, attaining a PESQ score of 3.41 and an SSNR of 11.10 dB. Audio samples and CMGAN implementations are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoliang Lin, Hanjiang Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning with $N$-way $K$-shot scheme is an open challenge in machine learning. Many metric-based approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, e.g., the Matching Networks and CLIP-Adapter. Despite that these approaches have shown significant progress, the mechanism of why these methods succeed has not been well explored. In this paper, we try to interpret these metric-based few-shot learning methods via causal mechanism. We show that the existing approaches can be viewed as specific forms of front-door adjustment, which can alleviate the effect of spurious correlations and thus learn the causality. This causal interpretation could provide us a new perspective to better understand these existing metric-based methods. Further, based on this causal interpretation, we simply introduce two causal methods for metric-based few-shot learning, which considers not only the relationship between examples but also the diversity of representations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods in few-shot classification on various benchmark datasets. Code is available in https://github.com/lingl1024/causalFewShot.</p>

Even with abundant data, current inverse reinforcement learning methods that focus on learning from a single environment can fail to handle slight changes in the environment dynamics. We tackle these challenges through adaptive environment design. In our framework, the learner repeatedly interacts with the expert, with the former selecting environments to identify the reward function as quickly as possible from the expert's demonstrations in said environments. This results in improvements in both sample-efficiency and robustness, as we show experimentally, for both exact and approximate inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum optimization, a key application of quantum computing, has traditionally been stymied by the linearly increasing complexity of gradient calculations with an increasing number of parameters. This work bridges the gap between Koopman operator theory, which has found utility in applications because it allows for a linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems, and natural gradient methods in quantum optimization, leading to a significant acceleration of gradient-based quantum optimization. We present Quantum-circuit Alternating Controlled Koopman learning (QuACK), a novel framework that leverages an alternating algorithm for efficient prediction of gradient dynamics on quantum computers. We demonstrate QuACK's remarkable ability to accelerate gradient-based optimization across a range of applications in quantum optimization and machine learning. In fact, our empirical studies, spanning quantum chemistry, quantum condensed matter, quantum machine learning, and noisy environments, have shown accelerations of more than 200x speedup in the overparameterized regime, 10x speedup in the smooth regime, and 3x speedup in the non-smooth regime. With QuACK, we offer a robust advancement that harnesses the advantage of gradient-based quantum optimization for practical benefits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David M. Bossens, Philip S. Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: In many domains, the exploration process of reinforcement learning will be too costly as it requires trying out suboptimal policies, resulting in a need for off-policy evaluation, in which a target policy is evaluated based on data collected from a known behaviour policy. In this context, importance sampling estimators provide estimates for the expected return by weighting the trajectory based on the probability ratio of the target policy and the behaviour policy. Unfortunately, such estimators have a high variance and therefore a large mean squared error. This paper proposes state-based importance sampling estimators which reduce the variance by dropping certain states from the computation of the importance weight. To illustrate their applicability, we demonstrate state-based variants of ordinary importance sampling, weighted importance sampling, per-decision importance sampling, incremental importance sampling, doubly robust off-policy evaluation, and stationary density ratio estimation. Experiments in four domains show that state-based methods consistently yield reduced variance and improved accuracy compared to their traditional counterparts.</p>

<p>Abstract: An open problem in differentially private deep learning is hyperparameter optimization (HPO). DP-SGD introduces new hyperparameters and complicates existing ones, forcing researchers to painstakingly tune hyperparameters with hundreds of trials, which in turn makes it impossible to account for the privacy cost of HPO without destroying the utility. We propose an adaptive HPO method that uses cheap trials (in terms of privacy cost and runtime) to estimate optimal hyperparameters and scales them up. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on 22 benchmark tasks, across computer vision and natural language processing, across pretraining and finetuning, across architectures and a wide range of $\varepsilon \in [0.01,8.0]$, all while accounting for the privacy cost of HPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhil Agnihotri, Rahul Jain, Haipeng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for constrained MDPs (CMDPs) is an increasingly important problem for various applications. Often, the average criterion is more suitable than the discounted criterion. Yet, RL for average-CMDPs (ACMDPs) remains a challenging problem. Algorithms designed for discounted constrained RL problems often do not perform well for the average CMDP setting. In this paper, we introduce a new policy optimization with function approximation algorithm for constrained MDPs with the average criterion. The Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm is inspired by trust region-based policy optimization algorithms. We develop basic sensitivity theory for average CMDPs, and then use the corresponding bounds in the design of the algorithm. We provide theoretical guarantees on its performance, and through extensive experimental work in various challenging OpenAI Gym environments, show its superior empirical performance when compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms adapted for the ACMDPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhe Zhang, Yan Sun, Jinyu Cai, Jicong Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Many well-known and effective anomaly detection methods assume that a reasonable decision boundary has a hypersphere shape, which however is difficult to obtain in practice and is not sufficiently compact, especially when the data are in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we first propose a novel deep anomaly detection model that improves the original hypersphere learning through an orthogonal projection layer, which ensures that the training data distribution is consistent with the hypersphere hypothesis, thereby increasing the true positive rate and decreasing the false negative rate. Moreover, we propose a bi-hypersphere compression method to obtain a hyperspherical shell that yields a more compact decision region than a hyperball, which is demonstrated theoretically and numerically. The proposed methods are not confined to common datasets such as image and tabular data, but are also extended to a more challenging but promising scenario, graph-level anomaly detection, which learns graph representation with maximum mutual information between the substructure and global structure features while exploring orthogonal single- or bi-hypersphere anomaly decision boundaries. The numerical and visualization results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods in comparison to many baselines and state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Lamparth, Anka Reuel</p>
<p>Abstract: Poisoning of data sets is a potential security threat to large language models that can lead to backdoored models. A description of the internal mechanisms of backdoored language models and how they process trigger inputs, e.g., when switching to toxic language, has yet to be found. In this work, we study the internal representations of transformer-based backdoored language models and determine early-layer MLP modules as most important for the backdoor mechanism in combination with the initial embedding projection. We use this knowledge to remove, insert, and modify backdoor mechanisms with engineered replacements that reduce the MLP module outputs to essentials for the backdoor mechanism. To this end, we introduce PCP ablation, where we replace transformer modules with low-rank matrices based on the principal components of their activations. We demonstrate our results on backdoored toy, backdoored large, and non-backdoored open-source models. We show that we can improve the backdoor robustness of large language models by locally constraining individual modules during fine-tuning on potentially poisonous data sets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiwei Xuan, Ziquan Deng, Hsuan-Tien Lin, Zhaodan Kong, Kwan-Liu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have proposed various methods for visually interpreting the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) via saliency maps, which include Class-Activation-Map (CAM) based approaches as a leading family. However, in terms of the internal design logic, existing CAM-based approaches often overlook the causal perspective that answers the core "why" question to help humans understand the explanation. Additionally, current CNN explanations lack the consideration of both necessity and sufficiency, two complementary sides of a desirable explanation. This paper presents a causality-driven framework, SUNY, designed to rationalize the explanations toward better human understanding. Using the CNN model's input features or internal filters as hypothetical causes, SUNY generates explanations by bi-directional quantifications on both the necessary and sufficient perspectives. Extensive evaluations justify that SUNY not only produces more informative and convincing explanations from the angles of necessity and sufficiency, but also achieves performances competitive to other approaches across different CNN architectures over large-scale datasets, including ILSVRC2012 and CUB-200-2011.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Salhab, Haidar Harmanani</p>
<p>Abstract: Spoken keyword spotting (KWS) is the task of identifying a keyword in an audio stream and is widely used in smart devices at the edge in order to activate voice assistants and perform hands-free tasks. The task is daunting as there is a need, on the one hand, to achieve high accuracy while at the same time ensuring that such systems continue to run efficiently on low power and possibly limited computational capabilities devices. This work presents AraSpot for Arabic keyword spotting trained on 40 Arabic keywords, using different online data augmentation, and introducing ConformerGRU model architecture. Finally, we further improve the performance of the model by training a text-to-speech model for synthetic data generation. AraSpot achieved a State-of-the-Art SOTA 99.59% result outperforming previous approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihan Yang, Runyu Ding, Weipeng Deng, Zhe Wang, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a lightweight and scalable Regional Point-Language Contrastive learning framework, namely \textbf{RegionPLC}, for open-world 3D scene understanding, aiming to identify and recognize open-set objects and categories. Specifically, based on our empirical studies, we introduce a 3D-aware SFusion strategy that fuses 3D vision-language pairs derived from multiple 2D foundation models, yielding high-quality, dense region-level language descriptions without human 3D annotations. Subsequently, we devise a region-aware point-discriminative contrastive learning objective to enable robust and effective 3D learning from dense regional language supervision. We carry out extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes datasets, and our model outperforms prior 3D open-world scene understanding approaches by an average of 17.2\% and 9.1\% for semantic and instance segmentation, respectively, while maintaining greater scalability and lower resource demands. Furthermore, our method has the flexibility to be effortlessly integrated with language models to enable open-ended grounded 3D reasoning without extra task-specific training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiushi Sun, Chengcheng Han, Nuo Chen, Renyu Zhu, Jingyang Gong, Xiang Li, Ming Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing power on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, tuning these models for downstream tasks usually needs exorbitant costs or is unavailable due to commercial considerations. Recently, black-box tuning has been proposed to address this problem by optimizing task-specific prompts without accessing the gradients and hidden representations. However, most existing works have yet fully exploited the potential of gradient-free optimization under the scenario of few-shot learning. In this paper, we describe BBT-RGB, a suite of straightforward and complementary techniques for enhancing the efficiency and performance of black-box optimization. Specifically, our method includes three plug-and-play components: (1) Two-stage derivative-free optimization strategy that facilitates fast convergence and mitigates overfitting; (2) Automatic verbalizer construction with its novel usage under few-shot settings; (3) Better prompt initialization policy based on instruction search and auto-selected demonstration. Extensive experiments across various tasks on natural language understanding and inference demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Dehghani, Heshaam Faili</p>
<p>Abstract: Spelling correction is a remarkable challenge in the field of natural language processing. The objective of spelling correction tasks is to recognize and rectify spelling errors automatically. The development of applications that can effectually diagnose and correct Persian spelling and grammatical errors has become more important in order to improve the quality of Persian text. The Typographical Error Type Detection in Persian is a relatively understudied area. Therefore, this paper presents a compelling approach for detecting typographical errors in Persian texts. Our work includes the presentation of a publicly available dataset called FarsTypo, which comprises 3.4 million words arranged in chronological order and tagged with their corresponding part-of-speech. These words cover a wide range of topics and linguistic styles. We develop an algorithm designed to apply Persian-specific errors to a scalable portion of these words, resulting in a parallel dataset of correct and incorrect words. By leveraging FarsTypo, we establish a strong foundation and conduct a thorough comparison of various methodologies employing different architectures. Additionally, we introduce a groundbreaking Deep Sequential Neural Network that utilizes both word and character embeddings, along with bidirectional LSTM layers, for token classification aimed at detecting typographical errors across 51 distinct classes. Our approach is contrasted with highly advanced industrial systems that, unlike this study, have been developed using a diverse range of resources. The outcomes of our final method proved to be highly competitive, achieving an accuracy of 97.62%, precision of 98.83%, recall of 98.61%, and surpassing others in terms of speed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and addressing unfairness in LLMs are crucial for responsible AI deployment. However, there is a limited number of quantitative analyses and in-depth studies regarding fairness evaluations in LLMs, especially when applying LLMs to high-stakes fields. This work aims to fill this gap by providing a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness and fairness of LLMs using ChatGPT as a study case. We focus on assessing ChatGPT's performance in high-takes fields including education, criminology, finance and healthcare. To conduct a thorough evaluation, we consider both group fairness and individual fairness metrics. We also observe the disparities in ChatGPT's outputs under a set of biased or unbiased prompts. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' fairness performance, facilitates bias mitigation and fosters the development of responsible AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessy Lin, Nicholas Tomlin, Jacob Andreas, Jason Eisner</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe a class of tasks called decision-oriented dialogues, in which AI assistants such as large language models (LMs) must collaborate with one or more humans via natural language to help them make complex decisions. We formalize three domains in which users face everyday decisions: (1) choosing an assignment of reviewers to conference papers, (2) planning a multi-step itinerary in a city, and (3) negotiating travel plans for a group of friends. In each of these settings, AI assistants and users have disparate abilities that they must combine to arrive at the best decision: assistants can access and process large amounts of information, while users have preferences and constraints external to the system. For each task, we build a dialogue environment where agents receive a reward based on the quality of the final decision they reach. We evaluate LMs in self-play and in collaboration with humans and find that they fall short compared to human assistants, achieving much lower rewards despite engaging in longer dialogues. We highlight a number of challenges models face in decision-oriented dialogues, ranging from goal-directed behavior to reasoning and optimization, and release our environments as a testbed for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kacper Sokol, Edward Small, Yueqing Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are the de facto standard when tasked with interpreting decisions of (opaque) predictive models. Their generation is often subject to algorithmic and domain-specific constraints -- such as density-based feasibility, and attribute (im)mutability or directionality of change -- that aim to maximise their real-life utility. In addition to desiderata with respect to the counterfactual instance itself, existence of a viable path connecting it with the factual data point, known as algorithmic recourse, has become an important technical consideration. While both of these requirements ensure that the steps of the journey as well as its destination are admissible, current literature neglects the multiplicity of such counterfactual paths. To address this shortcoming we introduce the novel concept of explanatory multiverse that encompasses all the possible counterfactual journeys. We then show how to navigate, reason about and compare the geometry of these trajectories with two methods: vector spaces and graphs. To this end, we overview their spacial properties -- such as affinity, branching, divergence and possible future convergence -- and propose an all-in-one metric, called opportunity potential, to quantify them. Implementing this (possibly interactive) explanatory process grants explainees agency by allowing them to select counterfactuals based on the properties of the journey leading to them in addition to their absolute differences. We show the flexibility, benefit and efficacy of such an approach through examples and quantitative evaluation on the German Credit and MNIST data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Cundy, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: In many domains, autoregressive models can attain high likelihood on the task of predicting the next observation. However, this maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective does not necessarily match a downstream use-case of autoregressively generating high-quality sequences. The MLE objective weights sequences proportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance for the model's behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding error during autoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding error problem, we formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL) problem. This allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the distribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences from a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences. The IL framework also allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process. This further mitigates the compounding error problem by allowing the model to revert a sampled token if it takes the sequence OOD. Our resulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented without adversarial training or architectural changes. We identify the SequenceMatch-$\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for autoregressive models which are used for generation. We show that empirically, SequenceMatch training leads to improvements over MLE on text generation with language models and arithmetic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Various industries such as finance, meteorology, and energy produce vast amounts of heterogeneous data every day. There is a natural demand for humans to manage, process, and display data efficiently. However, it necessitates labor-intensive efforts and a high level of expertise for these data-related tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) showcase promising capabilities in semantic understanding and reasoning, we advocate that the deployment of LLMs could autonomously manage and process massive amounts of data while interacting and displaying in a human-friendly manner. Based on this, we propose Data-Copilot, an LLM-based system that connects numerous data sources on one end and caters to diverse human demands on the other end. Acting as an experienced expert, Data-Copilot autonomously transforms raw data into multi-form output that best matches the user's intent. Specifically, it first designs multiple universal interfaces to satisfy diverse data-related requests, like querying, analysis, prediction, and visualization. In real-time response, it automatically deploys a concise workflow by invoking corresponding interfaces. The whole process is fully controlled by Data-Copilot, without human assistance. We release Data-Copilot-1.0 using massive Chinese financial data, e.g., stocks, funds, and news. Experiments indicate it achieves reliable performance with lower token consumption, showing promising application prospects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjie Sun, Zhuang Liu, Anna Bair, J. Zico Kolter</p>
<p>Abstract: As their size increases, Large Languages Models (LLMs) are natural candidates for network pruning methods: approaches that drop a subset of network weights while striving to preserve performance. Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhe Diao, Rui Pan, Hanze Dong, Ka Shun Shum, Jipeng Zhang, Wei Xiong, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a great ability to achieve general human-level intelligence far beyond traditional approaches. As the technique keeps attracting attention from the AI community, an increasing number of foundation models are becoming publicly accessible. However, a significant shortcoming of most of these models lies in their performance in specialized-domain and task-specific applications, necessitating domain- and task-aware fine-tuning to develop effective scientific language models. As the number of available foundation models and specialized tasks keeps growing, the job of training scientific language models becomes highly nontrivial. In this paper, we initiate steps to tackle this issue. We introduce an extensible and lightweight toolkit, LMFlow, which aims to simplify the domain- and task-aware finetuning of general foundation models. LMFlow offers a complete finetuning workflow for a foundation model to support specialized training with limited computing resources. Furthermore, it supports continuous pretraining, instruction tuning, parameter-efficient finetuning, alignment tuning, inference acceleration, long context generalization, model customization, and even multimodal finetuning, along with carefully designed and extensible APIs. This toolkit has been thoroughly tested and is available at https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred discussions about their potential to enhance quantitative trading strategies. LLMs excel in analyzing sentiments about listed companies from financial news, providing critical insights for trading decisions. However, the performance of LLMs in this task varies substantially due to their inherent characteristics. This paper introduces a standardized experimental procedure for comprehensive evaluations. We detail the methodology using three distinct LLMs, each embodying a unique approach to performance enhancement, applied specifically to the task of sentiment factor extraction from large volumes of Chinese news summaries. Subsequently, we develop quantitative trading strategies using these sentiment factors and conduct back-tests in realistic scenarios. Our results will offer perspectives about the performances of Large Language Models applied to extracting sentiments from Chinese news texts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be "helpful and harmless." These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study adversarial alignment, and ask to what extent these models remain aligned when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs.
  However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruta Binkyte, Daniele Gorla, Catuscia Palamidessi</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of unfair discrimination between two groups and propose a pre-processing method to achieve fairness. Corrective methods like statistical parity usually lead to bad accuracy and do not really achieve fairness in situations where there is a correlation between the sensitive attribute S and the legitimate attribute E (explanatory variable) that should determine the decision. To overcome these drawbacks, other notions of fairness have been proposed, in particular, conditional statistical parity and equal opportunity. However, E is often not directly observable in the data, i.e., it is a latent variable. We may observe some other variable Z representing E, but the problem is that Z may also be affected by S, hence Z itself can be biased. To deal with this problem, we propose BaBE (Bayesian Bias Elimination), an approach based on a combination of Bayes inference and the Expectation-Maximization method, to estimate the most likely value of E for a given Z for each group. The decision can then be based directly on the estimated E. We show, by experiments on synthetic and real data sets, that our approach provides a good level of fairness as well as high accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Raedler, Luca Berardinelli, Karolin Winter, Abbas Rahimi, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Background:Technical systems are growing in complexity with more components and functions across various disciplines. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) helps manage this complexity by using models as key artifacts. Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) supported by MDE facilitate modeling. As data generation in product development increases, there's a growing demand for AI algorithms, which can be challenging to implement. Integrating AI algorithms with DSL and MDE can streamline this process. Objective:This study aims to investigate the existing model-driven approaches relying on DSL in support of the engineering of AI software systems to sharpen future research further and define the current state of the art. Method:We conducted a Systemic Literature Review (SLR), collecting papers from five major databases resulting in 1335 candidate studies, eventually retaining 18 primary studies. Each primary study will be evaluated and discussed with respect to the adoption of MDE principles and practices and the phases of AI development support aligned with the stages of the CRISP-DM methodology. Results:The study's findings show that language workbenches are of paramount importance in dealing with all aspects of modeling language development and are leveraged to define DSL explicitly addressing AI concerns. The most prominent AI-related concerns are training and modeling of the AI algorithm, while minor emphasis is given to the time-consuming preparation of the data. Early project phases that support interdisciplinary communication of requirements, e.g., CRISP-DM Business Understanding phase, are rarely reflected. Conclusion:The study found that the use of MDE for AI is still in its early stages, and there is no single tool or method that is widely used. Additionally, current approaches tend to focus on specific stages of development rather than providing support for the entire development process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent months have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment. This demonstrates that using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents, for which we believe our work is one of the first, seems promising and can be applied to optimize other models in the agent architecture to enhance agent performances over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqiang Sun, Daoyuan Wu, Yue Xue, Han Liu, Haijun Wang, Zhengzi Xu, Xiaofei Xie, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart contracts are prone to various vulnerabilities, leading to substantial financial losses over time. Current analysis tools mainly target vulnerabilities with fixed control or data-flow patterns, such as re-entrancy and integer overflow. However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed that about 80% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the lack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring how Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) could aid in detecting logicc vulnerabilities.
  In this paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static analysis for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying solely on GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false positives and is limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a versatile code understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability type into scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities with GPT. To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently recognize key variables and statements, which are then validated by static confirmation. Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects and 3K Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90%) for token contracts and acceptable precision (57.14%) for large projects like Web3Bugs. It effectively detects ground-truth logic vulnerabilities with a recall of over 70%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors. GPTScan is fast and cost-effective, taking an average of 14.39 seconds and 0.01 USD to scan per thousand lines of Solidity code. Moreover, static confirmation helps GPTScan reduce two-thirds of false positives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soubhik Sanyal, Partha Ghosh, Jinlong Yang, Michael J. Black, Justus Thies, Timo Bolkart</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SCULPT, a novel 3D generative model for clothed and textured 3D meshes of humans. Specifically, we devise a deep neural network that learns to represent the geometry and appearance distribution of clothed human bodies. Training such a model is challenging, as datasets of textured 3D meshes for humans are limited in size and accessibility. Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE, as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities, we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes. Specifically, we learn a pose-dependent geometry space from 3D scan data. We represent this as per vertex displacements w.r.t. the SMPL model. Next, we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator. To alleviate entanglement between pose and clothing type, and pose and clothing appearance, we condition both the texture and geometry generators with attribute labels such as clothing types for the geometry, and clothing colors for the texture generator. We automatically generated these conditioning labels for the 2D images based on the visual question answering model BLIP and CLIP. We validate our method on the SCULPT dataset, and compare to state-of-the-art 3D generative models for clothed human bodies. Our code and data can be found at https://sculpt.is.tue.mpg.de.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David M. Bossens</p>
<p>Abstract: The robust constrained Markov decision process (RCMDP) is a recent task-modelling framework for reinforcement learning that incorporates behavioural constraints and that provides robustness to errors in the transition dynamics model through the use of an uncertainty set. Simulating RCMDPs requires computing the worst-case dynamics based on value estimates for each state, an approach which has previously been used in the Robust Constrained Policy Gradient (RCPG). Highlighting potential downsides of RCPG such as not robustifying the full constrained objective and the lack of incremental learning, this paper introduces two algorithms, called RCPG with Robust Lagrangian and Adversarial RCPG. RCPG with Robust Lagrangian modifies RCPG by taking the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian rather than either the value or the constraint. Adversarial RCPG also formulates the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian but learns this directly and incrementally as an adversarial policy through gradient descent rather than indirectly and abruptly through constrained optimisation on a sorted value list. A theoretical analysis first derives the Lagrangian policy gradient for the policy optimisation of both proposed algorithms and then the adversarial policy gradient to learn the adversary for Adversarial RCPG. Empirical experiments injecting perturbations in inventory management and safe navigation tasks demonstrate the competitive performance of both algorithms compared to traditional RCPG variants as well as non-robust and non-constrained ablations. In particular, Adversarial RCPG ranks among the top two performing algorithms on all tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haechan Mark Bong, Rongge Zhang, Ricardo de Azambuja, Giovanni Beltrame</p>
<p>Abstract: This work targets what we consider to be the foundational step for urban airborne robots, a safe landing. Our attention is directed toward what we deem the most crucial aspect of the safe landing perception stack: segmentation. We present a streamlined reactive UAV system that employs visual servoing by harnessing the capabilities of open vocabulary image segmentation. This approach can adapt to various scenarios with minimal adjustments, bypassing the necessity for extensive data accumulation for refining internal models, thanks to its open vocabulary methodology. Given the limitations imposed by local authorities, our primary focus centers on operations originating from altitudes of 100 meters. This choice is deliberate, as numerous preceding works have dealt with altitudes up to 30 meters, aligning with the capabilities of small stereo cameras. Consequently, we leave the remaining 20m to be navigated using conventional 3D path planning methods. Utilizing monocular cameras and image segmentation, our findings demonstrate the system's capability to successfully execute landing maneuvers at altitudes as low as 20 meters. However, this approach is vulnerable to intermittent and occasionally abrupt fluctuations in the segmentation between frames in a video stream. To address this challenge, we enhance the image segmentation output by introducing what we call a dynamic focus: a masking mechanism that self adjusts according to the current landing stage. This dynamic focus guides the control system to avoid regions beyond the drone's safety radius projected onto the ground, thus mitigating the problems with fluctuations. Through the implementation of this supplementary layer, our experiments have reached improvements in the landing success rate of almost tenfold when compared to global segmentation. All the source code is open source and available online (github.com/MISTLab/DOVESEI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunho Kim, Hyunsik Oh, Jeonghyun Lee, Jinhyeok Choi, Gwanghyeon Ji, Moonkyu Jung, Donghoon Youm, Jemin Hwangbo</p>
<p>Abstract: Several earlier studies have shown impressive control performance in complex robotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed through extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and time-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic systems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering process can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Arawjo, Chelse Swoopes, Priyan Vaithilingam, Martin Wattenberg, Elena Glassman</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating outputs of large language models (LLMs) is challenging, requiring making -- and making sense of -- many responses. Yet tools that go beyond basic prompting tend to require knowledge of programming APIs, focus on narrow domains, or are closed-source. We present ChainForge, an open-source visual toolkit for prompt engineering and on-demand hypothesis testing of text generation LLMs. ChainForge provides a graphical interface for comparison of responses across models and prompt variations. Our system was designed to support three tasks: model selection, prompt template design, and hypothesis testing (e.g., auditing). We released ChainForge early in its development and iterated on its design with academics and online users. Through in-lab and interview studies, we find that a range of people could use ChainForge to investigate hypotheses that matter to them, including in real-world settings. We identify three modes of prompt engineering and LLM hypothesis testing: opportunistic exploration, limited evaluation, and iterative refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuba Girgin, Emre Ugur</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning object affordances is an effective tool in the field of robot learning. While the data-driven models investigate affordances of single or paired objects, there is a gap in the exploration of affordances of compound objects composed of an arbitrary number of objects. We propose the Multi-Object Graph Affordance Network which models complex compound object affordances by learning the outcomes of robot actions that facilitate interactions between an object and a compound. Given the depth images of the objects, the object features are extracted via convolution operations and encoded in the nodes of graph neural networks. Graph convolution operations are used to encode the state of the compounds, which are used as input to decoders to predict the outcome of the object-compound interactions. After learning the compound object affordances, given different tasks, the learned outcome predictors are used to plan sequences of stack actions that involve stacking objects on top of each other, inserting smaller objects into larger containers and passing through ring-like objects through poles. We showed that our system successfully modeled the affordances of compound objects that include concave and convex objects, in both simulated and real-world environments. We benchmarked our system with a baseline model to highlight its advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Lin, Chen Zhao, Minglai Shao, Baoluo Meng, Xujiang Zhao, Haifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing the prevalence of domain shift as a common challenge in machine learning, various domain generalization (DG) techniques have been developed to enhance the performance of machine learning systems when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, data distributions can gradually change across a sequence of sequential domains. While current methodologies primarily focus on improving model effectiveness within these new domains, they often overlook fairness issues throughout the learning process. In response, we introduce an innovative framework called Counterfactual Fairness-Aware Domain Generalization with Sequential Autoencoder (CDSAE). This approach effectively separates environmental information and sensitive attributes from the embedded representation of classification features. This concurrent separation not only greatly improves model generalization across diverse and unfamiliar domains but also effectively addresses challenges related to unfair classification. Our strategy is rooted in the principles of causal inference to tackle these dual issues. To examine the intricate relationship between semantic information, sensitive attributes, and environmental cues, we systematically categorize exogenous uncertainty factors into four latent variables: 1) semantic information influenced by sensitive attributes, 2) semantic information unaffected by sensitive attributes, 3) environmental cues influenced by sensitive attributes, and 4) environmental cues unaffected by sensitive attributes. By incorporating fairness regularization, we exclusively employ semantic information for classification purposes. Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiates the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved accuracy levels while ensuring the preservation of fairness in the evolving landscape of continuous domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehui Huang, Zhaojing Yang, Rahul Krupani, Bask{\i}n \c{S}enba\c{s}lar, Sumeet Batra, Gaurav S. Sukhatme</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for quadrotor control promises many benefits -- easy deployment, task generalization and real-time execution capability. Prior end-to-end DRL-based methods have showcased the ability to deploy learned controllers onto single quadrotors or quadrotor teams maneuvering in simple, obstacle-free environments. However, the addition of obstacles increases the number of possible interactions exponentially, thereby increasing the difficulty of training RL policies. In this work, we propose an end-to-end DRL approach to control quadrotor swarms in environments with obstacles. We provide our agents a curriculum and a replay buffer of the clipped collision episodes to improve performance in obstacle-rich environments. We implement an attention mechanism to attend to the neighbor robots and obstacle interactions - the first successful demonstration of this mechanism on policies for swarm behavior deployed on severely compute-constrained hardware. Our work is the first work that demonstrates the possibility of learning neighbor-avoiding and obstacle-avoiding control policies trained with end-to-end DRL that transfers zero-shot to real quadrotors. Our approach scales to 32 robots with 80% obstacle density in simulation and 8 robots with 20% obstacle density in physical deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhao Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by Federated Learning, in this paper, we propose personal large models that are distilled from traditional large language models but more adaptive to local users' personal information such as education background and hobbies. We classify the large language models into three levels: the personal level, expert level and traditional level. The personal level models are adaptive to users' personal information. They encrypt the users' input and protect their privacy. The expert level models focus on merging specific knowledge such as finance, IT and art. The traditional models focus on the universal knowledge discovery and upgrading the expert models. In such classifications, the personal models directly interact with the user. For the whole system, the personal models have users' (encrypted) personal information. Moreover, such models must be small enough to be performed on personal computers or mobile devices. Finally, they also have to response in real-time for better user experience and produce high quality results. The proposed personal large models can be applied in a wide range of applications such as language and vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Lian, Baifeng Shi, Adam Yala, Trevor Darrell, Boyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have emerged as a promising tool for neural video generation. However, current models still struggle with intricate spatiotemporal prompts and often generate restricted or incorrect motion. To address these limitations, we introduce LLM-grounded Video Diffusion (LVD). Instead of directly generating videos from the text inputs, LVD first leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate dynamic scene layouts based on the text inputs and subsequently uses the generated layouts to guide a diffusion model for video generation. We show that LLMs are able to understand complex spatiotemporal dynamics from text alone and generate layouts that align closely with both the prompts and the object motion patterns typically observed in the real world. We then propose to guide video diffusion models with these layouts by adjusting the attention maps. Our approach is training-free and can be integrated into any video diffusion model that admits classifier guidance. Our results demonstrate that LVD significantly outperforms its base video diffusion model and several strong baseline methods in faithfully generating videos with the desired attributes and motion patterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have brought changes to the landscape of machine learning, demonstrating sparks of human-level intelligence across a diverse array of tasks. However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for complex tasks. We propose a novel, theoretically sound method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that our approach CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset causal inference methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Hamza Asad, Saeed Anwar, Abdul Bais</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern agriculture heavily relies on Site-Specific Farm Management practices, necessitating accurate detection, localization, and quantification of crops and weeds in the field, which can be achieved using deep learning techniques. In this regard, crop and weed-specific binary segmentation models have shown promise. However, uncontrolled field conditions limit their performance from one field to the other. To improve semantic model generalization, existing methods augment and synthesize agricultural data to account for uncontrolled field conditions. However, given highly varied field conditions, these methods have limitations. To overcome the challenges of model deterioration in such conditions, we propose utilizing data specific to other crops and weeds for our specific target problem. To achieve this, we propose a novel ensemble framework. Our approach involves utilizing different crop and weed models trained on diverse datasets and employing a teacher-student configuration. By using homogeneous stacking of base models and a trainable meta-architecture to combine their outputs, we achieve significant improvements for Canola crops and Kochia weeds on unseen test data, surpassing the performance of single semantic segmentation models. We identify the UNET meta-architecture as the most effective in this context. Finally, through ablation studies, we demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We observe that including base models trained on other target crops and weeds can help generalize the model to capture varied field conditions. Lastly, we propose two novel datasets with varied conditions for comparisons.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) improve performance by accessing long-tail and up-to-date knowledge from external data stores, but are challenging to build. Existing approaches require either expensive retrieval-specific modifications to LM pre-training or use post-hoc integration of the data store that leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning (RA-DIT), a lightweight fine-tuning methodology that provides a third option by retrofitting any LLM with retrieval capabilities. Our approach operates in two distinct fine-tuning steps: (1) one updates a pre-trained LM to better use retrieved information, while (2) the other updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM. By fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, we demonstrate that each stage yields significant performance improvements, and using both leads to additional gains. Our best model, RA-DIT 65B, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of knowledge-intensive zero- and few-shot learning benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing in-context RALM approaches by up to +8.9% in 0-shot setting and +1.4% in 5-shot setting on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ori Yoran, Tomer Wolfson, Ori Ram, Jonathan Berant</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) hold promise to produce language understanding systems that are are factual, efficient, and up-to-date. An important desideratum of RALMs, is that retrieved information helps model performance when it is relevant, and does not harm performance when it is not. This is particularly important in multi-hop reasoning scenarios, where misuse of irrelevant evidence can lead to cascading errors. However, recent work has shown that retrieval augmentation can sometimes have a negative effect on performance. In this work, we present a thorough analysis on five open-domain question answering benchmarks, characterizing cases when retrieval reduces accuracy. We then propose two methods to mitigate this issue. First, a simple baseline that filters out retrieved passages that do not entail question-answer pairs according to a natural language inference (NLI) model. This is effective in preventing performance reduction, but at a cost of also discarding relevant passages. Thus, we propose a method for automatically generating data to fine-tune the language model to properly leverage retrieved passages, using a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts at training time. We empirically show that even 1,000 examples suffice to train the model to be robust to irrelevant contexts while maintaining high performance on examples with relevant ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in various tasks, but concerns about their safety and the potential for generating harmful content have emerged. In this paper, we delve into the potential of In-Context Learning (ICL) to modulate the alignment of LLMs. Specifically, we propose the In-Context Attack (ICA), which employs strategically crafted harmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs, and the In-Context Defense (ICD), which bolsters model resilience through examples that demonstrate refusal to produce harmful responses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ICA and ICD in respectively elevating and mitigating the success rates of jailbreaking prompts. Moreover, we offer theoretical insights into the mechanism by which a limited set of in-context demonstrations can pivotally influence the safety alignment of LLMs. Our findings illuminate the profound influence of ICL on LLM behavior, opening new avenues for improving the safety and alignment of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Hung Nguyen, Sebastian Tschiatschek, Adish Singla</p>
<p>Abstract: Student modeling is central to many educational technologies as it enables predicting future learning outcomes and designing targeted instructional strategies. However, open-ended learning domains pose challenges for accurately modeling students due to the diverse behaviors and a large space of possible misconceptions. To approach these challenges, we explore the application of large language models (LLMs) for in-context student modeling in open-ended learning domains. More concretely, given a particular student's attempt on a reference task as observation, the objective is to synthesize the student's attempt on a target task. We introduce a novel framework, LLM for Student Synthesis (LLM-SS), that leverages LLMs for synthesizing a student's behavior. Our framework can be combined with different LLMs; moreover, we fine-tune LLMs to boost their student modeling capabilities. We instantiate several methods based on LLM-SS framework and evaluate them using an existing benchmark, StudentSyn, for student attempt synthesis in a visual programming domain. Experimental results show that our methods perform significantly better than the baseline method NeurSS provided in the StudentSyn benchmark. Furthermore, our method using a fine-tuned version of the GPT-3.5 model is significantly better than using the base GPT-3.5 model and gets close to human tutors' performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Pang, Ziyang Xie, Yunze Man, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper reveals that large language models (LLMs), despite being trained solely on textual data, are surprisingly strong encoders for purely visual tasks in the absence of language. Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved by a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -- employing a frozen transformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to directly process visual tokens. Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks, encompassing pure 2D and 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks. We additionally propose the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding -- the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern informative visual tokens and further amplify their effect. This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions. We hope that our work inspires new perspectives on utilizing LLMs and deepening our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengqi Gao, Fan-Keng Sun, Ron Rohrer, Duane S. Boning</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we leverage a foundational principle of analog electronic circuitry, Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, to introduce a distinctive class of neural network models termed KirchhoffNet. Essentially, KirchhoffNet is an analog circuit that can function as a neural network, utilizing its initial node voltages as the neural network input and the node voltages at a specific time point as the output. The evolution of node voltages within the specified time is dictated by learnable parameters on the edges connecting nodes. We demonstrate that KirchhoffNet is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and notably, even in the absence of traditional layers (such as convolution layers), it attains state-of-the-art performances across diverse and complex machine learning tasks. Most importantly, KirchhoffNet can be potentially implemented as a low-power analog integrated circuit, leading to an appealing property -- irrespective of the number of parameters within a KirchhoffNet, its on-chip forward calculation can always be completed within a short time. This characteristic makes KirchhoffNet a promising and fundamental paradigm for implementing large-scale neural networks, opening a new avenue in analog neural networks for AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahai Feng, Jacob Steinhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: To correctly use in-context information, language models (LMs) must bind entities to their attributes. For example, given a context describing a "green square" and a "blue circle", LMs must bind the shapes to their respective colors. We analyze LM representations and identify the binding ID mechanism: a general mechanism for solving the binding problem, which we observe in every sufficiently large model from the Pythia and LLaMA families. Using causal interventions, we show that LMs' internal activations represent binding information by attaching binding ID vectors to corresponding entities and attributes. We further show that binding ID vectors form a continuous subspace, in which distances between binding ID vectors reflect their discernability. Overall, our results uncover interpretable strategies in LMs for representing symbolic knowledge in-context, providing a step towards understanding general in-context reasoning in large-scale LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Owen Henkel, Libby Hills, Bill Roberts, Joshua McGrane</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended questions, which require students to produce multi-word, nontrivial responses, are a popular tool for formative assessment as they provide more specific insights into what students do and don't know. However, grading open-ended questions can be time-consuming leading teachers to resort to simpler question formats or conduct fewer formative assessments. While there has been a longstanding interest in automating of short-answer grading (ASAG), but previous approaches have been technically complex, limiting their use in formative assessment contexts. The newest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially makes grading short answer questions more feasible. This paper investigates the potential for the newest version of LLMs to be used in ASAG, specifically in the grading of short answer questions for formative assessments, in two ways. First, it introduces a novel dataset of short answer reading comprehension questions, drawn from a set of reading assessments conducted with over 150 students in Ghana. This dataset allows for the evaluation of LLMs in a new context, as they are predominantly designed and trained on data from high-income North American countries. Second, the paper empirically evaluates how well various configurations of generative LLMs grade student short answer responses compared to expert human raters. The findings show that GPT-4, with minimal prompt engineering, performed extremely well on grading the novel dataset (QWK 0.92, F1 0.89), reaching near parity with expert human raters. To our knowledge this work is the first to empirically evaluate the performance of generative LLMs on short answer reading comprehension questions using real student data, with low technical hurdles to attaining this performance. These findings suggest that generative LLMs could be used to grade formative literacy assessment tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creoles represent an under-explored and marginalized group of languages, with few available resources for NLP research.While the genealogical ties between Creoles and a number of highly-resourced languages imply a significant potential for transfer learning, this potential is hampered due to this lack of annotated data. In this work we present CreoleVal, a collection of benchmark datasets spanning 8 different NLP tasks, covering up to 28 Creole languages; it is an aggregate of novel development datasets for reading comprehension, relation classification, and machine translation for Creoles, in addition to a practical gateway to a handful of preexisting benchmarks. For each benchmark, we conduct baseline experiments in a zero-shot setting in order to further ascertain the capabilities and limitations of transfer learning for Creoles. Ultimately, we see CreoleVal as an opportunity to empower research on Creoles in NLP and computational linguistics, and in general, a step towards more equitable language technology around the globe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyuan Hu, Suvir Mirchandani, Dorsa Sadigh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the considerable potential of reinforcement learning (RL), robotic control tasks predominantly rely on imitation learning (IL) due to its better sample efficiency. However, it is costly to collect comprehensive expert demonstrations that enable IL to generalize to all possible scenarios, and any distribution shift would require recollecting data for finetuning. Therefore, RL is appealing if it can build upon IL as an efficient autonomous self-improvement procedure. We propose imitation bootstrapped reinforcement learning (IBRL), a novel framework for sample-efficient RL with demonstrations that first trains an IL policy on the provided demonstrations and then uses it to propose alternative actions for both online exploration and bootstrapping target values. Compared to prior works that oversample the demonstrations or regularize RL with an additional imitation loss, IBRL is able to utilize high quality actions from IL policies since the beginning of training, which greatly accelerates exploration and training efficiency. We evaluate IBRL on 6 simulation and 3 real-world tasks spanning various difficulty levels. IBRL significantly outperforms prior methods and the improvement is particularly more prominent in harder tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishvak Murahari, Ameet Deshpande, Peter Clark, Tanmay Rajpurohit, Ashish Sabharwal, Karthik Narasimhan, Ashwin Kalyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative evaluation metrics have traditionally been pivotal in gauging the advancements of artificial intelligence systems, including large language models (LLMs). However, these metrics have inherent limitations. Given the intricate nature of real-world tasks, a single scalar to quantify and compare is insufficient to capture the fine-grained nuances of model behavior. Metrics serve only as a way to compare and benchmark models, and do not yield actionable diagnostics, thus making the model improvement process challenging. Model developers find themselves amid extensive manual efforts involving sifting through vast datasets and attempting hit-or-miss adjustments to training data or setups. In this work, we address the shortcomings of quantitative metrics by proposing QualEval, which augments quantitative scalar metrics with automated qualitative evaluation as a vehicle for model improvement. QualEval uses a powerful LLM reasoner and our novel flexible linear programming solver to generate human-readable insights that when applied, accelerate model improvement. The insights are backed by a comprehensive dashboard with fine-grained visualizations and human-interpretable analyses. We corroborate the faithfulness of QualEval by demonstrating that leveraging its insights, for example, improves the absolute performance of the Llama 2 model by up to 15% points relative on a challenging dialogue task (DialogSum) when compared to baselines. QualEval successfully increases the pace of model development, thus in essence serving as a data-scientist-in-a-box. Given the focus on critiquing and improving current evaluation metrics, our method serves as a refreshingly new technique for both model evaluation and improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjie Wang, Joel Jennings, Wenbo Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering the underlying relationships among variables from temporal observations has been a longstanding challenge in numerous scientific disciplines, including biology, finance, and climate science. The dynamics of such systems are often best described using continuous-time stochastic processes. Unfortunately, most existing structure learning approaches assume that the underlying process evolves in discrete-time and/or observations occur at regular time intervals. These mismatched assumptions can often lead to incorrect learned structures and models. In this work, we introduce a novel structure learning method, SCOTCH, which combines neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) with variational inference to infer a posterior distribution over possible structures. This continuous-time approach can naturally handle both learning from and predicting observations at arbitrary time points. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions for an SDE and SCOTCH to be structurally identifiable, and prove its consistency under infinite data limits. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved structure learning performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to relevant baselines under regular and irregular sampling intervals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational moderation of online communities is crucial to maintaining civility for a constructive environment, but it is challenging to scale and harmful to moderators. The inclusion of sophisticated natural language generation modules as a force multiplier to aid human moderators is a tantalizing prospect, but adequate evaluation approaches have so far been elusive. In this paper, we establish a systematic definition of conversational moderation effectiveness grounded on moderation literature and establish design criteria for conducting realistic yet safe evaluation. We then propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess models' moderation capabilities independently of human intervention. With our framework, we conduct the first known study of language models as conversational moderators, finding that appropriately prompted models that incorporate insights from social science can provide specific and fair feedback on toxic behavior but struggle to influence users to increase their levels of respect and cooperation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Kolpakov, Igor Rivin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this note we use the State of the Union Address (SOTU) dataset from Kaggle to make some surprising (and some not so surprising) observations pertaining to the general timeline of American history, and the character and nature of the addresses themselves. Our main approach is using vector embeddings, such as BERT (DistilBERT) and GPT-2.
  While it is widely believed that BERT (and its variations) is most suitable for NLP classification tasks, we find out that GPT-2 in conjunction with nonlinear dimension reduction methods such as UMAP provide better separation and stronger clustering. This makes GPT-2 + UMAP an interesting alternative. In our case, no model fine-tuning is required, and the pre-trained out-of-the-box GPT-2 model is enough.
  We also used a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for classification detecting which President delivered which address, with very good results (accuracy 93% - 95% depending on the run). An analogous task was performed to determine the year of writing, and we were able to pin it down to about 4 years (which is a single presidential term).
  It is worth noting that SOTU addresses provide relatively small writing samples (with about 8'000 words on average, and varying widely from under 2'000 words to more than 20'000), and that the number of authors is relatively large (we used SOTU addresses of 42 US presidents). This shows that the techniques employed turn out to be rather efficient, while all the computations described in this note can be performed using a single GPU instance of Google Colab.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonsu Lyu, Jonggyu Jang, Sehyun Ryu, Hyun Jong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence functions (IFs) elucidate how training data changes model behavior. However, the increasing size and non-convexity in large-scale models make IFs inaccurate. We suspect that the fragility comes from the first-order approximation which may cause nuisance changes in parameters irrelevant to the examined data. However, simply computing influence from the chosen parameters can be misleading, as it fails to nullify the hidden effects of unselected parameters on the analyzed data. Thus, our approach introduces generalized IFs, precisely estimating target parameters' influence while nullifying nuisance gradient changes on fixed parameters. We identify target update parameters closely associated with the input data by the output- and gradient-based parameter selection methods. We verify the generalized IFs with various alternatives of IFs on the class removal and label change tasks. The experiments align with the "less is more" philosophy, demonstrating that updating only 5\% of the model produces more accurate results than other influence functions across all tasks. We believe our proposal works as a foundational tool for optimizing models, conducting data analysis, and enhancing AI interpretability beyond the limitation of IFs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cedric Derstroff, Mattia Cerrato, Jannis Brugger, Jan Peters, Stefan Kramer</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer learning is a novel high-level reinforcement learning framework for agents learning in groups. While standard reinforcement learning trains an individual agent in trial-and-error fashion, all on its own, peer learning addresses a related setting in which a group of agents, i.e., peers, learns to master a task simultaneously together from scratch. Peers are allowed to communicate only about their own states and actions recommended by others: "What would you do in my situation?". Our motivation is to study the learning behavior of these agents. We formalize the teacher selection process in the action advice setting as a multi-armed bandit problem and therefore highlight the need for exploration. Eventually, we analyze the learning behavior of the peers and observe their ability to rank the agents' performance within the study group and understand which agents give reliable advice. Further, we compare peer learning with single agent learning and a state-of-the-art action advice baseline. We show that peer learning is able to outperform single-agent learning and the baseline in several challenging discrete and continuous OpenAI Gym domains. Doing so, we also show that within such a framework complex policies from action recommendations beyond discrete action spaces can evolve.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10561">Enabling Accelerators for Graph Computing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh Shivdikar</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has revolutionized the field of machine learning, offering a novel paradigm for learning on graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks, GNNs are capable of capturing complex relationships and dependencies inherent in graph data, making them particularly suited for a wide range of applications including social network analysis, molecular chemistry, and network security. GNNs, with their unique structure and operation, present new computational challenges compared to conventional neural networks. This requires comprehensive benchmarking and a thorough characterization of GNNs to obtain insight into their computational requirements and to identify potential performance bottlenecks. In this thesis, we aim to develop a better understanding of how GNNs interact with the underlying hardware and will leverage this knowledge as we design specialized accelerators and develop new optimizations, leading to more efficient and faster GNN computations. A pivotal component within GNNs is the Sparse General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) kernel, known for its computational intensity and irregular memory access patterns. In this thesis, we address the challenges posed by SpGEMM by implementing a highly optimized hashing-based SpGEMM kernel tailored for a custom accelerator. Synthesizing these insights and optimizations, we design state-of-the-art hardware accelerators capable of efficiently handling various GNN workloads. Our accelerator architectures are built on our characterization of GNN computational demands, providing clear motivation for our approaches. This exploration into novel models underlines our comprehensive approach, as we strive to enable accelerators that are not just performant, but also versatile, able to adapt to the evolving landscape of graph computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yacine Izza, Kuldeep S. Meel, Joao Marques-Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is widely regarding as a cornerstone of trustworthy AI. Unfortunately, most work on XAI offers no guarantees of rigor. In high-stakes domains, e.g. uses of AI that impact humans, the lack of rigor of explanations can have disastrous consequences. Formal abductive explanations offer crucial guarantees of rigor and so are of interest in high-stakes uses of machine learning (ML). One drawback of abductive explanations is explanation size, justified by the cognitive limits of human decision-makers. Probabilistic abductive explanations (PAXps) address this limitation, but their theoretical and practical complexity makes their exact computation most often unrealistic. This paper proposes novel efficient algorithms for the computation of locally-minimal PXAps, which offer high-quality approximations of PXAps in practice. The experimental results demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingxing Zuo, Pouya Samangouei, Yunwen Zhou, Yan Di, Mingyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Precisely perceiving the geometric and semantic properties of real-world 3D objects is crucial for the continued evolution of augmented reality and robotic applications. To this end, we present Foundation Model Embedded Gaussian Splatting (FMGS), which incorporates vision-language embeddings of foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS). The key contribution of this work is an efficient method to reconstruct and represent 3D vision-language models. This is achieved by distilling feature maps generated from image-based foundation models into those rendered from our 3D model. To ensure high-quality rendering and fast training, we introduce a novel scene representation by integrating strengths from both GS and multi-resolution hash encodings (MHE). Our effective training procedure also introduces a pixel alignment loss that makes the rendered feature distance of the same semantic entities close, following the pixel-level semantic boundaries. Our results demonstrate remarkable multi-view semantic consistency, facilitating diverse downstream tasks, beating state-of-the-art methods by 10.2 percent on open-vocabulary language-based object detection, despite that we are 851X faster for inference. This research explores the intersection of vision, language, and 3D scene representation, paving the way for enhanced scene understanding in uncontrolled real-world environments. We plan to release the code on the project page.</p>

<p>Abstract: Indoor scene generation has attracted significant attention recently as it is crucial for applications of gaming, virtual reality, and interior design. Current indoor scene generation methods can produce reasonable room layouts but often lack diversity and realism. This is primarily due to the limited coverage of existing datasets, including only large furniture without tiny furnishings in daily life. To address these challenges, we propose FurniScene, a large-scale 3D room dataset with intricate furnishing scenes from interior design professionals. Specifically, the FurniScene consists of 11,698 rooms and 39,691 unique furniture CAD models with 89 different types, covering things from large beds to small teacups on the coffee table. To better suit fine-grained indoor scene layout generation, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Diffusion Scene Model (TSDSM) and conduct an evaluation benchmark for various indoor scene generation based on FurniScene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the capability of our method to generate highly realistic indoor scenes. Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.</p>

We analyze the phase diagram of this model in different limits of common hyperparameters including width, layer-wise learning rates, scale of output, and scale of initialization. Our solution identifies three novel prototype mechanisms of feature learning: (1) learning by alignment, (2) learning by disalignment, and (3) learning by rescaling. In sharp contrast, none of these mechanisms is present in the kernel regime of the model. We empirically demonstrate that these discoveries also appear in deep nonlinear networks in real tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robot learning tasks are extremely compute-intensive and hardware-specific. Thus the avenues of tackling these challenges, using a diverse dataset of offline demonstrations that can be used to train robot manipulation agents, is very appealing. The Train-Offline-Test-Online (TOTO) Benchmark provides a well-curated open-source dataset for offline training comprised mostly of expert data and also benchmark scores of the common offline-RL and behaviour cloning agents. In this paper, we introduce DiffClone, an offline algorithm of enhanced behaviour cloning agent with diffusion-based policy learning, and measured the efficacy of our method on real online physical robots at test time. This is also our official submission to the Train-Offline-Test-Online (TOTO) Benchmark Challenge organized at NeurIPS 2023. We experimented with both pre-trained visual representation and agent policies. In our experiments, we find that MOCO finetuned ResNet50 performs the best in comparison to other finetuned representations. Goal state conditioning and mapping to transitions resulted in a minute increase in the success rate and mean-reward. As for the agent policy, we developed DiffClone, a behaviour cloning agent improved using conditional diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nachuan Ma, Rui Fan, Lihua Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, automated methods have been developed to detect cracks more efficiently, accurately, and objectively, with the ultimate goal of replacing conventional manual visual inspection techniques. Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalizability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits satisfactory performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms. Our source code is publicly available at mias.group/UP-CrackNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Transformers for graph representation learning have become increasingly popular, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide-variety of graph datasets, either alone or in combination with message-passing graph neural networks (MP-GNNs). Infusing graph inductive-biases in the innately structure-agnostic transformer architecture in the form of structural or positional encodings (PEs) is key to achieving these impressive results. However, designing such encodings is tricky and disparate attempts have been made to engineer such encodings including Laplacian eigenvectors, relative random-walk probabilities (RRWP), spatial encodings, centrality encodings, edge encodings etc. In this work, we argue that such encodings may not be required at all, provided the attention mechanism itself incorporates information about the graph structure. We introduce Eigenformer, a Graph Transformer employing a novel spectrum-aware attention mechanism cognizant of the Laplacian spectrum of the graph, and empirically show that it achieves performance competetive with SOTA Graph Transformers on a number of standard GNN benchmarks. Additionally, we theoretically prove that Eigenformer can express various graph structural connectivity matrices, which is particularly essential when learning over smaller graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minglai Shao, Dong Li, Chen Zhao, Xintao Wu, Yujie Lin, Qin Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised fairness-aware machine learning under distribution shifts is an emerging field that addresses the challenge of maintaining equitable and unbiased predictions when faced with changes in data distributions from source to target domains. In real-world applications, machine learning models are often trained on a specific dataset but deployed in environments where the data distribution may shift over time due to various factors. This shift can lead to unfair predictions, disproportionately affecting certain groups characterized by sensitive attributes, such as race and gender. In this survey, we provide a summary of various types of distribution shifts and comprehensively investigate existing methods based on these shifts, highlighting six commonly used approaches in the literature. Additionally, this survey lists publicly available datasets and evaluation metrics for empirical studies. We further explore the interconnection with related research fields, discuss the significant challenges, and identify potential directions for future studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) have emerged as a pivotal tool in advancing healthcare applications and machine learning models, particularly for researchers without direct access to healthcare data. Although existing methods, like rule-based approaches and generative adversarial networks (GANs), generate synthetic data that resembles real-world EHR data, these methods often use a tabular format, disregarding temporal dependencies in patient histories and limiting data replication. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for EHR data. This enables applications like disease progression analysis, population estimation, counterfactual reasoning, and synthetic data generation. In this work, we focus on synthetic data generation and demonstrate the capability of training a GPT model using a particular patient representation derived from CEHR-BERT, enabling us to generate patient sequences that can be seamlessly converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data format.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehong Wang, Zheyuan Zhang, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning aims to enhance performance on a target task by using knowledge from related tasks. However, when the source and target tasks are not closely aligned, it can lead to reduced performance, known as negative transfer. Unlike in image or text data, we find that negative transfer could commonly occur in graph-structured data, even when source and target graphs have semantic similarities. Specifically, we identify that structural differences significantly amplify the dissimilarities in the node embeddings across graphs. To mitigate this, we bring a new insight in this paper: for semantically similar graphs, although structural differences lead to significant distribution shift in node embeddings, their impact on subgraph embeddings could be marginal. Building on this insight, we introduce Subgraph Pooling (SP) by aggregating nodes sampled from a k-hop neighborhood and Subgraph Pooling++ (SP++) by a random walk, to mitigate the impact of graph structural differences on knowledge transfer. We theoretically analyze the role of SP in reducing graph discrepancy and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its superiority under various settings. The proposed SP methods are effective yet elegant, which can be easily applied on top of any backbone Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaorui Zuo, Yao-Tsung Chen, Wolfgang Karl H\"ardle</p>
<p>Abstract: In the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrency, social media platforms like Twitter have become pivotal in influencing market trends and investor sentiments. In our study, we leverage GPT-4 and a fine-tuned transformer-based BERT model for a multimodal sentiment analysis, focusing on the impact of emoji sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. By translating emojis into quantifiable sentiment data, we correlate these insights with key market indicators like BTC Price and the VCRIX index. Our architecture's analysis of emoji sentiment demonstrated a distinct advantage over FinBERT's pure text sentiment analysis in such predicting power. This approach may be fed into the development of trading strategies aimed at utilizing social media elements to identify and forecast market trends. Crucially, our findings suggest that strategies based on emoji sentiment can facilitate the avoidance of significant market downturns and contribute to the stabilization of returns. This research underscores the practical benefits of integrating advanced AI-driven analyses into financial strategies, offering a nuanced perspective on the interplay between digital communication and market dynamics in an academic context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangchao Deng, Bingqing Qu, Pengyang Wang, Dingqi Yang, Benjamin Fankhauser, Philippe Cudre-Mauroux</p>
<p>Abstract: Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Schoenegger, Indre Tuminauskaite, Peter S. Park, Philip E. Tetlock</p>
<p>Abstract: Human forecasting accuracy in practice relies on the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect, in which predictions about future events are significantly improved by aggregating across a crowd of individual forecasters. Past work on the forecasting ability of large language models (LLMs) suggests that frontier LLMs, as individual forecasters, underperform compared to the gold standard of a human crowd forecasting tournament aggregate. In Study 1, we expand this research by using an LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs. We compare the aggregated LLM predictions on 31 binary questions to that of a crowd of 925 human forecasters from a three-month forecasting tournament. Our preregistered main analysis shows that the LLM crowd outperforms a simple no-information benchmark and is not statistically different from the human crowd. In exploratory analyses, we find that these two approaches are equivalent with respect to medium-effect-size equivalence bounds. We also observe an acquiescence effect, with mean model predictions being significantly above 50%, despite an almost even split of positive and negative resolutions. Moreover, in Study 2, we test whether LLM predictions (of GPT-4 and Claude 2) can be improved by drawing on human cognitive output. We find that both models' forecasting accuracy benefits from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by between 17% and 28%: though this leads to less accurate predictions than simply averaging human and machine forecasts. Our results suggest that LLMs can achieve forecasting accuracy rivaling that of human crowd forecasting tournaments: via the simple, practically applicable method of forecast aggregation. This replicates the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect for LLMs, and opens up their use for a variety of applications throughout society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niccol\`o Cavagnero, Gabriele Rosi, Claudia Cuttano, Francesca Pistilli, Marco Ciccone, Giuseppe Averta, Fabio Cermelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent transformer-based architectures have shown impressive results in the field of image segmentation. Thanks to their flexibility, they obtain outstanding performance in multiple segmentation tasks, such as semantic and panoptic, under a single unified framework. To achieve such impressive performance, these architectures employ intensive operations and require substantial computational resources, which are often not available, especially on edge devices. To fill this gap, we propose Prototype-based Efficient MaskFormer (PEM), an efficient transformer-based architecture that can operate in multiple segmentation tasks. PEM proposes a novel prototype-based cross-attention which leverages the redundancy of visual features to restrict the computation and improve the efficiency without harming the performance. In addition, PEM introduces an efficient multi-scale feature pyramid network, capable of extracting features that have high semantic content in an efficient way, thanks to the combination of deformable convolutions and context-based self-modulation. We benchmark the proposed PEM architecture on two tasks, semantic and panoptic segmentation, evaluated on two different datasets, Cityscapes and ADE20K. PEM demonstrates outstanding performance on every task and dataset, outperforming task-specific architectures while being comparable and even better than computationally-expensive baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiyu Zhang (Music), Honglong Cai (Music),  Yuezhang (Music),  Li, Yuexin Wu, Le Hou, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed</p>
<p>Abstract: Text Style Transfer (TST) seeks to alter the style of text while retaining its core content. Given the constraints of limited parallel datasets for TST, we propose CoTeX, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) alongside chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to facilitate TST. CoTeX distills the complex rewriting and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into more streamlined models capable of working with both non-parallel and parallel data. Through experimentation across four TST datasets, CoTeX is shown to surpass traditional supervised fine-tuning and knowledge distillation methods, particularly in low-resource settings. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation, comparing CoTeX against current unsupervised, supervised, in-context learning (ICL) techniques, and instruction-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, CoTeX distinguishes itself by offering transparent explanations for its style transfer process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Mao, Weilan Wang, Hongchao Du, Nan Guan, Chun Jason Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge or mobile devices offers significant benefits, such as enhanced data privacy and real-time processing capabilities. However, it also faces critical challenges due to the substantial memory requirement of LLMs. Quantization is an effective way of reducing the model size while maintaining good performance. However, even after quantization, LLMs may still be too big to fit entirely into the limited memory of edge or mobile devices and have to be partially loaded from the storage to complete the inference. In this case, the I/O latency of model loading becomes the bottleneck of the LLM inference latency. In this work, we take a preliminary step of studying applying data compression techniques to reduce data movement and thus speed up the inference of quantized LLM on memory-constrained devices. In particular, we discussed the compressibility of quantized LLMs, the trade-off between the compressibility and performance of quantized LLMs, and opportunities to optimize both of them jointly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingke Shen, Surabhi S Nath, Aenne Brielmann, Peter Dayan</p>
<p>Abstract: The complexity of visual stimuli plays an important role in many cognitive phenomena, including attention, engagement, memorability, time perception and aesthetic evaluation. Despite its importance, complexity is poorly understood and ironically, previous models of image complexity have been quite complex. There have been many attempts to find handcrafted features that explain complexity, but these features are usually dataset specific, and hence fail to generalise. On the other hand, more recent work has employed deep neural networks to predict complexity, but these models remain difficult to interpret, and do not guide a theoretical understanding of the problem. Here we propose to model complexity using segment-based representations of images. We use state-of-the-art segmentation models, SAM and FC-CLIP, to quantify the number of segments at multiple granularities, and the number of classes in an image respectively. We find that complexity is well-explained by a simple linear model with these two features across six diverse image-sets of naturalistic scene and art images. This suggests that the complexity of images can be surprisingly simple.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Jiang, Xinyu Yan, Ge-Peng Ji, Keren Fu, Meijun Sun, Huan Xiong, Deng-Ping Fan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) represents a noteworthy advancement towards the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. However, the model efficacy across both specialized and general tasks warrants further investigation. This paper endeavors to evaluate the competency of popular LVLMs in specialized and general tasks, respectively, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of these novel models. To gauge their efficacy in specialized tasks, we employ six challenging tasks across three distinct application scenarios, namely natural, healthcare, and industrial ones. Such six tasks include salient/camouflaged/transparent object detection, as well as polyp detection, skin lesion detection, and industrial anomaly detection. We examine the performance of three recent open-source LVLMs, including MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA-1.5, and Shikra, on both visual recognition and localization under these tasks. Moreover, we conduct empirical investigations utilizing the aforementioned LVLMs together with GPT-4V, assessing their multi-modal understanding capabilities in general tasks including object counting, absurd question answering, affordance reasoning, attribute recognition, and spatial relation reasoning. Our investigations reveal that these LVLMs demonstrate limited proficiency not only in specialized tasks but also in general tasks. We delve deep into this inadequacy and uncover several potential factors, including limited cognition in specialized tasks, object hallucination, text-to-image interference, and decreased robustness in complex problems. We hope this study could provide useful insights for the future development of LVLMs, helping researchers improve LVLMs to cope with both general and specialized applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Che Liu, Zhongwei Wan, Cheng Ouyang, Anand Shah, Wenjia Bai, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distillation is the task of replacing a complicated machine learning model with a simpler model that approximates the original [BCNM06,HVD15]. Despite many practical applications, basic questions about the extent to which models can be distilled, and the runtime and amount of data needed to distill, remain largely open.
  To study these questions, we initiate a general theory of distillation, defining PAC-distillation in an analogous way to PAC-learning [Val84]. As applications of this theory: (1) we propose new algorithms to extract the knowledge stored in the trained weights of neural networks -- we show how to efficiently distill neural networks into succinct, explicit decision tree representations when possible by using the ``linear representation hypothesis''; and (2) we prove that distillation can be much cheaper than learning from scratch, and make progress on characterizing its complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailai Yang, Zhiwei Liu, Qianqian Xie, Jimin Huang, Tianlin Zhang, Sophia Ananiadou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) aim to tackle heterogeneous human expectations and values via multi-objective preference alignment. However, existing methods are parameter-adherent to the policy model, leading to two key limitations: (1) the high-cost repetition of their alignment algorithms for each new target model; (2) they cannot expand to unseen objectives due to their static alignment objectives. In this work, we propose Meta-Objective Aligner (MetaAligner), a model that performs conditional weak-to-strong correction for weak responses to approach strong responses. MetaAligner is the first policy-agnostic and generalizable method for multi-objective preference alignment, which enables plug-and-play alignment by decoupling parameter updates from the policy models and facilitates zero-shot preference alignment for unseen objectives via in-context learning. Experimental results show that MetaAligner achieves significant and balanced improvements in multi-objective alignments on 10 state-of-the-art policy models, and outperforms previous alignment methods with down to 15.71x less GPU training hours. The model also effectively aligns unseen objectives, marking the first step towards generalizable multi-objective preference alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burcu Sayin, Pasquale Minervini, Jacopo Staiano, Andrea Passerini</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist and potentially correct physicians in medical decision-making tasks. We evaluate several LLMs, including Meditron, Llama2, and Mistral, to analyze the ability of these models to interact effectively with physicians across different scenarios. We consider questions from PubMedQA and several tasks, ranging from binary (yes/no) responses to long answer generation, where the answer of the model is produced after an interaction with a physician. Our findings suggest that prompt design significantly influences the downstream accuracy of LLMs and that LLMs can provide valuable feedback to physicians, challenging incorrect diagnoses and contributing to more accurate decision-making. For example, when the physician is accurate 38% of the time, Mistral can produce the correct answer, improving accuracy up to 74% depending on the prompt being used, while Llama2 and Meditron models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt choice. Our analysis also uncovers the challenges of ensuring that LLM-generated suggestions are pertinent and useful, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houssem Ben Braiek, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: This chapter explores the foundational concept of robustness in Machine Learning (ML) and its integral role in establishing trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The discussion begins with a detailed definition of robustness, portraying it as the ability of ML models to maintain stable performance across varied and unexpected environmental conditions. ML robustness is dissected through several lenses: its complementarity with generalizability; its status as a requirement for trustworthy AI; its adversarial vs non-adversarial aspects; its quantitative metrics; and its indicators such as reproducibility and explainability. The chapter delves into the factors that impede robustness, such as data bias, model complexity, and the pitfalls of underspecified ML pipelines. It surveys key techniques for robustness assessment from a broad perspective, including adversarial attacks, encompassing both digital and physical realms. It covers non-adversarial data shifts and nuances of Deep Learning (DL) software testing methodologies. The discussion progresses to explore amelioration strategies for bolstering robustness, starting with data-centric approaches like debiasing and augmentation. Further examination includes a variety of model-centric methods such as transfer learning, adversarial training, and randomized smoothing. Lastly, post-training methods are discussed, including ensemble techniques, pruning, and model repairs, emerging as cost-effective strategies to make models more resilient against the unpredictable. This chapter underscores the ongoing challenges and limitations in estimating and achieving ML robustness by existing approaches. It offers insights and directions for future research on this crucial concept, as a prerequisite for trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The conversational recommendation system (CRS) has been criticized regarding its user experience in real-world scenarios, despite recent significant progress achieved in academia. Existing evaluation protocols for CRS may prioritize system-centric factors such as effectiveness and fluency in conversation while neglecting user-centric aspects. Thus, we propose a new and inclusive evaluation protocol, Concept, which integrates both system- and user-centric factors. We conceptualise three key characteristics in representing such factors and further divide them into six primary abilities. To implement Concept, we adopt a LLM-based user simulator and evaluator with scoring rubrics that are tailored for each primary ability. Our protocol, Concept, serves a dual purpose. First, it provides an overview of the pros and cons in current CRS models. Second, it pinpoints the problem of low usability in the "omnipotent" ChatGPT and offers a comprehensive reference guide for evaluating CRS, thereby setting the foundation for CRS improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Gu, Yilin Wang, Nanxuan Zhao, Wei Xiong, Qing Liu, Zhifei Zhang, He Zhang, Jianming Zhang, HyunJoon Jung, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective editing of personal content holds a pivotal role in enabling individuals to express their creativity, weaving captivating narratives within their visual stories, and elevate the overall quality and impact of their visual content. Therefore, in this work, we introduce SwapAnything, a novel framework that can swap any objects in an image with personalized concepts given by the reference, while keeping the context unchanged. Compared with existing methods for personalized subject swapping, SwapAnything has three unique advantages: (1) precise control of arbitrary objects and parts rather than the main subject, (2) more faithful preservation of context pixels, (3) better adaptation of the personalized concept to the image. First, we propose targeted variable swapping to apply region control over latent feature maps and swap masked variables for faithful context preservation and initial semantic concept swapping. Then, we introduce appearance adaptation, to seamlessly adapt the semantic concept into the original image in terms of target location, shape, style, and content during the image generation process. Extensive results on both human and automatic evaluation demonstrate significant improvements of our approach over baseline methods on personalized swapping. Furthermore, SwapAnything shows its precise and faithful swapping abilities across single object, multiple objects, partial object, and cross-domain swapping tasks. SwapAnything also achieves great performance on text-based swapping and tasks beyond swapping such as object insertion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuan-Chieh Wang, Daniil Ostashev, Yuwei Fang, Sergey Tulyakov, Kfir Aberman</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new architecture for personalization of text-to-image diffusion models, coined Mixture-of-Attention (MoA). Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism utilized in large language models (LLMs), MoA distributes the generation workload between two attention pathways: a personalized branch and a non-personalized prior branch. MoA is designed to retain the original model's prior by fixing its attention layers in the prior branch, while minimally intervening in the generation process with the personalized branch that learns to embed subjects in the layout and context generated by the prior branch. A novel routing mechanism manages the distribution of pixels in each layer across these branches to optimize the blend of personalized and generic content creation. Once trained, MoA facilitates the creation of high-quality, personalized images featuring multiple subjects with compositions and interactions as diverse as those generated by the original model. Crucially, MoA enhances the distinction between the model's pre-existing capability and the newly augmented personalized intervention, thereby offering a more disentangled subject-context control that was previously unattainable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Fu, Yushi Hu, Bangzheng Li, Yu Feng, Haoyu Wang, Xudong Lin, Dan Roth, Noah A. Smith, Wei-Chiu Ma, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Blink, a new benchmark for multimodal language models (LLMs) that focuses on core visual perception abilities not found in other evaluations. Most of the Blink tasks can be solved by humans "within a blink" (e.g., relative depth estimation, visual correspondence, forensics detection, and multi-view reasoning). However, we find these perception-demanding tasks cast significant challenges for current multimodal LLMs because they resist mediation through natural language. Blink reformats 14 classic computer vision tasks into 3,807 multiple-choice questions, paired with single or multiple images and visual prompting. While humans get 95.70% accuracy on average, Blink is surprisingly challenging for existing multimodal LLMs: even the best-performing GPT-4V and Gemini achieve accuracies of 51.26% and 45.72%, only 13.17% and 7.63% higher than random guessing, indicating that such perception abilities have not "emerged" yet in recent multimodal LLMs. Our analysis also highlights that specialist CV models could solve these problems much better, suggesting potential pathways for future improvements. We believe Blink will stimulate the community to help multimodal LLMs catch up with human-level visual perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Shao, Zikai Zhou, Huanran Chen, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset condensation, a concept within data-centric learning, efficiently transfers critical attributes from an original dataset to a synthetic version, maintaining both diversity and realism. This approach significantly improves model training efficiency and is adaptable across multiple application areas. Previous methods in dataset condensation have faced challenges: some incur high computational costs which limit scalability to larger datasets (e.g., MTT, DREAM, and TESLA), while others are restricted to less optimal design spaces, which could hinder potential improvements, especially in smaller datasets (e.g., SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED). To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive design framework that includes specific, effective strategies like implementing soft category-aware matching and adjusting the learning rate schedule. These strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical backing. Our resulting approach, Elucidate Dataset Condensation (EDC), establishes a benchmark for both small and large-scale dataset condensation. In our testing, EDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reaching 48.6% on ImageNet-1k with a ResNet-18 model at an IPC of 10, which corresponds to a compression ratio of 0.78%. This performance exceeds those of SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED by margins of 27.3%, 17.2%, and 6.6%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Hong Cheng, Changshun Wu, Harald Ruess, Xingyu Zhao, Saddek Bensalem</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcing or even exacerbating societal biases and inequalities will increase significantly as generative AI increasingly produces useful artifacts, from text to images and beyond, for the real world. We address these issues by formally characterizing the notion of fairness for generative AI as a basis for monitoring and enforcing fairness. We define two levels of fairness using the notion of infinite sequences of abstractions of AI-generated artifacts such as text or images. The first is the fairness demonstrated on the generated sequences, which is evaluated only on the outputs while agnostic to the prompts and models used. The second is the inherent fairness of the generative AI model, which requires that fairness be manifested when input prompts are neutral, that is, they do not explicitly instruct the generative AI to produce a particular type of output. We also study relative intersectional fairness to counteract the combinatorial explosion of fairness when considering multiple categories together with lazy fairness enforcement. Finally, fairness monitoring and enforcement are tested against some current generative AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhentao Xu, Mark Jerome Cruz, Matthew Guevara, Tie Wang, Manasi Deshpande, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In customer service technical support, swiftly and accurately retrieving relevant past issues is critical for efficiently resolving customer inquiries. The conventional retrieval methods in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) treat a large corpus of past issue tracking tickets as plain text, ignoring the crucial intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations, which limits performance. We introduce a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph (KG). Our method constructs a KG from historical issues for use in retrieval, retaining the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations. During the question-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries and retrieves related sub-graphs from the KG to generate answers. This integration of a KG not only improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure information but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of text segmentation. Empirical assessments on our benchmark datasets, utilizing key retrieval (MRR, Recall@K, NDCG@K) and text generation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) metrics, reveal that our method outperforms the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by 0.32 in BLEU. Our method has been deployed within LinkedIn's customer service team for approximately six months and has reduced the median per-issue resolution time by 28.6%.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional performance across a multitude of natural language process tasks, and have been widely applied in various fields. However, the application of large language models in the Intellectual Property (IP) space is challenging due to the strong need for specialized knowledge, privacy protection, processing of extremely long text in this field. In this technical report, we present for the first time a low-cost, standardized procedure for training IP-oriented LLMs, meeting the unique requirements of the IP domain. Using this standard process, we have trained the PatentGPT series models based on open-source pretrained models. By evaluating them on the open-source IP-oriented benchmark MOZIP, our domain-specific LLMs outperforms GPT-4, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed training procedure and the expertise of the PatentGPT models in the IP demain. What is impressive is that our model significantly outperformed GPT-4 on the 2019 China Patent Agent Qualification Examination by achieving a score of 65, reaching the level of human experts. Additionally, the PatentGPT model, which utilizes the SMoE architecture, achieves performance comparable to that of GPT-4 in the IP domain and demonstrates a better cost-performance ratio on long-text tasks, potentially serving as an alternative to GPT-4 within the IP domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mladjan Jovanovic, Peter Voss</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental learning is the ability of systems to acquire knowledge over time, enabling their adaptation and generalization to novel tasks. It is a critical ability for intelligent, real-world systems, especially when data changes frequently or is limited. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of incremental learning in Large Language Models. It synthesizes the state-of-the-art incremental learning paradigms, including continual learning, meta-learning, parameter-efficient learning, and mixture-of-experts learning. We demonstrate their utility for incremental learning by describing specific achievements from these related topics and their critical factors. An important finding is that many of these approaches do not update the core model, and none of them update incrementally in real-time. The paper highlights current problems and challenges for future research in the field. By consolidating the latest relevant research developments, this review offers a comprehensive understanding of incremental learning and its implications for designing and developing LLM-based learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeon-Ji Song, Suhyung Choi, Jaein Kim, Jin-Hwa Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human perception involves discerning complex multi-object scenes into time-static object appearance (ie, size, shape, color) and time-varying object motion (ie, location, velocity, acceleration). This innate ability to unconsciously understand the environment is the motivation behind the success of dynamics modeling. Object-centric representations have emerged as a promising tool for dynamics prediction, yet they primarily focus on the objects' appearance, often overlooking other crucial attributes. In this paper, we propose Object-Centric Kinematics (OCK), a framework for dynamics prediction leveraging object-centric representations. Our model utilizes a novel component named object kinematics, which comprises low-level structured states of objects' position, velocity, and acceleration. The object kinematics are obtained via either implicit or explicit approaches, enabling comprehensive spatiotemporal object reasoning, and integrated through various transformer mechanisms, facilitating effective object-centric dynamics modeling. Our model demonstrates superior performance when handling objects and backgrounds in complex scenes characterized by a wide range of object attributes and dynamic movements. Moreover, our model demonstrates generalization capabilities across diverse synthetic environments, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in vision-related tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyang Zhang, Yake Wei, Zongbo Han, Huazhu Fu, Xi Peng, Cheng Deng, Qinghua Hu, Cai Xu, Jie Wen, Di Hu, Changqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal fusion focuses on integrating information from multiple modalities with the goal of more accurate prediction, which has achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of scenarios, including autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. However, the reliability of multimodal fusion remains largely unexplored especially under low-quality data settings. This paper surveys the common challenges and recent advances of multimodal fusion in the wild and presents them in a comprehensive taxonomy. From a data-centric view, we identify four main challenges that are faced by multimodal fusion on low-quality data, namely (1) noisy multimodal data that are contaminated with heterogeneous noises, (2) incomplete multimodal data that some modalities are missing, (3) imbalanced multimodal data that the qualities or properties of different modalities are significantly different and (4) quality-varying multimodal data that the quality of each modality dynamically changes with respect to different samples. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to understand the state of the field and identify several potential directions. We also provide discussion for the open problems in this field together with interesting future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Chen, Jingwen He, Xinqi Lin, Yu Qiao, Chao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) on images has significantly progressed over the last several years, while real-world video face restoration (VFR), which is more challenging for more complex face motions such as moving gaze directions and facial orientations involved, remains unsolved. Typical BFR methods are evaluated on privately synthesized datasets or self-collected real-world low-quality face images, which are limited in their coverage of real-world video frames. In this work, we introduced new real-world datasets named FOS with a taxonomy of "Full, Occluded, and Side" faces from mainly video frames to study the applicability of current methods on videos. Compared with existing test datasets, FOS datasets cover more diverse degradations and involve face samples from more complex scenarios, which helps to revisit current face restoration approaches more comprehensively. Given the established datasets, we benchmarked both the state-of-the-art BFR methods and the video super resolution (VSR) methods to comprehensively study current approaches, identifying their potential and limitations in VFR tasks. In addition, we studied the effectiveness of the commonly used image quality assessment (IQA) metrics and face IQA (FIQA) metrics by leveraging a subjective user study. With extensive experimental results and detailed analysis provided, we gained insights from the successes and failures of both current BFR and VSR methods. These results also pose challenges to current face restoration approaches, which we hope stimulate future advances in VFR research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Liu, Mingxin Huang, Hao Yan, Linger Deng, Weijia Wu, Hao Lu, Chunhua Shen, Lianwen Jin, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization. In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks. Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters. The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task. Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm. Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500. For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data. We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.

<p>Abstract: Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to automatically comprehend unusual occurrences in videos, thereby enabling various applications such as traffic surveillance and industrial manufacturing. While existing VAU benchmarks primarily concentrate on anomaly detection and localization, our focus is on more practicality, prompting us to raise the following crucial questions: "what anomaly occurred?", "why did it happen?", and "how severe is this abnormal event?". In pursuit of these answers, we present a comprehensive benchmark for Causation Understanding of Video Anomaly (CUVA). Specifically, each instance of the proposed benchmark involves three sets of human annotations to indicate the "what", "why" and "how" of an anomaly, including 1) anomaly type, start and end times, and event descriptions, 2) natural language explanations for the cause of an anomaly, and 3) free text reflecting the effect of the abnormality. In addition, we also introduce MMEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to better align with human preferences for CUVA, facilitating the measurement of existing LLMs in comprehending the underlying cause and corresponding effect of video anomalies. Finally, we propose a novel prompt-based method that can serve as a baseline approach for the challenging CUVA. We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of our evaluation metric and the prompt-based approach. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/fesvhtr/CUVA.</p>

<p>Abstract: There are a thousand ways to caption an image. Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption to a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the diverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent Language Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could match an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the method and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixun Jiao, Xihan Wang, Quanli Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing a hand mesh from a single RGB image is a challenging task because hands are often occluded by objects. Most previous works attempted to introduce more additional information and adopt attention mechanisms to improve 3D reconstruction results, but it would increased computational complexity. This observation prompts us to propose a new and concise architecture while improving computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a simple and effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network HandSSCA, which is the first to incorporate state space modeling into the field of hand pose estimation. In the network, we have designed a novel state space channel attention module that extends the effective sensory field, extracts hand features in the spatial dimension, and enhances hand regional features in the channel dimension. This design helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets featuring challenging hand-object occlusions (such as FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandSSCA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameter count.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose TRAMBA, a hybrid transformer and Mamba architecture for acoustic and bone conduction speech enhancement, suitable for mobile and wearable platforms. Bone conduction speech enhancement has been impractical to adopt in mobile and wearable platforms for several reasons: (i) data collection is labor-intensive, resulting in scarcity; (ii) there exists a performance gap between state of-art models with memory footprints of hundreds of MBs and methods better suited for resource-constrained systems. To adapt TRAMBA to vibration-based sensing modalities, we pre-train TRAMBA with audio speech datasets that are widely available. Then, users fine-tune with a small amount of bone conduction data. TRAMBA outperforms state-of-art GANs by up to 7.3% in PESQ and 1.8% in STOI, with an order of magnitude smaller memory footprint and an inference speed up of up to 465 times. We integrate TRAMBA into real systems and show that TRAMBA (i) improves battery life of wearables by up to 160% by requiring less data sampling and transmission; (ii) generates higher quality voice in noisy environments than over-the-air speech; (iii) requires a memory footprint of less than 20.0 MB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yu, Yufei Wang, Song Xia, Wenhan Yang, Shijian Lu, Yap-Peng Tan, Alex C. Kot</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearnable examples (UEs) seek to maximize testing error by making subtle modifications to training examples that are correctly labeled. Defenses against these poisoning attacks can be categorized based on whether specific interventions are adopted during training. The first approach is training-time defense, such as adversarial training, which can mitigate poisoning effects but is computationally intensive. The other approach is pre-training purification, e.g., image short squeezing, which consists of several simple compressions but often encounters challenges in dealing with various UEs. Our work provides a novel disentanglement mechanism to build an efficient pre-training purification method. Firstly, we uncover rate-constrained variational autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrating a clear tendency to suppress the perturbations in UEs. We subsequently conduct a theoretical analysis for this phenomenon. Building upon these insights, we introduce a disentangle variational autoencoder (D-VAE), capable of disentangling the perturbations with learnable class-wise embeddings. Based on this network, a two-stage purification approach is naturally developed. The first stage focuses on roughly eliminating perturbations, while the second stage produces refined, poison-free results, ensuring effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a 100-class ImageNet-subset. Code is available at https://github.com/yuyi-sd/D-VAE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Tang, Qian Chen, Rong Yu, Xiaohuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tushar Verma, Jyotsna Singh, Yash Bhartari, Rishi Jarwal, Suraj Singh, Shubhkarman Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Small object detection in aerial imagery presents significant challenges in computer vision due to the minimal data inherent in small-sized objects and their propensity to be obscured by larger objects and background noise. Traditional methods using transformer-based models often face limitations stemming from the lack of specialized databases, which adversely affect their performance with objects of varying orientations and scales. This underscores the need for more adaptable, lightweight models. In response, this paper introduces two innovative approaches that significantly enhance detection and segmentation capabilities for small aerial objects. Firstly, we explore the use of the SAHI framework on the newly introduced lightweight YOLO v9 architecture, which utilizes Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) to reduce the substantial information loss typically encountered in sequential feature extraction processes. The paper employs the Vision Mamba model, which incorporates position embeddings to facilitate precise location-aware visual understanding, combined with a novel bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) for effective visual context modeling. This State Space Model adeptly harnesses the linear complexity of CNNs and the global receptive field of Transformers, making it particularly effective in remote sensing image classification. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy and processing efficiency, validating the applicability of these approaches for real-time small object detection across diverse aerial scenarios. This paper also discusses how these methodologies could serve as foundational models for future advancements in aerial object recognition technologies.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01843">Closing the Gap: Achieving Global Convergence (Last Iterate) of Actor-Critic under Markovian Sampling with Neural Network Parametrization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mudit Gaur, Amrit Singh Bedi, Di Wang, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: The current state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms significantly lags in addressing the practical aspects of AC implementations. This crucial gap needs bridging to bring the analysis in line with practical implementations of AC. To address this, we advocate for considering the MMCLG criteria: \textbf{M}ulti-layer neural network parametrization for actor/critic, \textbf{M}arkovian sampling, \textbf{C}ontinuous state-action spaces, the performance of the \textbf{L}ast iterate, and \textbf{G}lobal optimality. These aspects are practically significant and have been largely overlooked in existing theoretical analyses of AC algorithms. In this work, we address these gaps by providing the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of AC algorithms that encompasses all five crucial practical aspects (covers MMCLG criteria). We establish global convergence sample complexity bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left({\epsilon^{-3}}\right)$. We achieve this result through our novel use of the weak gradient domination property of MDP's and our unique analysis of the error in critic estimation.</p>
