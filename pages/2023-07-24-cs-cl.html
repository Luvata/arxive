<p>Pre-trained transformer language models (LMs) have in recent years become the
dominant paradigm in applied NLP. These models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on tasks such as information extraction, question answering,
sentiment analysis, document classification and many others. In the biomedical
domain, significant progress has been made in adapting this paradigm to NLP
tasks that require the integration of domain-specific knowledge as well as
statistical modelling of language. In particular, research in this area has
focused on the question of how best to construct LMs that take into account not
only the patterns of token distribution in medical text, but also the wealth of
structured information contained in terminology resources such as the UMLS.
This work contributes a data-centric paradigm for enriching the language
representations of biomedical transformer-encoder LMs by extracting text
sequences from the UMLS. This allows for graph-based learning objectives to be
combined with masked-language pre-training. Preliminary results from
experiments in the extension of pre-trained LMs as well as training from
scratch show that this framework improves downstream performance on multiple
biomedical and clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.

<p>Jina Embeddings constitutes a set of high-performance sentence embedding
models adept at translating various textual inputs into numerical
representations, thereby capturing the semantic essence of the text. While
these models are not exclusively designed for text generation, they excel in
applications such as dense retrieval and semantic textual similarity. This
paper details the development of Jina Embeddings, starting with the creation of
a high-quality pairwise and triplet dataset. It underlines the crucial role of
data cleaning in dataset preparation, gives in-depth insights into the model

<p>Language models (LMs) like BERT and GPT have revolutionized natural language
processing (NLP). However, privacy-sensitive domains, particularly the medical
field, face challenges to train LMs due to limited data access and privacy
constraints imposed by regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that enables
collaborative learning while ensuring the preservation of data privacy. In this
study, we systematically evaluate FL in medicine across $2$ biomedical NLP
tasks using $6$ LMs encompassing $8$ corpora. Our results showed that: 1) FL
models consistently outperform LMs trained on individual client's data and
sometimes match the model trained with polled data; 2) With the fixed number of
total data, LMs trained using FL with more clients exhibit inferior
performance, but pre-trained transformer-based models exhibited greater
resilience. 3) LMs trained using FL perform nearly on par with the model
trained with pooled data when clients' data are IID distributed while
exhibiting visible gaps with non-IID data. Our code is available at:

<p>Open-domain question answering (QA) tasks usually require the retrieval of
relevant information from a large corpus to generate accurate answers. We
propose a novel approach called Generator-Retriever-Generator (GRG) that
combines document retrieval techniques with a large language model (LLM), by
first prompting the model to generate contextual documents based on a given
question. In parallel, a dual-encoder network retrieves documents that are
relevant to the question from an external corpus. The generated and retrieved
documents are then passed to the second LLM, which generates the final answer.
By combining document retrieval and LLM generation, our approach addresses the
challenges of open-domain QA, such as generating informative and contextually
relevant answers. GRG outperforms the state-of-the-art generate-then-read and
retrieve-then-read pipelines (GENREAD and RFiD) improving their performance at
least by +5.2, +4.2, and +1.6 on TriviaQA, NQ, and WebQ datasets, respectively.

<p>Recent vision-language models outperform vision-only models on many image
classification tasks. However, because of the absence of paired text/image
descriptions, it remains difficult to fine-tune these models for fine-grained
image classification. In this work, we propose a method, GIST, for generating
image-specific fine-grained text descriptions from image-only datasets, and
show that these text descriptions can be used to improve classification. Key
parts of our method include 1. prompting a pretrained large language model with
domain-specific prompts to generate diverse fine-grained text descriptions for
each class and 2. using a pretrained vision-language model to match each image
to label-preserving text descriptions that capture relevant visual features in
the image. We demonstrate the utility of GIST by fine-tuning vision-language
models on the image-and-generated-text pairs to learn an aligned
vision-language representation space for improved classification. We evaluate
our learned representation space in full-shot and few-shot scenarios across
four diverse fine-grained classification datasets, each from a different
domain. Our method achieves an average improvement of $4.1\%$ in accuracy over
CLIP linear probes and an average of $1.1\%$ improvement in accuracy over the
previous state-of-the-art image-text classification method on the full-shot
datasets. Our method achieves similar improvements across few-shot regimes.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11316">Making Pre-trained Language Models both Task-solvers and Self-calibrators. (arXiv:2307.11316v1 [cs.CL])</a></h1>

<p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) serve as backbones for various real-world
systems. For high-stake applications, it's equally essential to have reasonable
confidence estimations in predictions. While the vanilla confidence scores of
PLMs can already be effectively utilized, PLMs consistently become
overconfident in their wrong predictions, which is not desirable in practice.
Previous work shows that introducing an extra calibration task can mitigate
this issue. The basic idea involves acquiring additional data to train models
in predicting the confidence of their initial predictions. However, it only
demonstrates the feasibility of this kind of method, assuming that there are
abundant extra available samples for the introduced calibration task. In this
work, we consider the practical scenario that we need to effectively utilize
training samples to make PLMs both task-solvers and self-calibrators. Three
challenges are presented, including limited training samples, data imbalance,
and distribution shifts. We first conduct pilot experiments to quantify various
decisive factors in the calibration task. Based on the empirical analysis
results, we propose a training algorithm LM-TOAST to tackle the challenges.
Experimental results show that LM-TOAST can effectively utilize the training
data to make PLMs have reasonable confidence estimations while maintaining the
original task performance. Further, we consider three downstream applications,
namely selective classification, adversarial defense, and model cascading, to
show the practical usefulness of LM-TOAST. The code will be made public at

<p>Participant recruitment based on unstructured medical texts such as clinical
notes and radiology reports has been a challenging yet important task for the
cohort establishment in clinical research. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT have achieved tremendous success in various downstream
tasks thanks to their promising performance in language understanding,
inference, and generation. It is then natural to test their feasibility in
solving the cohort recruitment task, which involves the classification of a
given paragraph of medical text into disease label(s). However, when applied to
knowledge-intensive problem settings such as medical text classification, where
the LLMs are expected to understand the decision made by human experts and
accurately identify the implied disease labels, the LLMs show a mediocre
performance. A possible explanation is that, by only using the medical text,
the LLMs neglect to use the rich context of additional information that
languages afford. To this end, we propose to use a knowledge graph as auxiliary
information to guide the LLMs in making predictions. Moreover, to further boost
the LLMs adapt to the problem setting, we apply a chain-of-thought (CoT) sample
selection strategy enhanced by reinforcement learning, which selects a set of
CoT samples given each individual medical report. Experimental results and
various ablation studies show that our few-shot learning method achieves
satisfactory performance compared with fine-tuning strategies and gains superb
advantages when the available data is limited. The code and sample dataset of
the proposed CohortGPT model is available at:

<p>The remarkable capabilities of large-scale language models, such as ChatGPT,
in text generation have incited awe and spurred researchers to devise detectors
to mitigate potential risks, including misinformation, phishing, and academic
dishonesty. Despite this, most previous studies, including HC3, have been
predominantly geared towards creating detectors that differentiate between
purely ChatGPT-generated texts and human-authored texts. This approach,
however, fails to work on discerning texts generated through human-machine
collaboration, such as ChatGPT-polished texts. Addressing this gap, we
introduce a novel dataset termed HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts),
facilitating the construction of more robust detectors. It diverges from extant
corpora by comprising pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-polished abstracts
instead of purely ChatGPT-generated texts. Additionally, we propose the "Polish
Ratio" method, an innovative measure of ChatGPT's involvement in text
generation based on editing distance. It provides a mechanism to measure the
degree of human originality in the resulting text. Our experimental results
show our proposed model has better robustness on the HPPT dataset and two
existing datasets (HC3 and CDB). Furthermore, the "Polish Ratio" we proposed
offers a more comprehensive explanation by quantifying the degree of ChatGPT
involvement, which indicates that a Polish Ratio value greater than 0.2
signifies ChatGPT involvement and a value exceeding 0.6 implies that ChatGPT
generates most of the text.

<p>MeetEval is an open-source toolkit to evaluate all kinds of meeting
transcription systems. It provides a unified interface for the computation of
commonly used Word Error Rates (WERs), specifically cpWER, ORC WER and MIMO WER
along other WER definitions. We extend the cpWER computation by a temporal
constraint to ensure that only words are identified as correct when the
temporal alignment is plausible. This leads to a better quality of the matching
of the hypothesis string to the reference string that more closely resembles
the actual transcription quality, and a system is penalized if it provides poor
time annotations. Since word-level timing information is often not available,
we present a way to approximate exact word-level timings from segment-level
timings (e.g., a sentence) and show that the approximation leads to a similar
WER as a matching with exact word-level annotations. At the same time, the time
constraint leads to a speedup of the matching algorithm, which outweighs the
additional overhead caused by processing the time stamps.

<p>Traditional topic identification solutions from audio rely on an automatic
speech recognition system (ASR) to produce transcripts used as input to a
text-based model. These approaches work well in high-resource scenarios, where
there are sufficient data to train both components of the pipeline. However, in
low-resource situations, the ASR system, even if available, produces
low-quality transcripts, leading to a bad text-based classifier. Moreover,
spontaneous speech containing hesitations can further degrade the performance
of the ASR model. In this paper, we investigate alternatives to the standard
text-only solutions by comparing audio-only and hybrid techniques of jointly
utilising text and audio features. The models evaluated on spontaneous Finnish
speech demonstrate that purely audio-based solutions are a viable option when
ASR components are not available, while the hybrid multi-modal solutions
achieve the best results.

<p>Parameter Efficient Tuning (PET) has gained attention for reducing the number
of parameters while maintaining performance and providing better hardware
resource savings, but few studies investigate dense prediction tasks and
interaction between modalities. In this paper, we do an investigation of
efficient tuning problems on referring image segmentation. We propose a novel
adapter called Bridger to facilitate cross-modal information exchange and
inject task-specific information into the pre-trained model. We also design a
lightweight decoder for image segmentation. Our approach achieves comparable or
superior performance with only 1.61\% to 3.38\% backbone parameter updates,
evaluated on challenging benchmarks. The code is available at

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11558">Advancing Visual Grounding with Scene Knowledge: Benchmark and Method. (arXiv:2307.11558v1 [cs.CV])</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chen_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zhihong Chen</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhang_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ruifei Zhang</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Song_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yibing Song</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wan_X/0/1/0/all/0/1">Xiang Wan</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Li_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">Guanbin Li</a></p>
<p>Visual grounding (VG) aims to establish fine-grained alignment between vision
and language. Ideally, it can be a testbed for vision-and-language models to
evaluate their understanding of the images and texts and their reasoning
abilities over their joint space. However, most existing VG datasets are
constructed using simple description texts, which do not require sufficient
reasoning over the images and texts. This has been demonstrated in a recent
study~\cite{luo2022goes}, where a simple LSTM-based text encoder without
pretraining can achieve state-of-the-art performance on mainstream VG datasets.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel benchmark of \underline{S}cene
\underline{K}nowledge-guided \underline{V}isual \underline{G}rounding (SK-VG),
where the image content and referring expressions are not sufficient to ground
the target objects, forcing the models to have a reasoning ability on the
long-form scene knowledge. To perform this task, we propose two approaches to
accept the triple-type input, where the former embeds knowledge into the image
features before the image-query interaction; the latter leverages linguistic
structure to assist in computing the image-text matching. We conduct extensive
experiments to analyze the above methods and show that the proposed approaches
achieve promising results but still leave room for improvement, including
performance and interpretability. The dataset and code are available at

<p>Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a challenging task. In this paper, we
introduce a modality conversion concept aimed at enhancing emotion recognition
performance on the MELD dataset. We assess our approach through two
experiments: first, a method named Modality-Conversion that employs automatic
speech recognition (ASR) systems, followed by a text classifier; second, we
assume perfect ASR output and investigate the impact of modality conversion on
SER, this method is called Modality-Conversion++. Our findings indicate that
the first method yields substantial results, while the second method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech-based approaches in terms of SER
weighted-F1 (WF1) score on the MELD dataset. This research highlights the
potential of modality conversion for tasks that can be conducted in alternative
modalities.

<p>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) focuses on representing the entities and
relations of a knowledge graph (KG) into the continuous vector spaces, which
can be employed to predict the missing triples to achieve knowledge graph
completion (KGC). However, KGE models often only briefly learn structural
correlations of triple data and embeddings would be misled by the trivial
patterns and noisy links in real-world KGs. To address this issue, we build the
new paradigm of KGE in the context of causality and embedding disentanglement.
We further propose a Causality-enhanced knowledge graph Embedding (CausE)
framework. CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of
the confounder embeddings and design new training objectives to make stable
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CausE could outperform the
baseline models and achieve state-of-the-art KGC performance. We release our
code in https://github.com/zjukg/CausE.

<p>This paper presents OxfordTVG-HIC (Humorous Image Captions), a large-scale
dataset for humour generation and understanding. Humour is an abstract,
subjective, and context-dependent cognitive construct involving several
cognitive factors, making it a challenging task to generate and interpret.
Hence, humour generation and understanding can serve as a new task for
evaluating the ability of deep-learning methods to process abstract and
subjective information. Due to the scarcity of data, humour-related generation
tasks such as captioning remain under-explored. To address this gap,
OxfordTVG-HIC offers approximately 2.9M image-text pairs with humour scores to
train a generalizable humour captioning model. Contrary to existing captioning
datasets, OxfordTVG-HIC features a wide range of emotional and semantic
diversity resulting in out-of-context examples that are particularly conducive
to generating humour. Moreover, OxfordTVG-HIC is curated devoid of offensive
content. We also show how OxfordTVG-HIC can be leveraged for evaluating the
humour of a generated text. Through explainability analysis of the trained
models, we identify the visual and linguistic cues influential for evoking
humour prediction (and generation). We observe qualitatively that these cues
are aligned with the benign violation theory of humour in cognitive psychology.

<p>Contrastive pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have
revolutionized visual representation learning by providing good performance on
downstream datasets. VLMs are 0-shot adapted to a downstream dataset by
designing prompts that are relevant to the dataset. Such prompt engineering
makes use of domain expertise and a validation dataset. Meanwhile, recent
developments in generative pretrained models like GPT-4 mean they can be used
as advanced internet search tools. They can also be manipulated to provide
visual information in any structure. In this work, we show that GPT-4 can be
used to generate text that is visually descriptive and how this can be used to
adapt CLIP to downstream tasks. We show considerable improvements in 0-shot
transfer accuracy on specialized fine-grained datasets like EuroSAT (~7%), DTD
(~7%), SUN397 (~4.6%), and CUB (~3.3%) when compared to CLIP's default prompt.
We also design a simple few-shot adapter that learns to choose the best
possible sentences to construct generalizable classifiers that outperform the
recently proposed CoCoOP by ~2% on average and by over 4% on 4 specialized
fine-grained datasets. We will release the code, prompts, and auxiliary text

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved human-level fluency in text
generation, making it difficult to distinguish between human-written and
LLM-generated texts. This poses a growing risk of misuse of LLMs and demands
the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. However, existing
detectors degrade detection accuracy by simply paraphrasing LLM-generated
texts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these detectors in real-life
situations, such as when students use LLMs for writing homework assignments
(e.g., essays) and quickly learn how to evade these detectors, has not been
explored. In this paper, we propose OUTFOX, a novel framework that improves the
robustness of LLM-generated-text detectors by allowing both the detector and
the attacker to consider each other's output and apply this to the domain of
student essays. In our framework, the attacker uses the detector's prediction
labels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essays
that are harder to detect. While the detector uses the adversarially generated
essays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from a
strong attacker. Our experiments show that our proposed detector learned
in-context from the attacker improves the detection performance on the attacked
dataset by up to +41.3 point F1-score. While our proposed attacker can
drastically degrade the performance of the detector by up to -57.0 point
F1-score compared to the paraphrasing method.

<p>This research studies the impact of online news on social and economic
consumer perceptions through semantic network analysis. Using over 1.8 million
online articles on Italian media covering four years, we calculate the semantic
importance of specific economic-related keywords to see if words appearing in
the articles could anticipate consumers' judgments about the economic situation
and the Consumer Confidence Index. We use an innovative approach to analyze big
textual data, combining methods and tools of text mining and social network
analysis. Results show a strong predictive power for the judgments about the
current households and national situation. Our indicator offers a complementary
approach to estimating consumer confidence, lessening the limitations of
traditional survey-based methods.

<p>Multi-hop machine reading comprehension is a challenging task in natural
language processing as it requires more reasoning ability across multiple
documents. Spectral models based on graph convolutional networks have shown
good inferring abilities and lead to competitive results. However, the analysis
and reasoning of some are inconsistent with those of humans. Inspired by the
concept of grandmother cells in cognitive neuroscience, we propose a
heterogeneous graph attention network model named ClueReader to imitate the
grandmother cell concept. The model is designed to assemble the semantic
features in multi-level representations and automatically concentrate or
alleviate information for reasoning through the attention mechanism. The name
ClueReader is a metaphor for the pattern of the model: it regards the subjects
of queries as the starting points of clues, takes the reasoning entities as
bridge points, considers the latent candidate entities as grandmother cells,
and the clues end up in candidate entities. The proposed model enables the
visualization of the reasoning graph, making it possible to analyze the
importance of edges connecting entities and the selectivity in the mention and
candidate nodes, which is easier to comprehend empirically. Evaluations on the
open-domain multi-hop reading dataset WikiHop and drug-drug interaction dataset
MedHop proved the validity of ClueReader and showed the feasibility of its
application of the model in the molecular biology domain.

<p>Methods for making high-quality recommendations often rely on learning latent
representations from interaction data. These methods, while performant, do not
provide ready mechanisms for users to control the recommendation they receive.
Our work tackles this problem by proposing LACE, a novel concept value
bottleneck model for controllable text recommendations. LACE represents each
user with a succinct set of human-readable concepts through retrieval given
user-interacted documents and learns personalized representations of the
concepts based on user documents. This concept based user profile is then
leveraged to make recommendations. The design of our model affords control over
the recommendations through a number of intuitive interactions with a
transparent user profile. We first establish the quality of recommendations
obtained from LACE in an offline evaluation on three recommendation tasks
spanning six datasets in warm-start, cold-start, and zero-shot setups. Next, we
validate the controllability of LACE under simulated user interactions.
Finally, we implement LACE in an interactive controllable recommender system
and conduct a user study to demonstrate that users are able to improve the
quality of recommendations they receive through interactions with an editable
user profile.

<p>This study proposes a multitask learning architecture for extractive
summarization with coherence boosting. The architecture contains an extractive
summarizer and coherent discriminator module. The coherent discriminator is
trained online on the sentence vectors of the augmented textual input, thus
improving its general ability of judging whether the input sentences are
coherent. Meanwhile, we maximize the coherent scores from the coherent
discriminator by updating the parameters of the summarizer. To make the
extractive sentences trainable in a differentiable manner, we introduce two
strategies, including pre-trained converting model (model-based) and converting
matrix (MAT-based) that merge sentence representations. Experiments show that
our proposed method significantly improves the proportion of consecutive
sentences in the extracted summaries based on their positions in the original
article (i.e., automatic sentence-level coherence metric), while the goodness

<p>Narrative-driven recommendation (NDR) presents an information access problem
where users solicit recommendations with verbose descriptions of their
preferences and context, for example, travelers soliciting recommendations for
points of interest while describing their likes/dislikes and travel
circumstances. These requests are increasingly important with the rise of
natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation
systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current
platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical
user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which
often describe user preferences and context - this may be used to bootstrap
training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models
(LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring
synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with few-shot prompting
and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item
interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective
strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other
retrieval and LLM baselines for narrative-driven recommendation.

<p>Artificial intelligence researchers have made significant advances in legal
intelligence in recent years. However, the existing studies have not focused on
the important value embedded in judgments reversals, which limits the
improvement of the efficiency of legal intelligence. In this paper, we propose
a causal Framework for Accurately Inferring case Reversals (FAIR), which models
the problem of judgments reversals based on real Chinese judgments. We mine the
causes of judgments reversals by causal inference methods and inject the
obtained causal relationships into the neural network as a priori knowledge.
And then, our framework is validated on a challenging dataset as a legal
judgment prediction task. The experimental results show that our framework can
tap the most critical factors in judgments reversal, and the obtained causal
relationships can effectively improve the neural network's performance. In
addition, we discuss the generalization ability of large language models for
legal intelligence tasks using ChatGPT as an example. Our experiment has found
that the generalization ability of large language models still has defects, and
mining causal relationships can effectively improve the accuracy and explain
ability of model predictions.

<p>While state-of-the-art NLP models have demonstrated excellent performance for
aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA), substantial evidence has been presented
on their lack of robustness. This is especially manifested as significant
degradation in performance when faced with out-of-distribution data. Recent
solutions that rely on counterfactually augmented datasets show promising
results, but they are inherently limited because of the lack of access to
explicit causal structure. In this paper, we present an alternative approach
that relies on non-counterfactual data augmentation. Our proposal instead
relies on using noisy, cost-efficient data augmentations that preserve
semantics associated with the target aspect. Our approach then relies on
modelling invariances between different versions of the data to improve
robustness. A comprehensive suite of experiments shows that our proposal
significantly improves upon strong pre-trained baselines on both standard and
robustness-specific datasets. Our approach further establishes a new
state-of-the-art on the ABSA robustness benchmark and transfers well across
domains.

<p>Entity-level fine-grained sentiment analysis in the financial domain is a
crucial subtask of sentiment analysis and currently faces numerous challenges.
The primary challenge stems from the lack of high-quality and large-scale
annotated corpora specifically designed for financial text sentiment analysis,
which in turn limits the availability of data necessary for developing
effective text processing techniques. Recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance in natural language
processing tasks, primarily centered around language pattern matching. In this
paper, we propose a novel and extensive Chinese fine-grained financial
sentiment analysis dataset, FinChina SA, for enterprise early warning. We
thoroughly evaluate and experiment with well-known existing open-source LLMs
using our dataset. We firmly believe that our dataset will serve as a valuable
resource to advance the exploration of real-world financial sentiment analysis
tasks, which should be the focus of future research. Our dataset and all code
to replicate the experimental results will be released.

<p>Relation extraction (RE) is a crucial task in natural language processing
(NLP) that aims to identify and classify relationships between entities
mentioned in text. In the financial domain, relation extraction plays a vital
role in extracting valuable information from financial documents, such as news
articles, earnings reports, and company filings. This paper describes our
solution to relation extraction on one such dataset REFinD. The dataset was
released along with shared task as a part of the Fourth Workshop on Knowledge
Discovery from Unstructured Data in Financial Services, co-located with SIGIR
2023. In this paper, we employed OpenAI models under the framework of
in-context learning (ICL). We utilized two retrieval strategies to find top K
relevant in-context learning demonstrations / examples from training data for a
given test example. The first retrieval mechanism, we employed, is a
learning-free dense retriever and the other system is a learning-based
retriever. We were able to achieve 3rd rank overall. Our best F1-score is
0.718.

<p>Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a
core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent works
primarily focus on using advanced natural language processing techniques to
extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based
methods derived from local historical news. However, this approach lacks a
global perspective, failing to account for users' hidden motivations and
behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel model called GLORY (Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which
combines global representations learned from other users with local
representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish
this by constructing a Global-aware Historical News Encoder, which includes a
global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to enrich news
representations, thereby fusing historical news representations by a historical
news aggregator. Similarly, we extend this approach to a Global Candidate News
Encoder, utilizing a global entity graph and a candidate news aggregator to
enhance candidate news representation. Evaluation results on two public news
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.
Furthermore, our model offers more diverse recommendations.

<p>In the complex domain of large language models (LLMs), striking a balance
between computational efficiency and maintaining model quality is a formidable
challenge. Navigating the inherent limitations of uniform quantization,
particularly when dealing with outliers, and motivated by the launch of
NVIDIA's H100 hardware, this study delves into the viability of floating-point
(FP) quantization, particularly focusing on FP8 and FP4, as a potential
solution. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that for LLMs, FP8 activation
consistently outshines its integer (INT8) equivalent, with the performance edge
becoming more noticeable in models possessing parameters beyond one billion.
For weight quantization, our findings indicate that FP4 exhibits comparable, if
not superior, performance to INT4, simplifying deployment on FP-supported
hardware like H100. To mitigate the overhead from precision alignment caused by
the disparity between weights and activations, we propose two scaling
constraints for weight quantization that negligibly impact the performance
compared to the standard W4A8 model. We additionally enhance our quantization
methods by integrating the Low Rank Compensation (LoRC) strategy, yielding
improvements especially in smaller models. The results of our investigation
emphasize the immense potential of FP quantization for LLMs, paving the way for
high-efficiency deployment in resource-limited settings.

<p>Information extraction(IE) is a crucial subfield within natural language
processing. However, for the traditionally segmented approach to sentence
classification and Named Entity Recognition, the intricate interactions between
these individual subtasks remain largely uninvestigated. In this study, we
propose an integrative analysis, converging sentence classification with Named
Entity Recognition, with the objective to unveil and comprehend the mutual
reinforcement effect within these two information extraction subtasks. To
achieve this, we introduce a Sentence Classification and Named Entity
Recognition Multi-task (SCNM) approach that combines Sentence Classification
(SC) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). We develop a Sentence-to-Label
Generation (SLG) framework for SCNM and construct a Wikipedia dataset
containing both SC and NER. Using a format converter, we unify input formats
and employ a generative model to generate SC-labels, NER-labels, and associated
text segments. We propose a Constraint Mechanism (CM) to improve generated
format accuracy. Our results show SC accuracy increased by 1.13 points and NER
by 1.06 points in SCNM compared to standalone tasks, with CM raising format
accuracy from 63.61 to 100. The findings indicate mutual reinforcement effects
between SC and NER, and integration enhances both tasks' performance. We
additionally implemented the SLG framework on single SC task. It yielded
superior accuracies compared to the baseline on two distinct Japanese SC
datasets. Notably, in the experiment of few-shot learning, SLG framework shows
much better performance than fine-tune method. These empirical findings
contribute additional evidence to affirm the efficacy of the SLG framework.

instruction injection in multi-modal LLMs. An attacker generates an adversarial
perturbation corresponding to the prompt and blends it into an image or audio
recording. When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the
perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the
attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker's
instruction. We illustrate this attack with several proof-of-concept examples
targeting LLaVa and PandaGPT.
