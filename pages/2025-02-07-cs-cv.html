<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous systems, yet LiDAR fiducial markers (LFMs) lag behind visual fiducial markers (VFMs) in adoption and utility. Bridging this gap is vital for robotics and computer vision but challenging due to the sparse, unstructured nature of 3D LiDAR data and 2D-focused fiducial marker designs. This dissertation proposes a novel framework for mapping and localization using LFMs is proposed to benefit a variety of real-world applications, including the collection of 3D assets and training data for point cloud registration, 3D map merging, Augmented Reality (AR), and many more.
  First, an Intensity Image-based LiDAR Fiducial Marker (IFM) system is introduced, using thin, letter-sized markers compatible with VFMs. A detection method locates 3D fiducials from intensity images, enabling LiDAR pose estimation. Second, an enhanced algorithm extends detection to 3D maps, increasing marker range and facilitating tasks like 3D map merging. This method leverages both intensity and geometry, overcoming limitations of geometry-only detection approaches. Third, a new LFM-based mapping and localization method registers unordered, low-overlap point clouds. It employs adaptive threshold detection and a two-level graph framework to solve a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem, optimizing point cloud and marker poses. Additionally, the Livox-3DMatch dataset is introduced, improving learning-based multiview point cloud registration methods.
  Extensive experiments with various LiDAR models in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03549">Kronecker Mask and Interpretive Prompts are Language-Action Video Learners</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Yang, Zitong Yu, Xiuming Ni, Jia He, Hui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has significantly advanced image-based vision learning. A pressing topic subsequently arises: how can we effectively adapt CLIP to the video domain? Recent studies have focused on adjusting either the textual or visual branch of CLIP for action recognition. However, we argue that adaptations of both branches are crucial. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CLAVER}: a \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{A}ction \textbf{V}ideo Learn\textbf{er}, designed to shift CLIP's focus from the alignment of static visual objects and concrete nouns to the alignment of dynamic action behaviors and abstract verbs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Kronecker mask attention for temporal modeling. Our tailored Kronecker mask offers three benefits 1) it expands the temporal receptive field for each token, 2) it serves as an effective spatiotemporal heterogeneity inductive bias, mitigating the issue of spatiotemporal homogenization, and 3) it can be seamlessly plugged into transformer-based models. Regarding the textual branch, we leverage large language models to generate diverse, sentence-level and semantically rich interpretive prompts of actions, which shift the model's focus towards the verb comprehension. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and learning scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generality of our approach. The code will be available soon.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03553">Efficient Global Neural Architecture Search</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahid Siddiqui, Christos Kyrkou, Theocharis Theocharides</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown promise towards automating neural network design for a given task, but it is computationally demanding due to training costs associated with evaluating a large number of architectures to find the optimal one. To speed up NAS, recent works limit the search to network building blocks (modular search) instead of searching the entire architecture (global search), approximate candidates' performance evaluation in lieu of complete training, and use gradient descent rather than naturally suitable discrete optimization approaches. However, modular search does not determine network's macro architecture i.e. depth and width, demanding manual trial and error post-search, hence lacking automation. In this work, we revisit NAS and design a navigable, yet architecturally diverse, macro-micro search space. In addition, to determine relative rankings of candidates, existing methods employ consistent approximations across entire search spaces, whereas different networks may not be fairly comparable under one training protocol. Hence, we propose an architecture-aware approximation with variable training schemes for different networks. Moreover, we develop an efficient search strategy by disjoining macro-micro network design that yields competitive architectures in terms of both accuracy and size. Our proposed framework achieves a new state-of-the-art on EMNIST and KMNIST, while being highly competitive on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FashionMNIST datasets and being 2-4x faster than the fastest global search methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the transferability of our framework to real-world computer vision problems by discovering competitive architectures for face recognition applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03566">CLIP Behaves like a Bag-of-Words Model Cross-modally but not Uni-modally</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Darina Koishigarina, Arnas Uselis, Seong Joon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) has become a popular choice for various downstream tasks. However, recent studies have questioned its ability to represent compositional concepts effectively. These works suggest that CLIP often acts like a bag-of-words (BoW) model, interpreting images and text as sets of individual concepts without grasping the structural relationships. In particular, CLIP struggles to correctly bind attributes to their corresponding objects when multiple objects are present in an image or text. In this work, we investigate why CLIP exhibits this BoW-like behavior. We find that the correct attribute-object binding information is already present in individual text and image modalities. Instead, the issue lies in the cross-modal alignment, which relies on cosine similarity. To address this, we propose Linear Attribute Binding CLIP or LABCLIP. It applies a linear transformation to text embeddings before computing cosine similarity. This approach significantly improves CLIP's ability to bind attributes to correct objects, thereby enhancing its compositional understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrdad Asadi, Komi Sodok\'e, Ian J. Gerard, Marta Kersten-Oertel</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) image classification that enhances clinical interpretability while maintaining a streamlined, single-model, single-run training pipeline. Leveraging the CheXpert dataset and VisualCheXbert-derived labels, we incorporate hierarchical label groupings to capture clinically meaningful relationships between diagnoses. To achieve this, we designed a custom hierarchical binary cross-entropy (HBCE) loss function that enforces label dependencies using either fixed or data-driven penalty types. Our model achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.903 on the test set. Additionally, we provide visual explanations and uncertainty estimations to further enhance model interpretability. All code, model configurations, and experiment details are made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conor Wallace, Isaac Corley, Jonathan Lwowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining the integrity of solar power plants is a vital component in dealing with the current climate crisis. This process begins with analysts creating a detailed map of a plant with the coordinates of every solar panel, making it possible to quickly locate and mitigate potential faulty solar panels. However, this task is extremely tedious and is not scalable for the ever increasing capacity of solar power across the globe. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for detecting individual solar panels using a rotated object detection architecture. We evaluate our approach on a diverse dataset of solar power plants collected from across the United States and report a mAP score of 83.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danah Yatim, Rafail Fridman, Omer Bar-Tal, Tali Dekel</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method for augmenting real-world videos with newly generated dynamic content. Given an input video and a simple user-provided text instruction describing the desired content, our method synthesizes dynamic objects or complex scene effects that naturally interact with the existing scene over time. The position, appearance, and motion of the new content are seamlessly integrated into the original footage while accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions with other dynamic objects in the scene, resulting in a cohesive and realistic output video. We achieve this via a zero-shot, training-free framework that harnesses a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer to synthesize the new content and a pre-trained Vision Language Model to envision the augmented scene in detail. Specifically, we introduce a novel inference-based method that manipulates features within the attention mechanism, enabling accurate localization and seamless integration of the new content while preserving the integrity of the original scene. Our method is fully automated, requiring only a simple user instruction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of edits applied to real-world videos, encompassing diverse objects and scenarios involving both camera and object motion.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03628">The Hidden Life of Tokens: Reducing Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Visual Information Steering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuowei Li, Haizhou Shi, Yunhe Gao, Di Liu, Zhenting Wang, Yuxiao Chen, Ting Liu, Long Zhao, Hao Wang, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively over both textual and visual inputs, but they tend to hallucinate syntactically coherent yet visually ungrounded contents. In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits rankings throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss -- visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation -- semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information -- visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decided still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by abount 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Sushko, Ayana Bharadwaj, Zhi Yang Lim, Vasily Ilin, Ben Caffee, Dongping Chen, Mohammadreza Salehi, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing image editing models struggle to meet real-world demands. Despite excelling in academic benchmarks, they have yet to be widely adopted for real user needs. Datasets that power these models use artificial edits, lacking the scale and ecological validity necessary to address the true diversity of user requests. We introduce REALEDIT, a large-scale image editing dataset with authentic user requests and human-made edits sourced from Reddit. REALEDIT includes a test set of 9300 examples to evaluate models on real user requests. Our results show that existing models fall short on these tasks, highlighting the need for realistic training data. To address this, we introduce 48K training examples and train our REALEDIT model, achieving substantial gains - outperforming competitors by up to 165 Elo points in human judgment and 92 percent relative improvement on the automated VIEScore metric. We deploy our model on Reddit, testing it on new requests, and receive positive feedback. Beyond image editing, we explore REALEDIT's potential in detecting edited images by partnering with a deepfake detection non-profit. Finetuning their model on REALEDIT data improves its F1-score by 14 percentage points, underscoring the dataset's value for broad applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunuo Chen, Junli Cao, Anil Kag, Vidit Goel, Sergei Korolev, Chenfanfu Jiang, Sergey Tulyakov, Jian Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel video generation framework that integrates 3-dimensional geometry and dynamic awareness. To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, \eg, nonphysical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos. These videos involve complex interactions of solids, where 3D information is essential for perceiving deformation and contact. Furthermore, our model improves the overall quality of video generation by promoting the 3D consistency of moving objects and reducing abrupt changes in shape and motion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huimin Zeng, Jiacheng Li, Ziqiang Zheng, Zhiwei Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual images corrupted by various types and levels of degradations are commonly encountered in practical image compression. However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gian Mario Favero, Parham Saremi, Emily Kaczmarek, Brennan Nichyporuk, Tal Arbel</p>
<p>Abstract: Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harrish Thasarathan, Julian Forsyth, Thomas Fel, Matthew Kowal, Konstantinos Derpanis</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Universal Sparse Autoencoders (USAEs), a framework for uncovering and aligning interpretable concepts spanning multiple pretrained deep neural networks. Unlike existing concept-based interpretability methods, which focus on a single model, USAEs jointly learn a universal concept space that can reconstruct and interpret the internal activations of multiple models at once. Our core insight is to train a single, overcomplete sparse autoencoder (SAE) that ingests activations from any model and decodes them to approximate the activations of any other model under consideration. By optimizing a shared objective, the learned dictionary captures common factors of variation-concepts-across different tasks, architectures, and datasets. We show that USAEs discover semantically coherent and important universal concepts across vision models; ranging from low-level features (e.g., colors and textures) to higher-level structures (e.g., parts and objects). Overall, USAEs provide a powerful new method for interpretable cross-model analysis and offers novel applications, such as coordinated activation maximization, that open avenues for deeper insights in multi-model AI systems</p>

<p>Abstract: Action recognition in dark, low-light (under-exposed) or noisy videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream approach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma correction and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address these challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, extending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting, thereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across different brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal features are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its bidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0 and ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the effectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Zhou, Defang Chen, Can Wang, Chun Chen, Siwei Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality images, but these images often fail to align closely with the given text prompts. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a popular and effective technique for improving text-image alignment in the generative process. However, using CFG introduces significant computational overhead and deviates from the established theoretical foundations of diffusion models. In this paper, we present DIstilling CFG by enhancing text Embeddings (DICE), a novel approach that removes the reliance on CFG in the generative process while maintaining the benefits it provides. DICE distills a CFG-based text-to-image diffusion model into a CFG-free version by refining text embeddings to replicate CFG-based directions. In this way, we avoid the computational and theoretical drawbacks of CFG, enabling high-quality, well-aligned image generation at a fast sampling speed. Extensive experiments on multiple Stable Diffusion v1.5 variants, SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, DICE supports negative prompts for image editing to improve image quality further. Code will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Wang, Yaodong Yu, Guoyizhe Wei, Wei Shao, Yuyin Zhou, Alan Yuille, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT), patchification has long been regarded as a de facto image tokenization approach for plain visual architectures. By compressing the spatial size of images, this approach can effectively shorten the token sequence and reduce the computational cost of ViT-like plain architectures. In this work, we aim to thoroughly examine the information loss caused by this patchification-based compressive encoding paradigm and how it affects visual understanding. We conduct extensive patch size scaling experiments and excitedly observe an intriguing scaling law in patchification: the models can consistently benefit from decreased patch sizes and attain improved predictive performance, until it reaches the minimum patch size of 1x1, i.e., pixel tokenization. This conclusion is broadly applicable across different vision tasks, various input scales, and diverse architectures such as ViT and the recent Mamba models. Moreover, as a by-product, we discover that with smaller patches, task-specific decoder heads become less critical for dense prediction. In the experiments, we successfully scale up the visual sequence to an exceptional length of 50,176 tokens, achieving a competitive test accuracy of 84.6% with a base-sized model on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. We hope this study can provide insights and theoretical foundations for future works of building non-compressive vision models. Code is available at https://github.com/wangf3014/Patch_Scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rupesh Dulal, Rabin Dulal</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the extent of brain tumors is a significant challenge in brain cancer treatment. The main difficulty is in the approximate detection of tumor size. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a critical diagnostic tool. However, manually detecting the boundaries of brain tumors from MRI scans is a labor-intensive task that requires extensive expertise. Deep learning and computer-aided detection techniques have led to notable advances in machine learning for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modified You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model to accurately detect the tumors within the MRI images. The proposed model replaced the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT- DETR) in the detection head. NMS filters out redundant or overlapping bounding boxes in the detected tumors, but they are hand-designed and pre-set. RT-DETR removes hand-designed components. The second improvement was made by replacing the normal convolution block with ghost convolution. Ghost Convolution reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining high accuracy and enabling faster inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The third improvement was made by introducing a vision transformer block in the backbone of YOLOv8 to extract context-aware features. We used a publicly available dataset of brain tumors in the proposed model. The proposed model performed better than the original YOLOv8 model and also performed better than other object detectors (Faster R- CNN, Mask R-CNN, YOLO, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and DETR). The proposed model achieved 0.91 mAP (mean Average Precision)@0.5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Xu, Dawei Zhou, Decheng Liu, Nannan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are found to be vulnerable to adversarial noises. The prompt-based defense has been increasingly studied due to its high efficiency. However, existing prompt-based defenses mainly exploited mixed prompt patterns, where critical patterns closely related to object semantics lack sufficient focus. The phase and amplitude spectra have been proven to be highly related to specific semantic patterns and crucial for robustness. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Phase and Amplitude-aware Prompting (PAP) defense. Specifically, we construct phase-level and amplitude-level prompts for each class, and adjust weights for prompting according to the model's robust performance under these prompts during training. During testing, we select prompts for each image using its predicted label to obtain the prompted image, which is inputted to the model to get the final prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nhat-Tan Do, Nhi Ngoc-Yen Nguyen, Dieu-Phuong Nguyen, Trong-Hop Do</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in UAV-based video is challenging due to variations in viewpoint, low resolution, and the presence of small objects. While other research on MOT dedicated to aerial videos primarily focuses on the academic aspect by developing sophisticated algorithms, there is a lack of attention to the practical aspect of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time MOT framework that integrates Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for efficient and fault-tolerant video stream processing, along with state-of-the-art deep learning models YOLOv8/YOLOv10 and BYTETRACK/BoTSORT for accurate object detection and tracking. Our work highlights the importance of not only the advanced algorithms but also the integration of these methods with scalable and distributed systems. By leveraging these technologies, our system achieves a HOTA of 48.14 and a MOTA of 43.51 on the Visdrone2019-MOT test set while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 28 FPS on a single GPU. Our work demonstrates the potential of big data technologies and deep learning for addressing the challenges of MOT in UAV applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyin She, Ruifang Lu, Danni He, Jiayi Lv, Yadan Lin, Meiqing Cheng, Hui Huang, Lida Chen, Wei Wang, Qinghua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with early detection being crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, early screening for HCC using ultrasound suffers from insufficient sensitivity and is highly dependent on the expertise of radiologists for interpretation. Leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, this study proposes an innovative Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer (HSQformer) model that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance the accuracy of HCC diagnosis in ultrasound screening. The HSQformer leverages sparse latent space representations to capture hierarchical details at various granularities without the need for complex adjustments, and adopts a modular, plug-and-play design philosophy, ensuring the model's versatility and ease of use. The HSQformer's performance was rigorously tested across three distinct clinical scenarios: single-center, multi-center, and high-risk patient testing. In each of these settings, it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models, such as ConvNext and SwinTransformer. Notably, the HSQformer even matched the diagnostic capabilities of senior radiologists and comprehensively surpassed those of junior radiologists. The experimental results from this study strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of AI-assisted tools in HCC screening.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03777">Multi-Label Test-Time Adaptation with Bound Entropy Minimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Wu, Feng Yu, Qing-Guo Chen, Yang Yang, Jianfeng Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mainstream test-time adaptation (TTA) techniques endeavor to mitigate distribution shifts via entropy minimization for multi-class classification, inherently increasing the probability of the most confident class. However, when encountering multi-label instances, the primary challenge stems from the varying number of labels per image, and prioritizing only the highest probability class inevitably undermines the adaptation of other positive labels. To address this issue, we investigate TTA within multi-label scenario (ML--TTA), developing Bound Entropy Minimization (BEM) objective to simultaneously increase the confidence of multiple top predicted labels. Specifically, to determine the number of labels for each augmented view, we retrieve a paired caption with yielded textual labels for that view. These labels are allocated to both the view and caption, called weak label set and strong label set with the same size k. Following this, the proposed BEM considers the highest top-k predicted labels from view and caption as a single entity, respectively, learning both view and caption prompts concurrently. By binding top-k predicted labels, BEM overcomes the limitation of vanilla entropy minimization, which exclusively optimizes the most confident class. Across the MSCOCO, VOC, and NUSWIDE multi-label datasets, our ML--TTA framework equipped with BEM exhibits superior performance compared to the latest SOTA methods, across various model architectures, prompt initialization, and varying label scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyi Li, Yuting He, Rongjun Ge, Chong Wang, Daoqiang Zhang, Yang Chen, Shuo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) for cardiac ultrasound image segmentation is clinically significant and valuable. However, previous domain adaptation methods are prone to be affected by the incomplete pseudo-label and low-quality target to source images. Human-centric domain adaptation has great advantages of human cognitive guidance to help model adapt to target domain and reduce reliance on labels. Doctor gaze trajectories contains a large amount of cross-domain human guidance. To leverage gaze information and human cognition for guiding domain adaptation, we propose gaze-assisted human-centric domain adaptation (GAHCDA), which reliably guides the domain adaptation of cardiac ultrasound images. GAHCDA includes following modules: (1) Gaze Augment Alignment (GAA): GAA enables the model to obtain human cognition general features to recognize segmentation target in different domain of cardiac ultrasound images like humans. (2) Gaze Balance Loss (GBL): GBL fused gaze heatmap with outputs which makes the segmentation result structurally closer to the target domain. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed framework is able to segment cardiac ultrasound images more effectively in the target domain than GAN-based methods and other self-train based methods, showing great potential in clinical application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingshun Kong, Jiawei Zhang, Dongqing Zou, Jimmy Ren, Xiaohe Wu, Jiangxin Dong, Jinshan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved significant progress in image generation. The pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) models are helpful for image deblurring by providing clear image priors. However, directly using a blurry image or pre-deblurred one as a conditional control for SD will either hinder accurate structure extraction or make the results overly dependent on the deblurring network. In this work, we propose a Latent Kernel Prediction Network (LKPN) to achieve robust real-world image deblurring. Specifically, we co-train the LKPN in latent space with conditional diffusion. The LKPN learns a spatially variant kernel to guide the restoration of sharp images in the latent space. By applying element-wise adaptive convolution (EAC), the learned kernel is utilized to adaptively process the input feature, effectively preserving the structural information of the input. This process thereby more effectively guides the generative process of Stable Diffusion (SD), enhancing both the deblurring efficacy and the quality of detail reconstruction. Moreover, the results at each diffusion step are utilized to iteratively estimate the kernels in LKPN to better restore the sharp latent by EAC. This iterative refinement enhances the accuracy and robustness of the deblurring process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on both benchmark and real-world images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Li, Quanchao Lu, Yankaiqi Li, Muqing Li, Yijiashun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is one of the core tasks in the field of computer vision, and its goal is to accurately classify each pixel in an image. The traditional Unet model achieves efficient feature extraction and fusion through an encoder-decoder structure, but it still has certain limitations when dealing with complex backgrounds, long-distance dependencies, and multi-scale targets. To this end, this paper proposes an improved Unet model combined with an attention mechanism, introduces channel attention and spatial attention modules, enhances the model's ability to focus on important features, and optimizes skip connections through a multi-scale feature fusion strategy, thereby improving the combination of global semantic information and fine-grained features. The experiment is based on the Cityscapes dataset and compared with classic models such as FCN, SegNet, DeepLabv3+, and PSPNet. The improved model performs well in terms of mIoU and pixel accuracy (PA), reaching 76.5% and 95.3% respectively. The experimental results verify the superiority of this method in dealing with complex scenes and blurred target boundaries. In addition, this paper discusses the potential of the improved model in practical applications and future expansion directions, indicating that it has broad application value in fields such as autonomous driving, remote sensing image analysis, and medical image processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinya Sakurai, Issei Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Text-to-Image (T2I) models has revolutionized content creation, providing powerful tools for diverse applications ranging from artistic expression to educational material development and marketing. Despite these technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these models' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal biases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is included in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes in the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an LLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in generated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module that fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate identified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and datasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining high-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and quantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space, building upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our results show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the diversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate, using the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are challenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond occupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guohao Huo, Ruiting Dai, Ling Shao, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in visual understanding. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are predisposed to capture high-frequency features in images, while Transformers exhibit a contrasting focus on low-frequency features. In this paper, we experimentally quantify the contrast sensitivity function of CNNs and compare it with that of the human visual system, informed by the seminal experiments of Mannos and Sakrison. Leveraging these insights, we propose the Wavelet-Guided Spectral Pooling Module (WSPM) to enhance and balance image features across the frequency domain. To further emulate the human visual system, we introduce the Frequency Domain Enhanced Receptive Field Block (FE-RFB), which integrates WSPM to extract enriched features from the frequency domain. Building on these innovations, we develop FE-UNet, a model that utilizes SAM2 as its backbone and incorporates Hiera-Large as a pre-trained block, designed to enhance generalization capabilities while ensuring high segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that FE-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse tasks, including marine animal and polyp segmentation, underscoring its versatility and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenwei He, Hongsu Ni</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-domain generalization for object detection (S-DGOD) aims to transfer knowledge from a single source domain to unseen target domains. In recent years, many models have focused primarily on achieving feature invariance to enhance robustness. However, due to the inherent diversity across domains, an excessive emphasis on invariance can cause the model to overlook the actual differences between images. This overemphasis may complicate the training process and lead to a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose the Diversity Invariance Detection Model (DIDM), which focuses on the balance between the diversity of domain-specific and invariance cross domains. Recognizing that domain diversity introduces variations in domain-specific features, we introduce a Diversity Learning Module (DLM). The DLM is designed to preserve the diversity of domain-specific information with proposed feature diversity loss while limiting the category semantics in the features. In addition, to maintain domain invariance, we incorporate a Weighted Aligning Module (WAM), which aligns features without compromising feature diversity. We conducted our model on five distinct datasets, which have illustrated the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyang Xu, Buzhen Huang, Chengfang Zhang, Ziliang Feng, Yangang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human mesh recovery can be approached using either regression-based or optimization-based methods. Regression models achieve high pose accuracy but struggle with model-to-image alignment due to the lack of explicit 2D-3D correspondences. In contrast, optimization-based methods align 3D models to 2D observations but are prone to local minima and depth ambiguity. In this work, we leverage large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate interactive body part descriptions, which serve as implicit constraints to enhance 3D perception and limit the optimization space. Specifically, we formulate monocular human mesh recovery as a distribution adaptation task by integrating both 2D observations and language descriptions. To bridge the gap between text and 3D pose signals, we first train a text encoder and a pose VQ-VAE, aligning texts to body poses in a shared latent space using contrastive learning. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion-based framework to refine the initial parameters guided by gradients derived from both 2D observations and text descriptions. Finally, the model can produce poses with accurate 3D perception and image consistency. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbiao Ma, Wei Dai, Jiayi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In object detection, the instance count is typically used to define whether a dataset exhibits a long-tail distribution, implicitly assuming that models will underperform on categories with fewer instances. This assumption has led to extensive research on category bias in datasets with imbalanced instance counts. However, models still exhibit category bias even in datasets where instance counts are relatively balanced, clearly indicating that instance count alone cannot explain this phenomenon. In this work, we first introduce the concept and measurement of category information amount. We observe a significant negative correlation between category information amount and accuracy, suggesting that category information amount more accurately reflects the learning difficulty of a category. Based on this observation, we propose Information Amount-Guided Angular Margin (IGAM) Loss. The core idea of IGAM is to dynamically adjust the decision space of each category based on its information amount, thereby reducing category bias in long-tail datasets. IGAM Loss not only performs well on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as LVIS v1.0 and COCO-LT but also shows significant improvement for underrepresented categories in the non-long-tailed dataset Pascal VOC. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the potential of category information amount as a tool and the generality of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingjie Wu, Zitong Yu, Yiping Xie, Wei Liu, Chaoqi Luo, Yong Liu, Rick Siow Mong Goh</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a promising technique to monitor physiological signals such as heart rate from facial videos. However, the labeled facial videos in this research are challenging to collect. Current rPPG research is mainly based on several small public datasets collected in simple environments, which limits the generalization and scale of the AI models. Semi-supervised methods that leverage a small amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data can fill this gap for rPPG learning. In this study, a novel semi-supervised learning method named Semi-rPPG that combines curriculum pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization is proposed to extract intrinsic physiological features from unlabelled data without impairing the model from noises. Specifically, a curriculum pseudo-labeling strategy with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criteria is proposed to annotate the unlabelled data while adaptively filtering out the low-quality unlabelled data. Besides, a novel consistency regularization term for quasi-periodic signals is proposed through weak and strong augmented clips. To benefit the research on semi-supervised rPPG measurement, we establish a novel semi-supervised benchmark for rPPG learning through intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluation on four public datasets. The proposed Semi-rPPG method achieves the best results compared with three classical semi-supervised methods under different protocols. Ablation studies are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Li, Chuhan Zhang, Dong Zhang, Chong Sun, Chen Li, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's open vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Most existing methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: weakly supervised pre-training with image captions and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fully annotated scene graphs. Nonetheless, they omit explicit modeling of interacting objects and treat all objects equally, resulting in mismatched relation pairs. To this end, we propose an interaction-aware OVSGG framework INOVA. During pre-training, INOVA employs an interaction-aware target generation strategy to distinguish interacting objects from non-interacting ones. In SFT, INOVA devises an interaction-guided query selection tactic to prioritize interacting objects during bipartite graph matching. Besides, INOVA is equipped with an interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to enhance the robustness by pushing interacting object pairs away from the background. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks (VG and GQA) show that INOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-aware mechanisms for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of computer vision, 6D object detection and pose estimation are critical for applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. Traditional methods often struggle with achieving high accuracy in both object detection and precise pose estimation simultaneously. This study proposes an improved 6D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on the existing 6D-VNet framework, enhanced by integrating a Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) and a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) backbone. By leveraging the strengths of HTC's multi-stage refinement process and HRNet's ability to maintain high-resolution representations, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and pose estimation precision. Furthermore, we introduce advanced post-processing techniques and a novel model integration strategy that collectively contribute to superior performance on public and private benchmarks. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, making it a valuable contribution to the domain of 6D object detection and pose estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afnan Al-Ali, Uvais Qidwai</p>
<p>Abstract: Fuzzy rule-based systems interpret data in low-dimensional domains, providing transparency and interpretability. In contrast, deep learning excels in complex tasks like image and speech recognition but is prone to overfitting in sparse, unstructured, or low-dimensional data. This interpretability is crucial in fields like healthcare and finance. Traditional rule-based systems, especially ANFIS with grid partitioning, suffer from exponential rule growth as dimensionality increases. We propose a strategic rule-reduction model that applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on normalized firing strengths to obtain linearly uncorrelated components. Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) selectively refines these components, significantly reducing the number of rules while preserving precision in decision-making. A custom parameter update mechanism fine-tunes specific ANFIS layers by dynamically adjusting BPSO parameters, avoiding local minima. We validated our approach on standard UCI respiratory, keel classification, regression datasets, and a real-world ischemic stroke dataset, demonstrating adaptability and practicality. Results indicate fewer rules, shorter training, and high accuracy, underscoring the methods effectiveness for low-dimensional interpretability and complex data scenarios. This synergy of fuzzy logic and optimization fosters robust solutions. Our method contributes a powerful framework for interpretable AI in multiple domains. It addresses dimensionality, ensuring a rule base.</p>

Recently, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enable open-set semantic segmentation on camera images, potentially aiding automatic labeling. However,VFMs for 3D data have been limited to adaptations of 2D models, which can introduce inconsistencies to 3D labels. This work introduces Label Any Pointcloud (LeAP), leveraging 2D VFMs to automatically label 3D data with any set of classes in any kind of application whilst ensuring label consistency. Using a Bayesian update, point labels are combined into voxels to improve spatio-temporal consistency. A novel 3D Consistency Network (3D-CN) exploits 3D information to further improve label quality. Through various experiments, we show that our method can generate high-quality 3D semantic labels across diverse fields without any manual labeling. Further, models adapted to new domains using our labels show up to a 34.2 mIoU increase in semantic segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emil Mededovic, Valdy Laurentius, Yuli Wu, Marcin Kopaczka, Zhu Chen, Mareike Schulz, Ren\'e Tolba, Johannes Stegmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze the capabilities of foundation models addressing the tedious task of generating annotations for animal tracking. Annotating a large amount of data is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a tracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as accurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the behavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using foundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations is just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a thoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is a valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2 video with an IDF1 score of 65.6.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyank Pathak, Shyam Marjit, Shruti Vyas, Yogesh S Rawat</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual-language foundation Models (FMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization across diverse tasks, largely attributed to extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets. However, their robustness on low-resolution/pixelated (LR) images, a common challenge in real-world scenarios, remains underexplored. We introduce LR0.FM, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating the impact of low resolution on the zero-shot classification performance of 10 FM(s) across 66 backbones and 15 datasets. We propose a novel metric, Weighted Aggregated Robustness, to address the limitations of existing metrics and better evaluate model performance across resolutions and datasets. Our key findings show that: (i) model size positively correlates with robustness to resolution degradation, (ii) pre-training dataset quality is more important than its size, and (iii) fine-tuned and higher-resolution models are less robust against LR. Our analysis further reveals that the model makes semantically reasonable predictions at LR, and the lack of fine-grained details in input adversely impacts the model's initial layers more than the deeper layers. We use these insights and introduce a simple strategy, LR-TK0, to enhance the robustness of models without compromising their pre-trained weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LR-TK0 for robustness against low-resolution across several datasets and its generalization capability across backbones and other approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Tsigos, Evlampios Apostolidis, Vasileios Mezaris</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the idea of using adversarially-generated samples of the input images that were classified as deepfakes by a detector, to form perturbation masks for inferring the importance of different input features and produce visual explanations. We generate these samples based on Natural Evolution Strategies, aiming to flip the original deepfake detector's decision and classify these samples as real. We apply this idea to four perturbation-based explanation methods (LIME, SHAP, SOBOL and RISE) and evaluate the performance of the resulting modified methods using a SOTA deepfake detection model, a benchmarking dataset (FaceForensics++) and a corresponding explanation evaluation framework. Our quantitative assessments document the mostly positive contribution of the proposed perturbation approach in the performance of explanation methods. Our qualitative analysis shows the capacity of the modified explanation methods to demarcate the manipulated image regions more accurately, and thus to provide more useful explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Visual Language Modelsoften struggle with information loss and limited reasoning abilities when handling high-resolution web interfaces that combine complex visual, textual, and interactive elements. These challenges are particularly evident in tasks requiring webpage layout comprehension and multi-step interactive reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose RWKV-UI, a Visual Language Model based on the RWKV architecture, specifically designed to handle high-resolution UI images. During model training, we introduce layout detection as a visual prompt to help the model better understand the webpage layout structures. Additionally, we design a visual prompt based on the Chain-of-Thought(CoT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to understand and reason about webpage content through reasoning chains. Experimental results show that RWKV-UI demonstrates significant performance improvements in high-resolution UI understanding and interactive reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yuan, Shizhao Sun, Qi Liu, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer Aided Design (CAD) is indispensable across various industries. \emph{Text-based CAD editing}, which automates the modification of CAD models based on textual instructions, holds great potential but remains underexplored. Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bartosz Ptak, Marek Kraft</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate people localisation using drones is crucial for effective crowd management, not only during massive events and public gatherings but also for monitoring daily urban crowd flow. Traditional methods for tiny object localisation using high-resolution drone imagery often face limitations in precision and efficiency, primarily due to constraints in image scaling and sliding window techniques. To address these challenges, a novel approach dedicated to point-oriented object localisation is proposed. Along with this approach, the Pixel Distill module is introduced to enhance the processing of high-definition images by extracting spatial information from individual pixels at once. Additionally, a new dataset named UP-COUNT, tailored to contemporary drone applications, is shared. It addresses a wide range of challenges in drone imagery, such as simultaneous camera and object movement during the image acquisition process, pushing forward the capabilities of crowd management applications. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on the proposed dataset and the commonly used DroneCrowd dataset demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing methods and highlights its efficacy in drone-based crowd object localisation tasks. These improvements markedly increase the algorithm's applicability to operate in real-world scenarios, enabling more reliable localisation and counting of individuals in dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandar Cvejic (KAUST), Abdelrahman Eldesokey (KAUST), Peter Wonka (KAUST)</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the first text-based image editing approach for object parts based on pre-trained diffusion models. Diffusion-based image editing approaches capitalized on the deep understanding of diffusion models of image semantics to perform a variety of edits. However, existing diffusion models lack sufficient understanding of many object parts, hindering fine-grained edits requested by users. To address this, we propose to expand the knowledge of pre-trained diffusion models to allow them to understand various object parts, enabling them to perform fine-grained edits. We achieve this by learning special textual tokens that correspond to different object parts through an efficient token optimization process. These tokens are optimized to produce reliable localization masks at each inference step to localize the editing region. Leveraging these masks, we design feature-blending and adaptive thresholding strategies to execute the edits seamlessly. To evaluate our approach, we establish a benchmark and an evaluation protocol for part editing. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing editing methods on all metrics and is preferred by users 77-90% of the time in conducted user studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The management of natural environments, whether for conservation or production, requires a deep understanding of wildlife. The number, location, and behavior of wild animals are among the main subjects of study in ecology and wildlife research. The use of camera traps offers the opportunity to quickly collect large quantities of photographs that capture wildlife in its natural habitat, avoiding factors that could alter their behavior. In Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, research is being conducted on forest use by different herbivores (guanacos, cows, sheep) to optimize management and protect these natural ecosystems. Although camera traps allow for the collection of millions of images, interpreting such photographs presents a scalability challenge for manual processing. As a result, much of the valuable knowledge stored in these vast data repositories remains untapped. Neural Networks and Deep Learning are areas of study within Artificial Intelligence. Over the past decade, these two disciplines have made significant contributions to image recognition on a global scale. Ecological and wildlife conservation studies can be combined with these new technologies to extract important information from the photographs obtained by camera traps, contributing to the understanding of various natural processes and improving the management of the involved wild areas. Our project aims to develop neural network models to classify animal species in photographs taken with camera traps, addressing large-scale challenges in scientific research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04074">3D Prior is All You Need: Cross-Task Few-shot 2D Gaze Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihua Cheng, Hengfei Wang, Zhongqun Zhang, Yang Yue, Bo Eun Kim, Feng Lu, Hyung Jin Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D and 2D gaze estimation share the fundamental objective of capturing eye movements but are traditionally treated as two distinct research domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-task few-shot 2D gaze estimation approach, aiming to adapt a pre-trained 3D gaze estimation network for 2D gaze prediction on unseen devices using only a few training images. This task is highly challenging due to the domain gap between 3D and 2D gaze, unknown screen poses, and limited training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between 3D and 2D gaze. Our framework contains a physics-based differentiable projection module with learnable parameters to model screen poses and project 3D gaze into 2D gaze. The framework is fully differentiable and can integrate into existing 3D gaze networks without modifying their original architecture. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic pseudo-labelling strategy for flipped images, which is particularly challenging for 2D labels due to unknown screen poses. To overcome this, we reverse the projection process by converting 2D labels to 3D space, where flipping is performed. Notably, this 3D space is not aligned with the camera coordinate system, so we learn a dynamic transformation matrix to compensate for this misalignment. We evaluate our method on MPIIGaze, EVE, and GazeCapture datasets, collected respectively on laptops, desktop computers, and mobile devices. The superior performance highlights the effectiveness of our approach, and demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangkun Sun, Xiaoyu Liang, Bowen Qu, Wei Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of next-generation video generation models like \textit{Sora} poses challenges for AI-generated content (AIGC) video quality assessment (VQA). These models substantially mitigate flickering artifacts prevalent in prior models, enable longer and complex text prompts and generate longer videos with intricate, diverse motion patterns. Conventional VQA methods designed for simple text and basic motion patterns struggle to evaluate these content-rich videos. To this end, we propose \textbf{CRAVE} (\underline{C}ontent-\underline{R}ich \underline{A}IGC \underline{V}ideo \underline{E}valuator), specifically for the evaluation of Sora-era AIGC videos. CRAVE proposes the multi-granularity text-temporal fusion that aligns long-form complex textual semantics with video dynamics. Additionally, CRAVE leverages the hybrid motion-fidelity modeling to assess temporal artifacts. Furthermore, given the straightforward prompts and content in current AIGC VQA datasets, we introduce \textbf{CRAVE-DB}, a benchmark featuring content-rich videos from next-generation models paired with elaborate prompts. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed CRAVE achieves excellent results on multiple AIGC VQA benchmarks, demonstrating a high degree of alignment with human perception.

<p>Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become a standard clinical practice for tumor downsizing in breast cancer with 18F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Our work aims to leverage PET imaging for the segmentation of breast lesions. The focus is on developing an automated system that accurately segments primary tumor regions and extracts key biomarkers from these areas to provide insights into the evolution of breast cancer following the first course of NAC. 243 baseline 18F-FDG PET scans (PET_Bl) and 180 follow-up 18F-FDG PET scans (PET_Fu) were acquired before and after the first course of NAC, respectively. Firstly, a deep learning-based breast tumor segmentation method was developed. The optimal baseline model (model trained on baseline exams) was fine-tuned on 15 follow-up exams and adapted using active learning to segment tumor areas in PET_Fu. The pipeline computes biomarkers such as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) to evaluate tumor evolution between PET_Fu and PET_Bl. Quality control measures were employed to exclude aberrant outliers. The nnUNet deep learning model outperformed in tumor segmentation on PET_Bl, achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.89 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 3.52 mm. After fine-tuning, the model demonstrated a DSC of 0.78 and a HD of 4.95 mm on PET_Fu exams. Biomarkers analysis revealed very strong correlations whatever the biomarker between manually segmented and automatically predicted regions. The significant average decrease of SUVmax, MTV and TLG were 5.22, 11.79 cm3 and 19.23 cm3, respectively. The presented approach demonstrates an automated system for breast tumor segmentation from 18F-FDG PET. Thanks to the extracted biomarkers, our method enables the automatic assessment of cancer progression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aristeidis Panos, Rahaf Aljundi, Daniel Olmeda Reino, Richard E. Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Yueqi Duan, Runzhong Zhang, Yap-Peng Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, namely AMContrast3D. Most existing methods use equally penalized objectives, which ignore per-point ambiguities and less discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we design adaptive objectives for individual points based on their ambiguity levels, aiming to ensure the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes for high-ambiguity points. Specifically, we first estimate ambiguities based on position embeddings. Then, we develop a margin generator to shift decision boundaries for contrastive feature embeddings, so margins are narrowed due to increasing ambiguities with even negative margins for extremely high-ambiguity points. Experimental results on large-scale datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a scene and represent them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines, reduced manual selection of geometric properties, and superior performance. However, transformer-based methods fail to simultaneously maintain strong position and content information during query initialization. Additionally, due to supervision at each decoder layer, there exists a phenomenon of object disappearance with the deepening of layers. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation (BFL). Specifically, an Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module is designed to generate resilient queries capable of achieving a balance between foreground coverage and content learning. Additionally, a Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder is designed to retain low overlap queries, mitigating the decrease in recall with the deepening of layers. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++ and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BFL.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a validation dataset of newly-collected kitchen-based egocentric videos, manually annotated with highly detailed and interconnected ground-truth labels covering: recipe steps, fine-grained actions, ingredients with nutritional values, moving objects, and audio annotations. Importantly, all annotations are grounded in 3D through digital twinning of the scene, fixtures, object locations, and primed with gaze. Footage is collected from unscripted recordings in diverse home environments, making HDEPIC the first dataset collected in-the-wild but with detailed annotations matching those in controlled lab environments.
  We show the potential of our highly-detailed annotations through a challenging VQA benchmark of 26K questions assessing the capability to recognise recipes, ingredients, nutrition, fine-grained actions, 3D perception, object motion, and gaze direction. The powerful long-context Gemini Pro only achieves 38.5% on this benchmark, showcasing its difficulty and highlighting shortcomings in current VLMs. We additionally assess action recognition, sound recognition, and long-term video-object segmentation on HD-EPIC.
  HD-EPIC is 41 hours of video in 9 kitchens with digital twins of 413 kitchen fixtures, capturing 69 recipes, 59K fine-grained actions, 51K audio events, 20K object movements and 37K object masks lifted to 3D. On average, we have 263 annotations per minute of our unscripted videos.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04192">PixFoundation: Are We Heading in the Right Direction with Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mennatullah Siam</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. Such approaches have shown strong performance on benchmarks for referring expression segmentation and grounded conversation generation. The current trend in pixel-level MLLMs is to train with pixel-level grounding supervision on large-scale labelled data. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering. Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks and show that MLLMs without pixel-level grounding supervision can outperform the state of the art in such tasks when evaluating both the pixel-level grounding and visual question answering. We propose simple baselines to extract the grounding information that can be plugged into any MLLM, which we call as PixFoundation. More importantly, we study the research question of ``When does grounding emerge in MLLMs that are not trained with pixel-level grounding supervision?'' We show that grounding can coincide with object parts or location/appearance information. Code repository is at https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juming Xiong, Muyang Li, Ruining Deng, Tianyuan Yao, Regina N Tyree, Girish Hiremath, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Video endoscopy represents a major advance in the investigation of gastrointestinal diseases. Reviewing endoscopy videos often involves frequent adjustments and reorientations to piece together a complete view, which can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Image stitching techniques address this issue by providing a continuous and complete visualization of the examined area. However, endoscopic images, particularly those of the esophagus, present unique challenges. The smooth surface, lack of distinct feature points, and non-horizontal orientation complicate the stitching process, rendering traditional feature-based methods often ineffective for these types of images. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance endoscopic image stitching through advanced computational techniques. Our approach converts endoscopic video data into continuous 2D images by following four key steps: (1) keyframe selection, (2) image rotation adjustment to correct distortions, (3) surface unwrapping using polar coordinate transformation to generate a flat image, and (4) feature point matching enhanced by Adaptive Histogram Equalization for improved feature detection. We evaluate stitching quality through the assessment of valid feature point match pairs. Experiments conducted on 20 pediatric endoscopy videos demonstrate that our method significantly improves image alignment and stitching quality compared to traditional techniques, laying a robust foundation for more effective panoramic image creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilia Karmanov, Amala Sanjay Deshmukh, Lukas Voegtle, Philipp Fischer, Kateryna Chumachenko, Timo Roman, Jarno Sepp\"anen, Jupinder Parmar, Joseph Jennings, Andrew Tao, Karan Sapra</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is widely used to extract text from images of documents, facilitating efficient digitization and data retrieval. However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicen Li, Haitz S\'aez de Oc\'ariz Borde, Anastasis Kratsios, Paul D. McNicholas</p>
<p>Abstract: Many competitive clustering pipelines have a multi-modal design, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or other text encoders, and text-image pairs, which are often unavailable in real-world downstream applications. Additionally, such frameworks are generally complicated to train and require substantial computational resources, making widespread adoption challenging. In this work, we show that in deep clustering, competitive performance with more complex state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using a text-free and highly simplified training pipeline. In particular, our approach, Simple Clustering via Pre-trained models (SCP), trains only a small cluster head while leveraging pre-trained vision model feature representations and positive data pairs. Experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100, STL-10, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs, demonstrate that SCP achieves highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result explaining why, at least under ideal conditions, additional text-based embeddings may not be necessary to achieve strong clustering performance in vision.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the application domain of fleet management and driver monitoring, it is very challenging to obtain relevant driving events and activities from dashcam footage while minimizing the amount of information stored and analyzed. In this paper, we address the identification of overtake and lane change maneuvers with a novel object detection approach applied to motion profiles, a compact representation of driving video footage into a single image. To train and test our model we created an internal dataset of motion profile images obtained from a heterogeneous set of dashcam videos, manually labeled with overtake and lane change maneuvers by the ego-vehicle. In addition to a standard object-detection approach, we show how the inclusion of CoordConvolution layers further improves the model performance, in terms of mAP and F1 score, yielding state-of-the art performance when compared to other baselines from the literature. The extremely low computational requirements of the proposed solution make it especially suitable to run in device.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Mistretta, Alberto Baldrati, Lorenzo Agnolucci, Marco Bertini, Andrew D. Bagdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained multi-modal Vision-Language Models like CLIP are widely used off-the-shelf for a variety of applications. In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Yu, Botao Ren, Peiyuan Zhang, Mingxin Liu, Junwei Luo, Shaofeng Zhang, Feipeng Da, Junchi Yan, Xue Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning OOD from point annotations has gained great attention. In this paper, we rethink this challenging task setting with the layout among instances and present Point2RBox-v2. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. It learns an upper bound for each instance by treating objects as 2D Gaussian distributions and minimizing their overlap. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. It learns a lower bound for each instance through watershed on Voronoi tessellation. 3) Consistency loss. It learns the size/rotation variation between two output sets with respect to an input image and its augmented view. Supplemented by a few devised techniques, e.g. edge loss and copy-paste, the detector is further enhanced.To our best knowledge, Point2RBox-v2 is the first approach to explore the spatial layout among instances for learning point-supervised OOD. Our solution is elegant and lightweight, yet it is expected to give a competitive performance especially in densely packed scenes: 62.61%/86.15%/34.71% on DOTA/HRSC/FAIR1M.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihang Li, Hongli Xu, Junwen Huang, Hyunjun Jung, Peter KT Yu, Nassir Navab, Benjamin Busam</p>
<p>Abstract: A key challenge in model-free category-level pose estimation is the extraction of contextual object features that generalize across varying instances within a specific category. Recent approaches leverage foundational features to capture semantic and geometry cues from data. However, these approaches fail under partial visibility. We overcome this with a first-complete-then-aggregate strategy for feature extraction utilizing class priors. In this paper, we present GCE-Pose, a method that enhances pose estimation for novel instances by integrating category-level global context prior. GCE-Pose performs semantic shape reconstruction with a proposed Semantic Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module. Given an unseen partial RGB-D object instance, our SSR module reconstructs the instance's global geometry and semantics by deforming category-specific 3D semantic prototypes through a learned deep Linear Shape Model. We further introduce a Global Context Enhanced (GCE) feature fusion module that effectively fuses features from partial RGB-D observations and the reconstructed global context. Extensive experiments validate the impact of our global context prior and the effectiveness of the GCE fusion module, demonstrating that GCE-Pose significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging real-world datasets HouseCat6D and NOCS-REAL275.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinbo Xing, Long Mai, Cusuh Ham, Jiahui Huang, Aniruddha Mahapatra, Chi-Wing Fu, Tien-Tsin Wong, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method that allows users to design cinematic video shots in the context of image-to-video generation. Shot design, a critical aspect of filmmaking, involves meticulously planning both camera movements and object motions in a scene. However, enabling intuitive shot design in modern image-to-video generation systems presents two main challenges: first, effectively capturing user intentions on the motion design, where both camera movements and scene-space object motions must be specified jointly; and second, representing motion information that can be effectively utilized by a video diffusion model to synthesize the image animations. To address these challenges, we introduce MotionCanvas, a method that integrates user-driven controls into image-to-video (I2V) generation models, allowing users to control both object and camera motions in a scene-aware manner. By connecting insights from classical computer graphics and contemporary video generation techniques, we demonstrate the ability to achieve 3D-aware motion control in I2V synthesis without requiring costly 3D-related training data. MotionCanvas enables users to intuitively depict scene-space motion intentions, and translates them into spatiotemporal motion-conditioning signals for video diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of real-world image content and shot-design scenarios, highlighting its potential to enhance the creative workflows in digital content creation and adapt to various image and video editing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Choy, Alexey Kamenev, Jean Kossaifi, Max Rietmann, Jan Kautz, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is crucial for automotive design, requiring the analysis of large 3D point clouds to study how vehicle geometry affects pressure fields and drag forces. However, existing deep learning approaches for CFD struggle with the computational complexity of processing high-resolution 3D data. We propose Factorized Implicit Global Convolution (FIGConv), a novel architecture that efficiently solves CFD problems for very large 3D meshes with arbitrary input and output geometries. FIGConv achieves quadratic complexity $O(N^2)$, a significant improvement over existing 3D neural CFD models that require cubic complexity $O(N^3)$. Our approach combines Factorized Implicit Grids to approximate high-resolution domains, efficient global convolutions through 2D reparameterization, and a U-shaped architecture for effective information gathering and integration. We validate our approach on the industry-standard Ahmed body dataset and the large-scale DrivAerNet dataset. In DrivAerNet, our model achieves an $R^2$ value of 0.95 for drag prediction, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin. This represents a 40% improvement in relative mean squared error and a 70% improvement in absolute mean squared error over previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyvaz Najafli, Marius K\"astingsch\"afer, Sebastian Bernhard, Thomas Brox, Andreas Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing unbounded outdoor scenes from sparse outward-facing views poses significant challenges due to minimal view overlap. Previous methods often lack cross-scene understanding and their primitive-centric formulations overload local features to compensate for missing global context, resulting in blurriness in unseen parts of the scene. We propose sshELF, a fast, single-shot pipeline for sparse-view 3D scene reconstruction via hierarchal extrapolation of latent features. Our key insights is that disentangling information extrapolation from primitive decoding allows efficient transfer of structural patterns across training scenes. Our method: (1) learns cross-scene priors to generate intermediate virtual views to extrapolate to unobserved regions, (2) offers a two-stage network design separating virtual view generation from 3D primitive decoding for efficient training and modular model design, and (3) integrates a pre-trained foundation model for joint inference of latent features and texture, improving scene understanding and generalization. sshELF can reconstruct 360 degree scenes from six sparse input views and achieves competitive results on synthetic and real-world datasets. We find that sshELF faithfully reconstructs occluded regions, supports real-time rendering, and provides rich latent features for downstream applications. The code will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Do the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention mechanisms. Remarkably, ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 11 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset and on a single-class subset of PascalVOC. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiT models like Flux are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation, even outperforming multi-modal foundation models like CLIP.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce WorldSense, the first benchmark to assess the multi-modal video understanding, that simultaneously encompasses visual, audio, and text inputs. In contrast to existing benchmarks, our WorldSense has several features: (i) collaboration of omni-modality, we design the evaluation tasks to feature a strong coupling of audio and video, requiring models to effectively utilize the synergistic perception of omni-modality; (ii) diversity of videos and tasks, WorldSense encompasses a diverse collection of 1,662 audio-visual synchronised videos, systematically categorized into 8 primary domains and 67 fine-grained subcategories to cover the broad scenarios, and 3,172 multi-choice QA pairs across 26 distinct tasks to enable the comprehensive evaluation; (iii) high-quality annotations, all the QA pairs are manually labeled by 80 expert annotators with multiple rounds of correction to ensure quality. Based on our WorldSense, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results indicate that existing models face significant challenges in understanding real-world scenarios (48.0% best accuracy). We hope our WorldSense can provide a platform for evaluating the ability in constructing and understanding coherent contexts from omni-modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuyan Liu, Yuhao Dong, Jiahui Wang, Ziwei Liu, Winston Hu, Jiwen Lu, Yongming Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field.

<p>Abstract: Topology reasoning is crucial for autonomous driving as it enables comprehensive understanding of connectivity and relationships between lanes and traffic elements. While recent approaches have shown success in perceiving driving topology using vehicle-mounted sensors, their scalability is hindered by the reliance on training data captured by consistent sensor configurations. We identify that the key factor in scalable lane perception and topology reasoning is the elimination of this sensor-dependent feature. To address this, we propose SMART, a scalable solution that leverages easily available standard-definition (SD) and satellite maps to learn a map prior model, supervised by large-scale geo-referenced high-definition (HD) maps independent of sensor settings. Attributed to scaled training, SMART alone achieves superior offline lane topology understanding using only SD and satellite inputs. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that SMART can be seamlessly integrated into any online topology reasoning methods, yielding significant improvements of up to 28% on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the growing interest in human-AI decision making, experimental studies with domain experts remain rare, largely due to the complexity of working with domain experts and the challenges in setting up realistic experiments. In this work, we conduct an in-depth collaboration with radiologists in prostate cancer diagnosis based on MRI images. Building on existing tools for teaching prostate cancer diagnosis, we develop an interface and conduct two experiments to study how AI assistance and performance feedback shape the decision making of domain experts. In Study 1, clinicians were asked to provide an initial diagnosis (human), then view the AI's prediction, and subsequently finalize their decision (human-AI team). In Study 2 (after a memory wash-out period), the same participants first received aggregated performance statistics from Study 1, specifically their own performance, the AI's performance, and their human-AI team performance, and then directly viewed the AI's prediction before making their diagnosis (i.e., no independent initial diagnosis). These two workflows represent realistic ways that clinical AI tools might be used in practice, where the second study simulates a scenario where doctors can adjust their reliance and trust on AI based on prior performance feedback. Our findings show that, while human-AI teams consistently outperform humans alone, they still underperform the AI due to under-reliance, similar to prior studies with crowdworkers. Providing clinicians with performance feedback did not significantly improve the performance of human-AI teams, although showing AI decisions in advance nudges people to follow AI more. Meanwhile, we observe that the ensemble of human-AI teams can outperform AI alone, suggesting promising directions for human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Lu, Deqiang Xiao, Danni Ai, Jingfan Fan, Tianyu Fu, Yucong Lin, Hong Song, Xujiong Ye, Lei Zhang, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular endoscopic images presents significant challenges due to the complexity of endoscopic surgery, such as irregular shapes of human soft tissues, as well as variations in lighting conditions. Existing methods primarily estimate the depth information from RGB images directly, and often surffer the limited interpretability and accuracy. Given that RGB and depth images are two views of the same endoscopic surgery scene, in this paper, we introduce a novel concept referred as ``meta feature embedding (MetaFE)", in which the physical entities (e.g., tissues and surgical instruments) of endoscopic surgery are represented using the shared features that can be alternatively decoded into RGB or depth image. With this concept, we propose a two-stage self-supervised learning paradigm for the monocular endoscopic depth estimation. In the first stage, we propose a temporal representation learner using diffusion models, which are aligned with the spatial information through the cross normalization to construct the MetaFE. In the second stage, self-supervised monocular depth estimation with the brightness calibration is applied to decode the meta features into the depth image. Extensive evaluation on diverse endoscopic datasets demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in depth estimation, achieving superior accuracy and generalization. The source code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Indrashis Das, Mahmoud Safari, Steven Adriaensen, Frank Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental elements of deep learning architectures as they significantly influence training dynamics. ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p>

Dynamic sparse training, while attempting to adjust sparse structures during training for continual reassessment and refinement, has several limitations including criterion inconsistency between pruning and growth, unsuitability for structured sparsity, and short-sighted growth strategies. Our paper introduces an efficient, innovative paradigm to enhance a given importance criterion for either unstructured or structured sparsity. Our method separates the model into an active structure for exploitation and an exploration space for potential updates. During exploitation, we optimize the active structure, whereas in exploration, we reevaluate and reintegrate parameters from the exploration space through a pruning and growing step consistently guided by the same given importance criterion. To prepare for exploration, we briefly "reactivate" all parameters in the exploration space and train them for a few iterations while keeping the active part frozen, offering a preview of the potential performance gains from reintegrating these parameters. We show on various datasets and configurations that existing importance criterion even simple as magnitude can be enhanced with ours to achieve state-of-the-art performance and training cost reductions. Notably, on ImageNet with ResNet50, ours achieves an +1.3 increase in Top-1 accuracy over prior art at 90% ERK sparsity. Compared with the SOTA latency pruning method HALP, we reduced its training cost by over 70% while attaining a faster and more accurate pruned model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushagra Pandey, Farrin Marouf Sofian, Felix Draxler, Theofanis Karaletsos, Stephan Mandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit excellent sample quality, but existing guidance methods often require additional model training or are limited to specific tasks. We revisit guidance in diffusion models from the perspective of variational inference and control, introducing Diffusion Trajectory Matching (DTM) that enables guiding pretrained diffusion trajectories to satisfy a terminal cost. DTM unifies a broad class of guidance methods and enables novel instantiations. We introduce a new method within this framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several linear and (blind) non-linear inverse problems without requiring additional model training or modifications. For instance, in ImageNet non-linear deblurring, our model achieves an FID score of 34.31, significantly improving over the best pretrained-method baseline (FID 78.07). We will make the code available in a future update.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luohong Wu, Nicola A. Cavalcanti, Matthias Seibold, Giuseppe Loggia, Lisa Reissner, Jonas Hein, Silvan Beeler, Arnd Vieh\"ofer, Stephan Wirth, Lilian Calvet, Philipp F\"urnstahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound-based bone surface segmentation is crucial in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. However, ultrasound images have limitations, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, and acoustic shadowing, which make interpretation difficult. Existing deep learning models for bone segmentation rely primarily on costly manual labeling by experts, limiting dataset size and model generalizability. Additionally, the complexity of ultrasound physics and acoustic shadow makes the images difficult for humans to interpret, leading to incomplete labels in anechoic regions and limiting model performance. To advance ultrasound bone segmentation and establish effective model benchmarks, larger and higher-quality datasets are needed.
  We propose a methodology for collecting ex-vivo ultrasound datasets with automatically generated bone labels, including anechoic regions. The proposed labels are derived by accurately superimposing tracked bone CT models onto the tracked ultrasound images. These initial labels are refined to account for ultrasound physics. A clinical evaluation is conducted by an expert physician specialized on orthopedic sonography to assess the quality of the generated bone labels. A neural network for bone segmentation is trained on the collected dataset and its predictions are compared to expert manual labels, evaluating accuracy, completeness, and F1-score.
  We collected the largest known dataset of 100k ultrasound images of human lower limbs with bone labels, called UltraBones100k. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirmed that the bone alignment after our method significantly improved the quality of bone labeling (p < 0.001). The model trained on UltraBones100k consistently outperforms manual labeling in all metrics, particularly in low-intensity regions (320% improvement in completeness at a distance threshold of 0.5 mm).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Li, Tianyu Zeng, Yujia Zheng, Chulong Zhang, Jingyu Lu, Haotian Huang, Chuangxin Chu, Fang-Fang Yin, Zhenyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation models, such as U-Net, rely on high-quality annotated datasets to achieve accurate predictions. However, the increasing use of generative models for synthetic data augmentation introduces potential risks, particularly in the absence of rigorous quality control. In this paper, we investigate the impact of synthetic MRI data on the robustness and segmentation accuracy of U-Net models for brain tumor segmentation. Specifically, we generate synthetic T1-contrast-enhanced (T1-Ce) MRI scans using a GAN-based model with a shared encoding-decoding framework and shortest-path regularization. To quantify the effect of synthetic data contamination, we train U-Net models on progressively "poisoned" datasets, where synthetic data proportions range from 16.67% to 83.33%. Experimental results on a real MRI validation set reveal a significant performance degradation as synthetic data increases, with Dice coefficients dropping from 0.8937 (33.33% synthetic) to 0.7474 (83.33% synthetic). Accuracy and sensitivity exhibit similar downward trends, demonstrating the detrimental effect of synthetic data on segmentation robustness. These findings underscore the importance of quality control in synthetic data integration and highlight the risks of unregulated synthetic augmentation in medical image analysis. Our study provides critical insights for the development of more reliable and trustworthy AI-driven medical imaging systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhao, Linfeng Feng, Dongxu Ge, Fangqiu Yi, Chi Zhang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As a natural multimodal content, audible video delivers an immersive sensory experience. Consequently, audio-video generation systems have substantial potential. However, existing diffusion-based studies mainly employ relatively independent modules for generating each modality, which lack exploration of shared-weight generative modules. This approach may under-use the intrinsic correlations between audio and visual modalities, potentially resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose UniForm, a unified diffusion transformer designed to enhance cross-modal consistency. By concatenating auditory and visual information, UniForm learns to generate audio and video simultaneously within a unified latent space, facilitating the creation of high-quality and well-aligned audio-visual pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in joint audio-video generation, audio-guided video generation, and video-guided audio generation tasks.

Gaipl, Christoph Bert, Rainer Fietkau, Manuel A. Schmidt, Florian Putz</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate differentiation of pseudoprogression (PsP) from True Progression (TP) following radiotherapy (RT) in glioblastoma (GBM) patients is crucial for optimal treatment planning. However, this task remains challenging due to the overlapping imaging characteristics of PsP and TP. This study therefore proposes a multimodal deep-learning approach utilizing complementary information from routine anatomical MR images, clinical parameters, and RT treatment planning information for improved predictive accuracy. The approach utilizes a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) to encode multi-sequence MR brain volumes to effectively capture both global and local context from the high dimensional input. The encoder is trained in a self-supervised upstream task on unlabeled glioma MRI datasets from the open BraTS2021, UPenn-GBM, and UCSF-PDGM datasets to generate compact, clinically relevant representations from FLAIR and T1 post-contrast sequences. These encoded MR inputs are then integrated with clinical data and RT treatment planning information through guided cross-modal attention, improving progression classification accuracy. This work was developed using two datasets from different centers: the Burdenko Glioblastoma Progression Dataset (n = 59) for training and validation, and the GlioCMV progression dataset from the University Hospital Erlangen (UKER) (n = 20) for testing. The proposed method achieved an AUC of 75.3%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art data-driven approaches. Importantly, the proposed approach relies on readily available anatomical MRI sequences, clinical data, and RT treatment planning information, enhancing its clinical feasibility. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of limited data availability for PsP and TP differentiation and could allow for improved clinical decision-making and optimized treatment plans for GBM patients.</p>

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art image reconstruction often relies on complex, highly parameterized deep architectures. We propose an alternative: a data-driven reconstruction method inspired by the classic Tikhonov regularization. Our approach iteratively refines intermediate reconstructions by solving a sequence of quadratic problems. These updates have two key components: (i) learned filters to extract salient image features, and (ii) an attention mechanism that locally adjusts the penalty of filter responses. Our method achieves performance on par with leading plug-and-play and learned regularizer approaches while offering interpretability, robustness, and convergent behavior. In effect, we bridge traditional regularization and deep learning with a principled reconstruction approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juming Xiong, Hou Xiong, Quan Liu, Ruining Deng, Regina N Tyree, Girish Hiremath, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic esophageal disorder marked by eosinophil-dominated inflammation. Diagnosing EoE usually involves endoscopic inspection of the esophageal mucosa and obtaining esophageal biopsies for histologic confirmation. Recent advances have seen AI-assisted endoscopic imaging, guided by the EREFS system, emerge as a potential alternative to reduce reliance on invasive histological assessments. Despite these advancements, significant challenges persist due to the limited availability of data for training AI models - a common issue even in the development of AI for more prevalent diseases. This study seeks to improve the performance of deep learning-based EoE phenotype classification by augmenting our training data with a diverse set of images from online platforms, public datasets, and electronic textbooks increasing our dataset from 435 to 7050 images. We utilized the Data-efficient Image Transformer for image classification and incorporated attention map visualizations to boost interpretability. The findings show that our expanded dataset and model enhancements improved diagnostic accuracy, robustness, and comprehensive analysis, enhancing patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancements in autonomous driving technology, coupled with the growing interest from automotive manufacturers and tech companies, suggest a rising adoption of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the near future. Despite some evidence of higher accident rates in AVs, these incidents tend to result in less severe injuries compared to traditional vehicles due to cooperative safety measures. However, the increased complexity of CAV systems exposes them to significant security vulnerabilities, potentially compromising their performance and communication integrity. This paper contributes by presenting a detailed analysis of existing security frameworks and protocols, focusing on intra- and inter-vehicle communications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these frameworks in addressing known vulnerabilities and propose a set of best practices for enhancing CAV communication security. The paper also provides a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors in CAV ecosystems and suggests future research directions for designing more robust security mechanisms. Our key contributions include the development of a new classification system for CAV security threats, the proposal of practical security protocols, and the introduction of use cases that demonstrate how these protocols can be integrated into real-world CAV applications. These insights are crucial for advancing secure CAV adoption and ensuring the safe integration of autonomous vehicles into intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Heterogeneous Masked Autoregression (HMA) for modeling action-video dynamics to generate high-quality data and evaluation in scaling robot learning. Building interactive video world models and policies for robotics is difficult due to the challenge of handling diverse settings while maintaining computational efficiency to run in real time. HMA uses heterogeneous pre-training from observations and action sequences across different robotic embodiments, domains, and tasks. HMA uses masked autoregression to generate quantized or soft tokens for video predictions. \ourshort achieves better visual fidelity and controllability than the previous robotic video generation models with 15 times faster speed in the real world. After post-training, this model can be used as a video simulator from low-level action inputs for evaluating policies and generating synthetic data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dvir Samuel, Barak Meiri, Haggai Maron, Yoad Tewel, Nir Darshan, Shai Avidan, Gal Chechik, Rami Ben-Ari</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion inversion is the problem of taking an image and a text prompt that describes it and finding a noise latent that would generate the exact same image. Most current deterministic inversion techniques operate by approximately solving an implicit equation and may converge slowly or yield poor reconstructed images. We formulate the problem by finding the roots of an implicit equation and devlop a method to solve it efficiently. Our solution is based on Newton-Raphson (NR), a well-known technique in numerical analysis. We show that a vanilla application of NR is computationally infeasible while naively transforming it to a computationally tractable alternative tends to converge to out-of-distribution solutions, resulting in poor reconstruction and editing. We therefore derive an efficient guided formulation that fastly converges and provides high-quality reconstructions and editing. We showcase our method on real image editing with three popular open-sourced diffusion models: Stable Diffusion, SDXL-Turbo, and Flux with different deterministic schedulers. Our solution, Guided Newton-Raphson Inversion, inverts an image within 0.4 sec (on an A100 GPU) for few-step models (SDXL-Turbo and Flux.1), opening the door for interactive image editing. We further show improved results in image interpolation and generation of rare objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Person re-identification via 3D skeletons is an important emerging research area that attracts increasing attention within the pattern recognition community. With distinctive advantages across various application scenarios, numerous 3D skeleton based person re-identification (SRID) methods with diverse skeleton modeling and learning paradigms have been proposed in recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of recent SRID advances. First of all, we define the SRID task and provide an overview of its origin and major advancements. Secondly, we formulate a systematic taxonomy that organizes existing methods into three categories based on different skeleton modeling ($i.e.,$ hand-crafted, sequence-based, graph-based). Then, we elaborate on the representative models along these three categories with an analysis of their merits and limitations. Meanwhile, we provide an in-depth review of mainstream supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised SRID learning paradigms and corresponding skeleton semantics learning tasks. A thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art SRID methods is further conducted over various types of benchmarks and protocols to compare their effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, we discuss the challenges of existing studies along with promising directions for future research, highlighting research impacts and potential applications of SRID.</p>

To mitigate collisions, we introduce a Dance-Trajectory Navigator that generates collision-free trajectories for multiple dancers, utilizing a distance-consistency loss to maintain optimal spacing. Furthermore, to reduce foot sliding, we present a footwork adaptor that adjusts trajectory displacement between frames, supported by a relative forward-kinematic loss to further reinforce the correlation between movements and trajectories.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have suggested that by taking visual prompts, GPT-4V can demonstrate significant proficiency in visual recognition tasks. Despite its impressive capabilities, the financial cost associated with GPT-4V's inference presents a substantial barrier to its wide use. To address this challenge, we propose a budget-friendly collage prompting task that collages multiple images into a single visual prompt and makes GPT-4V perform visual recognition on several images simultaneously, thereby reducing the cost. We collect a dataset of various collage prompts to assess its performance in GPT-4V's visual recognition. Our evaluations reveal several key findings: 1) Recognition accuracy varies with different positions in the collage. 2) Grouping images of the same category together leads to better visual recognition results. 3) Incorrect labels often come from adjacent images. These findings highlight the importance of image arrangement within collage prompt. To this end, we construct a benchmark called CollagePrompt, which offers a platform for designing collage prompt to achieve more cost-effective visual recognition with GPT-4V. A baseline method derived from genetic algorithms to optimize collage layouts is proposed and two metrics are introduced to measure the efficiency of the optimized collage prompt. Our benchmark enables researchers to better optimize collage prompts, thus making GPT-4V more cost-effective in visual recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Gao, Xin Liu, Bohao Xing, Zitong Yu, Bjorn W. Schuller, Heikki K\"alvi\"ainen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we focus on a special group of human body language -- the micro-gesture (MG), which differs from the range of ordinary illustrative gestures in that they are not intentional behaviors performed to convey information to others, but rather unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings. This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjie Si, Xuehui Wang, Xue Yang, Zhengqin Xu, Qingyun Li, Jifeng Dai, Yu Qiao, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting pre-trained foundation models for various downstream tasks has been prevalent in artificial intelligence. Due to the vast number of tasks and high costs, adjusting all parameters becomes unfeasible. To mitigate this, several fine-tuning techniques have been developed to update the pre-trained model weights in a more resource-efficient manner, such as through low-rank adjustments. Yet, almost all of these methods focus on linear weights, neglecting the intricacies of parameter spaces in higher dimensions like 4D. Alternatively, some methods can be adapted for high-dimensional parameter space by compressing changes in the original space into two dimensions and then employing low-rank matrix adaptations. However, these approaches destructs the structural integrity of the involved high-dimensional spaces. To tackle the diversity of dimensional spaces across different foundation models and provide a more precise representation of the changes within these spaces, this paper introduces a generalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, designed for various dimensional parameter space. Specifically, our method asserts that changes in each dimensional parameter space are based on a low-rank core space which maintains the consistent topological structure with the original space. It then models the changes through this core space alongside corresponding weights to reconstruct alterations in the original space. It effectively preserves the structural integrity of the change of original N-dimensional parameter space, meanwhile models it via low-rank tensor adaptation. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural language processing and multi-modal tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyi Lu, Hao Liang, Xiao Wang, Xinqiang Yan, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrahigh field (UHF) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a higher signal-to-noise ratio and, thereby, higher spatial resolution. However, UHF MRI introduces challenges such as transmit radiofrequency (RF) field (B1+) inhomogeneities, leading to uneven flip angles and image intensity anomalies. These issues can significantly degrade imaging quality and its medical applications. This study addresses B1+ field homogeneity through a novel deep learning-based strategy. Traditional methods like Magnitude Least Squares (MLS) optimization have been effective but are time-consuming and dependent on the patient's presence. Recent machine learning approaches, such as RF Shim Prediction by Iteratively Projected Ridge Regression and deep learning frameworks, have shown promise but face limitations like extensive training times and oversimplified architectures. We propose a two-step deep learning strategy. First, we obtain the desired reference RF shimming weights from multi-channel B1+ fields using random-initialized Adaptive Moment Estimation. Then, we employ Residual Networks (ResNets) to train a model that maps B1+ fields to target RF shimming outputs. Our approach does not rely on pre-calculated reference optimizations for the testing process and efficiently learns residual functions. Comparative studies with traditional MLS optimization demonstrate our method's advantages in terms of speed and accuracy. The proposed strategy achieves a faster and more efficient RF shimming design, significantly improving imaging quality at UHF. This advancement holds potential for broader applications in medical imaging and diagnostics.</p>

The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) feature spline-based convolutional layers and learnable activation functions, which can effectively capture nonlinear dependencies. In this paper, we design a KAN-Block based on KANs and innovatively apply it to low-light image enhancement. This method effectively alleviates the limitations of current methods constrained by linear network structures and lack of interpretability, further demonstrating the potential of KANs in low-level vision tasks. Given the poor perception of current low-light image enhancement methods and the stochastic nature of the inverse diffusion process, we further introduce frequency-domain perception for visually oriented enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method on benchmark datasets. The code will be available at: https://github.com/AXNing/KSID}{https://github.com/AXNing/KSID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Wu, Zhiqiang Yan, Zhengxue Wang, Xiang Li, Le Hui, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of vision-based 3D occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct 3D geometry and estimate its semantic classes from 2D color images, where the 2D-to-3D view transformation is an indispensable step. Most previous methods conduct forward projection, such as BEVPooling and VoxelPooling, both of which map the 2D image features into 3D grids. However, the current grid representing features within a certain height range usually introduces many confusing features that belong to other height ranges. To address this challenge, we present Deep Height Decoupling (DHD), a novel framework that incorporates explicit height prior to filter out the confusing features. Specifically, DHD first predicts height maps via explicit supervision. Based on the height distribution statistics, DHD designs Mask Guided Height Sampling (MGHS) to adaptively decouple the height map into multiple binary masks. MGHS projects the 2D image features into multiple subspaces, where each grid contains features within reasonable height ranges. Finally, a Synergistic Feature Aggregation (SFA) module is deployed to enhance the feature representation through channel and spatial affinities, enabling further occupancy refinement. On the popular Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance even with minimal input frames. Source code is released at https://github.com/yanzq95/DHD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Knights, Sebasti\'an Barbas Laina, Peyman Moghadam, Stefan Leutenegger</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes SOLVR, a unified pipeline for learning based LiDAR-Visual re-localisation which performs place recognition and 6-DoF registration across sensor modalities. We propose a strategy to align the input sensor modalities by leveraging stereo image streams to produce metric depth predictions with pose information, followed by fusing multiple scene views from a local window using a probabilistic occupancy framework to expand the limited field-of-view of the camera. Additionally, SOLVR adopts a flexible definition of what constitutes positive examples for different training losses, allowing us to simultaneously optimise place recognition and registration performance. Furthermore, we replace RANSAC with a registration function that weights a simple least-squares fitting with the estimated inlier likelihood of sparse keypoint correspondences, improving performance in scenarios with a low inlier ratio between the query and retrieved place. Our experiments on the KITTI and KITTI360 datasets show that SOLVR achieves state-of-the-art performance for LiDAR-Visual place recognition and registration, particularly improving registration accuracy over larger distances between the query and retrieved place.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Xuejiao Hu, Xueqian Jin, Jinghao Cao, Sidan Du, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Omnidirectional depth estimation has received much attention from researchers in recent years. However, challenges arise due to camera soiling and variations in camera layouts, affecting the robustness and flexibility of the algorithm. In this paper, we use the geometric constraints and redundant information of multiple 360-degree cameras to achieve robust and flexible multi-view omnidirectional depth estimation. We implement two algorithms, in which the two-stage algorithm obtains initial depth maps by pairwise stereo matching of multiple cameras and fuses the multiple depth maps to achieve the final depth estimation; the one-stage algorithm adopts spherical sweeping based on hypothetical depths to construct a uniform spherical matching cost of the multi-camera images and obtain the depth. Additionally, a generalized epipolar equirectangular projection is introduced to simplify the spherical epipolar constraints. To overcome panorama distortion, a spherical feature extractor is implemented. Furthermore, a synthetic 360-degree dataset consisting of 12K road scene panoramas and 3K ground truth depth maps is presented to train and evaluate 360-degree depth estimation algorithms. Our dataset takes soiled camera lenses and glare into consideration, which is more consistent with the real-world environment. Experiments show that our two algorithms achieve state-of-the-art performance, accurately predicting depth maps even when provided with soiled panorama inputs. The flexibility of the algorithms is experimentally validated in terms of camera layouts and numbers.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04417">SparseVLM: Visual Token Sparsification for Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhang, Chun-Kai Fan, Junpeng Ma, Wenzhao Zheng, Tao Huang, Kuan Cheng, Denis Gudovskiy, Tomoyuki Okuno, Yohei Nakata, Kurt Keutzer, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), visual tokens usually bear a significant amount of computational overhead despite sparsity of information in them when compared to text tokens. To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens using certain training data. Differently, we propose a text-guided training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM that eliminates the need of extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLM's linguistic reasoning, we select relevant text tokens to rate the significance of visual tokens using self-attention matrices and, then, prune visual tokens using the proposed strategy to maximize sparsity while retaining information. In particular, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that SparseVLM increases the efficiency of various VLMs in a number of image and video understanding tasks. For example, LLaVA when equipped with SparseVLM achieves 54% reduction in FLOPs, 37% decrease in CUDA latency while maintaining 97% of its original accuracy.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose GLOV, which enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as implicit optimizers for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance downstream vision tasks. GLOV prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to their fitness for the downstream vision task. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we explicitly guide the LLM's generation at each optimization step by adding an offset vector -- calculated from the embedding differences between previous positive and negative solutions -- to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation. This offset vector biases the LLM generation toward the type of language the downstream VLM prefers, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on two tasks: object recognition and the critical task of enhancing VLM safety. Our GLOV shows performance improvement by up to 15.0% and 57.5% for dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LlaVA) models for object recognition and reduces the attack success rate (ASR) on state-of-the-art VLMs by up to $60.7\%$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyu Zhang, Peiyan Gu, Xueyang Yu, Xuming He</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the generalized category discovery (GCD) problem, which aims to discover novel classes in unlabeled datasets by leveraging the knowledge of known classes. Previous works utilize the known class knowledge through shared representation spaces. Despite their progress, our analysis experiments show that novel classes can achieve impressive clustering results on the feature space of a known class pre-trained model, suggesting that existing methods may not fully utilize known class knowledge. To address it, we introduce a novel concept learning framework for GCD, named ConceptGCD, that categorizes concepts into two types: derivable and underivable from known class concepts, and adopts a stage-wise learning strategy to learn them separately. Specifically, our framework first extracts known class concepts by a known class pre-trained model and then produces derivable concepts from them by a generator layer with a covariance-augmented loss. Subsequently, we expand the generator layer to learn underivable concepts in a balanced manner ensured by a concept score normalization strategy and integrate a contrastive loss to preserve previously learned concepts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the previous state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Le, Jason Xie, William Liang, Hung-Ju Wang, Yue Yang, Yecheng Jason Ma, Kyle Vedder, Arjun Krishna, Dinesh Jayaraman, Eric Eaton</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive 3D simulated objects are crucial in AR/VR, animations, and robotics, driving immersive experiences and advanced automation. However, creating these articulated objects requires extensive human effort and expertise, limiting their broader applications. To overcome this challenge, we present Articulate-Anything, a system that automates the articulation of diverse, complex objects from many input modalities, including text, images, and videos. Articulate-Anything leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that can be compiled into an interactable digital twin for use in standard 3D simulators. Our system exploits existing 3D asset datasets via a mesh retrieval mechanism, along with an actor-critic system that iteratively proposes, evaluates, and refines solutions for articulating the objects, self-correcting errors to achieve a robust outcome. Qualitative evaluations demonstrate Articulate-Anything's capability to articulate complex and even ambiguous object affordances by leveraging rich grounded inputs. In extensive quantitative experiments on the standard PartNet-Mobility dataset, Articulate-Anything substantially outperforms prior work, increasing the success rate from 8.7-11.6% to 75% and setting a new bar for state-of-the-art performance. We further showcase the utility of our system by generating 3D assets from in-the-wild video inputs, which are then used to train robotic policies for fine-grained manipulation tasks in simulation that go beyond basic pick and place. These policies are then transferred to a real robotic system.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-speed video (HSV) segmentation is essential for analyzing dynamic physical processes in scientific and industrial applications, such as boiling heat transfer. Existing models like U-Net struggle with generalization and accurately segmenting complex bubble formations. We present VideoSAM, a specialized adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), fine-tuned on a diverse HSV dataset for phase detection.

In addition to introducing VideoSAM, we contribute an open-source HSV segmentation dataset designed for phase detection, enabling future research in this domain. Our findings underscore VideoSAM's potential to set new standards in robust and accurate HSV segmentation.

<p>Abstract: Video question-answering (QA) is a core task in video understanding. Evaluating the quality of video QA and video caption data quality for training video large language models (VideoLLMs) is an essential challenge. Although various methods have been proposed for assessing video caption quality, there remains a lack of dedicated evaluation methods for Video QA. To address this gap, we introduce EVQAScore, a reference-free method that leverages keyword extraction to assess both video caption and video QA data quality. Additionally, we incorporate frame sampling and rescaling techniques to enhance the efficiency and robustness of our evaluation, this enables our score to evaluate the quality of extremely long videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (32.8 for Kendall correlation and 42.3 for Spearman correlation, 4.7 and 5.9 higher than the previous method PAC-S++) on the VATEX-EVAL benchmark for video caption evaluation. Furthermore, by using EVQAScore for data selection, we achieved SOTA results with only 12.5\% of the original data volume, outperforming the previous SOTA method PAC-S and 100\% of data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation demands reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. We present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME operates in a six-stage process, dynamically selecting the tools and search depth to extract and evaluate textual and visual evidence. Unlike prior approaches that are text-only, lack explainability, or rely solely on parametric knowledge, DEFAME performs end-to-end verification, accounting for images in claims and evidence while generating structured, multimodal reports. Evaluation on the popular benchmarks VERITE, AVerITeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all previous methods, establishing itself as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking system for uni- and multimodal fact-checking. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark, CLAIMREVIEW24+, featuring claims after the knowledge cutoff of GPT4o to avoid data leakage. Here, DEFAME drastically outperforms the GPT Chain-of-Thought baseline, demonstrating temporal generalizability and the potential for real-time fact-checking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxence Boels, Yang Liu, Prokar Dasgupta, Alejandro Granados, Sebastien Ourselin</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing approaches excel at recognising current surgical phases, they provide limited foresight and intraoperative guidance into future procedural steps. Similarly, current anticipation methods are constrained to predicting short-term and singular events, neglecting the dense and sequential nature of surgical workflows. To address these needs and limitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a framework to combine phase recognition and anticipation, using a generative approach for surgical workflow guidance. This paper investigates two distinct decoding methods-single-pass (SP) and auto-regressive (AR)-to generate sequences of future surgical phases at minute intervals over long horizons of up to 60 minutes. We propose a novel embedding approach using prior knowledge to enhance the accuracy of phase anticipation. Additionally, our anticipative framework offers remaining time regression and proposes a regression-to-classification (R2C) method. SWAG's performance was evaluated on the Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21 datasets. Our single-pass model with prior knowledge embeddings (SP*) achieves 49.8% mean accuracy over 18-minute anticipation on AutoLaparo21, while the simple SP with R2C extension reaches 56.6% mean accuracy over the same horizon on Cholec80. Moreover, our approach outperforms existing methods on the phase remaining time regression task, achieving weighted mean absolute errors of 0.32 and 0.48 minutes for 2- and 3-minute horizons, respectively. SWAG demonstrates versatility across classification and regression tasks and creates a temporal continuity between surgical workflow recognition and anticipation. While further studies are required to understand the impact of generative-based anticipation intraoperatively, our method provides steps towards this direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing both visual and textual information. However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and textual representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Dong Jiang, Chih-Yung Chang, Diptendu Sinha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention. However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding human perception of visual complexity is crucial in visual cognition. Recently (Shen, et al. 2024) proposed an interpretable segmentation-based model that accurately predicted complexity across various datasets, supporting the idea that complexity can be explained simply. In this work, we investigate the failure of their model to capture structural, color and surprisal contributions to complexity. To this end, we propose Multi-Scale Sobel Gradient which measures spatial intensity variations, Multi-Scale Unique Color which quantifies colorfulness across multiple scales, and surprise scores generated using a Large Language Model. We test our features on existing benchmarks and a novel dataset containing surprising images from Visual Genome. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling complexity accurately is not as simple as previously thought, requiring additional perceptual and semantic factors to address dataset biases.

<p>Abstract: This study explores the challenges of integrating human visual cue-based dehazing into object detection, given the selective nature of human perception. While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then enhanced via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human motion generation and editing are key components of computer graphics and vision. However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, MotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding} to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Muravyev, Alexander Melekhin, Dmitry Yudin, Konstantin Yakovlev</p>
<p>Abstract: Mapping is one of the crucial tasks enabling autonomous navigation of a mobile robot. Conventional mapping methods output a dense geometric map representation, e.g. an occupancy grid, which is not trivial to keep consistent for prolonged runs covering large environments. Meanwhile, capturing the topological structure of the workspace enables fast path planning, is typically less prone to odometry error accumulation, and does not consume much memory. Following this idea, this paper introduces PRISM-TopoMap -- a topological mapping method that maintains a graph of locally aligned locations not relying on global metric coordinates. The proposed method involves original learnable multimodal place recognition paired with the scan matching pipeline for localization and loop closure in the graph of locations. The latter is updated online, and the robot is localized in a proper node at each time step. We conduct a broad experimental evaluation of the suggested approach in a range of photo-realistic environments and on a real robot, and compare it to state of the art. The results of the empirical evaluation confirm that PRISM-Topomap consistently outperforms competitors computationally-wise, achieves high mapping quality and performs well on a real robot.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocong Rao, Minlin Zeng, Xuejiao Zhao, Chunyan Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, as well as in the development stage of machine learning algorithms that operate on medical images. The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Gerd Fritsch, Cennet Oguz, Vitor Fortes Rey, Lala Ray, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is a long-standing problem in artificial intelligence with applications in a broad range of areas, including healthcare, sports and fitness, security, and more. The performance of HAR in real-world settings is strongly dependent on the type and quality of the input signal that can be acquired. Given an unobstructed, high-quality camera view of a scene, computer vision systems, in particular in conjunction with foundation models, can today fairly reliably distinguish complex activities. On the other hand, recognition using modalities such as wearable sensors (which are often more broadly available, e.g., in mobile phones and smartwatches) is a more difficult problem, as the signals often contain less information and labeled training data is more difficult to acquire. To alleviate the need for labeled data, we introduce our comprehensive Fitness Multimodal Activity Dataset (FiMAD) in this work, which can be used with the proposed pre-training method MuJo (Multimodal Joint Feature Space Learning) to enhance HAR performance across various modalities. FiMAD was created using YouTube fitness videos and contains parallel video, language, pose, and simulated IMU sensor data. MuJo utilizes this dataset to learn a joint feature space for these modalities. We show that classifiers pre-trained on FiMAD can increase the performance on real HAR datasets such as MM-Fit, MyoGym, MotionSense, and MHEALTH. For instance, on MM-Fit, we achieve a Macro F1-Score of up to 0.855 when fine-tuning on only 2% of the training data and 0.942 when utilizing the complete training set for classification tasks. We compare our approach with other self-supervised ones and show that, unlike them, ours consistently improves compared to the baseline network performance while also providing better data efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivana Kaji\'c, Olivia Wiles, Isabela Albuquerque, Matthias Bauer, Su Wang, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Aida Nematzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models are capable of producing high-quality images that often faithfully depict concepts described using natural language. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate a range of text-to-image models on numerical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty, and show that even the most advanced models have only rudimentary numerical skills. Specifically, their ability to correctly generate an exact number of objects in an image is limited to small numbers, it is highly dependent on the context the number term appears in, and it deteriorates quickly with each successive number. We also demonstrate that models have poor understanding of linguistic quantifiers (such as "a few" or "as many as"), the concept of zero, and struggle with more advanced concepts such as partial quantities and fractional representations. We bundle prompts, generated images and human annotations into GeckoNum, a novel benchmark for evaluation of numerical reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Faysse, Hugues Sibille, Tony Wu, Bilel Omrani, Gautier Viaud, C\'eline Hudelot, Pierre Colombo</p>
<p>Abstract: Documents are visually rich structures that convey information through text, but also figures, page layouts, tables, or even fonts. Since modern retrieval systems mainly rely on the textual information they extract from document pages to index documents -often through lengthy and brittle processes-, they struggle to exploit key visual cues efficiently. This limits their capabilities in many practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieval tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and practical settings. The inherent complexity and performance shortcomings of modern systems motivate a new concept; doing document retrieval by directly embedding the images of the document pages. We release ColPali, a Vision Language Model trained to produce high-quality multi-vector embeddings from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically simpler, faster and end-to-end trainable. We release models, data, code and benchmarks under open licenses at https://hf.co/vidore.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianpeng Yao, Xiaopan Zhang, Yu Xia, Zejin Wang, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, Jiachen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables social robots to generate trajectories without relying on human-designed rules or interventions, making it generally more effective than rule-based systems in adapting to complex, dynamic real-world scenarios. However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians, whereas existing RL-based solutions often fall short of ensuring safety in complex environments. In this paper, we propose SoNIC, which to the best of our knowledge is the first algorithm that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to enable safe policy learning for social navigation. Specifically, our method not only augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores, which inform the agent of the quantified uncertainty but also employs these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide the behaviors of RL agents by using constrained reinforcement learning. This integration regulates the behaviors of RL agents and enables them to handle safety-critical situations. On the standard CrowdNav benchmark, our method achieves a success rate of 96.93%, which is 11.67% higher than the previous state-of-the-art RL method and results in 4.5 times fewer collisions and 2.8 times fewer intrusions to ground-truth human future trajectories as well as enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. To further validate our approach, we deploy our algorithm on a real robot by developing a ROS2-based navigation system. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can generate robust and socially polite decision-making when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds.

<p>Abstract: Deep Generative Models are frequently used to learn continuous representations of complex data distributions using a finite number of samples. For any generative model, including pre-trained foundation models with Diffusion or Transformer architectures, generation performance can significantly vary across the learned data manifold. In this paper we study the local geometry of the learned manifold and its relationship to generation outcomes for a wide range of generative models, including DDPM, Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and Stable Diffusion 1.4. Building on the theory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we characterize the local geometry in terms of three geometric descriptors - scaling ($\psi$), rank ($\nu$), and complexity/un-smoothness ($\delta$). We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent-image pair, the local descriptors are indicative of generation aesthetics, diversity, and memorization by the generative model. Finally, we demonstrate that by training a reward model on the local scaling for Stable Diffusion, we can self-improve both generation aesthetics and diversity using `geometry reward' based guidance during denoising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pucheng Dang, Xing Hu, Dong Li, Rui Zhang, Qi Guo, Kaidi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) synthesis diffusion models raise misuse concerns, particularly in creating prohibited or not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. To address this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are proposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable content. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text encoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of \textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To overcome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks within a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order Optimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and D-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated our method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and online servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show that DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous works, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjie Si, Zhiyi Shi, Shifan Zhang, Xiaokang Yang, Hanspeter Pfister, Wei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet requiring extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs)-critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties, and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of LoRA-Dash, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms of LoRA-Dash.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Wu, Chenhe Du, Xuanyu Tian, Jingyi Yu, Yuyao Zhang, Hongjiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion correction (MoCo) in radial MRI is a challenging problem due to the unpredictability of subject's motion. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MoCo algorithms often use extensive high-quality MR images to pre-train neural networks, obtaining excellent reconstructions. However, the need for large-scale datasets significantly increases costs and limits model generalization. In this work, we propose Moner, an unsupervised MoCo method that jointly solves artifact-free MR images and accurate motion from undersampled, rigid motion-corrupted k-space data, without requiring training data. Our core idea is to leverage the continuous prior of implicit neural representation (INR) to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem, enabling ideal solutions. Specifically, we incorporate a quasi-static motion model into the INR, granting its ability to correct subject's motion. To stabilize model optimization, we reformulate radial MRI as a back-projection problem using the Fourier-slice theorem. Additionally, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine hash encoding strategy, significantly enhancing MoCo accuracy. Experiments on multiple MRI datasets show our Moner achieves performance comparable to SOTA MoCo techniques on in-domain data, while demonstrating significant improvements on out-of-domain data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Haocheng Yin, Heng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space -- the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder -- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of neural collapse (NC) in image classification (arXiv:2008.08186), we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar law of clustering in the visual representation space. Specifically, in discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels; in continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to "control-oriented" classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO).
  Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Vision and Language models (VLMs) are reaching users across the globe, assessing their cultural understanding has become a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce CROPE, a visual question answering benchmark designed to probe the knowledge of culture-specific concepts and evaluate the capacity for cultural adaptation through contextual information. This allows us to distinguish between parametric knowledge acquired during training and contextual knowledge provided during inference via visual and textual descriptions. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art open VLMs shows large performance disparities between culture-specific and common concepts in the parametric setting. Moreover, experiments with contextual knowledge indicate that models struggle to effectively utilize multimodal information and bind culture-specific concepts to their depictions. Our findings reveal limitations in the cultural understanding and adaptability of current VLMs that need to be addressed toward more culturally inclusive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Liu, Junxuan Liang, Zili Lin, Haowen Hou, Yong-Lu Li, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse dynamics (ID), which aims at reproducing the driven torques from human kinematic observations, has been a critical tool for gait analysis. However, it is hindered from wider application to general motion due to its limited scalability. Conventional optimization-based ID requires expensive laboratory setups, restricting its availability. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit the recently progressive human motion imitation algorithms to learn human inverse dynamics in a data-driven manner. The key insight is that the human ID knowledge is implicitly possessed by motion imitators, though not directly applicable. In light of this, we devise an efficient data collection pipeline with state-of-the-art motion imitation algorithms and physics simulators, resulting in a large-scale human inverse dynamics benchmark as Imitated Dynamics (ImDy). ImDy contains over 150 hours of motion with joint torque and full-body ground reaction force data. With ImDy, we train a data-driven human inverse dynamics solver ImDyS(olver) in a fully supervised manner, which conducts ID and ground reaction force estimation simultaneously. Experiments on ImDy and real-world data demonstrate the impressive competency of ImDyS in human inverse dynamics and ground reaction force estimation. Moreover, the potential of ImDy(-S) as a fundamental motion analysis tool is exhibited with downstream applications. The project page is https://foruck.github.io/ImDy/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yang, Shubham Ugare, Yifan Zhao, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed precision quantization has become an important technique for optimizing the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs). Certified robustness, which provides provable guarantees about a model's ability to withstand different adversarial perturbations, has rarely been addressed in quantization due to unacceptably high cost of certifying robustness. This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness. ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms. ARQ consistently performs better than multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. The performance of ARQ quantized networks reaches that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions and the highest certified radius.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhao Zhang, Kunyu Wang, Shaoan Wang, Minghan Li, Haoran Liu, Songlin Wei, Zhongyuan Wang, Zhizheng Zhang, He Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A practical navigation agent must be capable of handling a wide range of interaction demands, such as following instructions, searching objects, answering questions, tracking people, and more. Existing models for embodied navigation fall short of serving as practical generalists in the real world, as they are often constrained by specific task configurations or pre-defined maps with discretized waypoints. In this work, we present Uni-NaVid, the first video-based vision-language-action (VLA) model designed to unify diverse embodied navigation tasks and enable seamless navigation for mixed long-horizon tasks in unseen real-world environments. Uni-NaVid achieves this by harmonizing the input and output data configurations for all commonly used embodied navigation tasks and thereby integrating all tasks in one model. For training Uni-NaVid, we collect 3.6 million navigation data samples in total from four essential navigation sub-tasks and foster synergy in learning across them. Extensive experiments on comprehensive navigation benchmarks clearly demonstrate the advantages of unification modeling in Uni-NaVid and show it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, real-world experiments confirm the model's effectiveness and efficiency, shedding light on its strong generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gursimran Singh, Xinglu Wang, Yifan Hu, Timothy Yu, Linzi Xing, Wei Jiang, Zhefeng Wang, Xiaolong Bai, Yi Li, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively impacting key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like time to first token (TTFT) and end-to-end throughput (E2ETP). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouple these steps unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a new mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize encoding load within a request, a module to find the optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15$\times$ less utilization), batch sizes (up to 22$\times$ larger), 10$\times$ more images/request, and 2.2$\times$ larger KV caches. Further, it leads to significant improvements in latency metrics (TTFT up to 71\% reduction) and end-to-end throughput (up to 57\% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Ehsani, Fenglian Pan, Qingpei Hu, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of spatial-temporal (ST) information in dynamic systems, such as urban mobility and weather patterns, is a crucial yet challenging problem. The complexity stems from the intricate interplay between spatial proximity and temporal relevance, where both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations are present in convoluted patterns. Existing approaches, including traditional statistical methods and conventional neural networks, may provide inaccurate results due to the lack of an effective mechanism that simultaneously incorporates information at variable temporal depths while maintaining spatial context, resulting in a trade-off between comprehensive long-term historical analysis and responsiveness to short-term new information. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN) with bidirectional depth modulation that enables a comprehensive understanding of both long-term seasonality and short-term fluctuations, adapting to the complex ST context. Case studies with real-world public data demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy, with a 12% reduction in Mean Squared Error for urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in rain precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, without demanding extra computational resources.</p>

However, existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods take up huge memory footprints in large-scale optimization settings, as the learned optimizer can only adapt gradients of a fixed size and thus cannot be shared across different Riemannian parameters. In this paper, we propose an efficient Riemannian meta-optimization method that significantly reduces the memory burden for large-scale optimization via a subspace adaptation scheme. Our method trains neural networks to individually adapt the row and column subspaces of Riemannian gradients, instead of directly adapting the full gradient matrices in existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods. In this case, our learned optimizer can be shared across Riemannian parameters with different sizes. Our method reduces the model memory consumption by six orders of magnitude when optimizing an orthogonal mainstream deep neural network (e.g., ResNet50). Experiments on multiple Riemannian tasks show that our method can not only reduce the memory consumption but also improve the performance of Riemannian meta-optimization.</p>
