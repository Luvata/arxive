<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongling Huang, Xidan Zhang, Zuqian Tang, Feng Xu, Mihai Datcu, Junwei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: SAR images possess unique attributes that present challenges for both human observers and vision AI models to interpret, owing to their electromagnetic characteristics. The interpretation of SAR images encounters various hurdles, with one of the primary obstacles being the data itself, which includes issues related to both the quantity and quality of the data. The challenges can be addressed using generative AI technologies. Generative AI, often known as GenAI, is a very advanced and powerful technology in the field of artificial intelligence that has gained significant attention. The advancement has created possibilities for the creation of texts, photorealistic pictures, videos, and material in various modalities. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the intersection of GenAI and SAR. First, we illustrate the common data generation-based applications in SAR field and compare them with computer vision tasks, analyzing the similarity, difference, and general challenges of them. Then, an overview of the latest GenAI models is systematically reviewed, including various basic models and their variations targeting the general challenges. Additionally, the corresponding applications in SAR domain are also included. Specifically, we propose to summarize the physical model based simulation approaches for SAR, and analyze the hybrid modeling methods that combine the GenAI and interpretable models. The evaluation methods that have been or could be applied to SAR, are also explored. Finally, the potential challenges and future prospects are discussed. To our best knowledge, this survey is the first exhaustive examination of the interdiscipline of SAR and GenAI, encompassing a wide range of topics, including deep neural networks, physical models, computer vision, and SAR images.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05028">Leveraging Transfer Learning and Multiple Instance Learning for HER2 Automatic Scoring of H\&amp;E Whole Slide Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rawan S. Abdulsadig, Bryan M. Williams, Nikolay Burlutskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: Expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker in breast cancer patients who can benefit from cost-effective automatic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) HER2 scoring. However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</p>

<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people globally, with respiratory organs being strongly affected in individuals with comorbidities. Medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis have become increasingly popular in clinical settings for detecting COVID-19 lung infections. Among various medical imaging modalities, ultrasound stands out as a low-cost, mobile, and radiation-safe imaging technology. In this comprehensive review, we focus on AI-driven studies utilizing lung ultrasound (LUS) for COVID-19 detection and analysis. We provide a detailed overview of both publicly available and private LUS datasets and categorize the AI studies according to the dataset they used. Additionally, we systematically analyzed and tabulated the studies across various dimensions, including data preprocessing methods, AI models, cross-validation techniques, and evaluation metrics. In total, we reviewed 60 articles, 41 of which utilized public datasets, while the remaining employed private data. Our findings suggest that ultrasound-based AI studies for COVID-19 detection have great potential for clinical use, especially for children and pregnant women. Our review also provides a useful summary for future researchers and clinicians who may be interested in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Multi-language Video Subtitle Dataset is a comprehensive collection designed to support research in text recognition across multiple languages. This dataset includes 4,224 subtitle images extracted from 24 videos sourced from online platforms. It features a wide variety of characters, including Thai consonants, vowels, tone marks, punctuation marks, numerals, Roman characters, and Arabic numerals. With 157 unique characters, the dataset provides a resource for addressing challenges in text recognition within complex backgrounds. It addresses the growing need for high-quality, multilingual text recognition data, particularly as videos with embedded subtitles become increasingly dominant on platforms like YouTube and Facebook. The variability in text length, font, and placement within these images adds complexity, offering a valuable resource for developing and evaluating deep learning models. The dataset facilitates accurate text transcription from video content while providing a foundation for improving computational efficiency in text recognition systems. As a result, it holds significant potential to drive advancements in research and innovation across various computer science disciplines, including artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Cheng, Maitreya Patel, Yezhou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in text-to-image models, generating images that precisely align with textual descriptions remains challenging due to misalignment in training data. In this paper, we analyze the critical role of caption precision and recall in text-to-image model training. Our analysis of human-annotated captions shows that both precision and recall are important for text-image alignment, but precision has a more significant impact. Leveraging these insights, we utilize Large Vision Language Models to generate synthetic captions for training. Models trained with these synthetic captions show similar behavior to those trained on human-annotated captions, underscores the potential for synthetic data in text-to-image training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chapman, Parniyan Farvardin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel empirical approach toward measuring the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the deep features of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Measurement of the deep feature PDF is a valuable problem for several reasons. Notably, a. Understanding the deep feature PDF yields new insight into deep representations. b. Feature density methods are important for tasks such as anomaly detection which can improve the robustness of deep learning models in the wild. Interpretable measurement of the deep feature PDF is challenging due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD), and the Spatial intuition Limitation. Our novel measurement technique combines copula analysis with the Method of Orthogonal Moments (MOM), in order to directly measure the Generalized Characteristic Function (GCF) of the multivariate deep feature PDF. We find that, surprisingly, the one-dimensional marginals of non-negative deep CNN features after major blocks are not well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, and that these features increasingly approximate an exponential distribution with increasing network depth. Furthermore, we observe that deep features become increasingly independent with increasing network depth within their typical ranges. However, we surprisingly also observe that many deep features exhibit strong dependence (either correlation or anti-correlation) with other extremely strong detections, even if these features are independent within typical ranges. We elaborate on these findings in our discussion, where we propose a new hypothesis that exponentially infrequent large valued features correspond to strong computer vision detections of semantic targets, which would imply that these large-valued features are not outliers but rather an important detection signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Willmes, Nick Krall, James Tanis, Zachary Terner, Fernando Tavares, Joe Haberlin III, Matt Crichton, Alexander Schlichting</p>
<p>Abstract: With billions of people facing moderate or severe food insecurity, the resilience of the global food supply will be of increasing concern due to the effects of climate change and geopolitical events. In this paper we describe a framework to better identify food security hotspots using a combination of remote sensing, deep learning, crop yield modeling, and causal modeling of the food distribution system. While we feel that the methods are adaptable to other regions of the world, we focus our analysis on the wheat breadbasket of northern India, which supplies a large percentage of the world's population. We present a quantitative analysis of deep learning domain adaptation methods for wheat farm identification based on curated remote sensing data from France. We model climate change impacts on crop yields using the existing crop yield modeling tool WOFOST and we identify key drivers of crop simulation error using a longitudinal penalized functional regression. A description of a system dynamics model of the food distribution system in India is also presented, along with results of food insecurity identification based on seeding this model with the predicted crop yields.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05222">Don&#x27;t Look Twice: Faster Video Transformers with Run-Length Tokenization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohan Choudhury, Guanglei Zhu, Sihan Liu, Koichiro Niinuma, Kris M. Kitani, L\'aszl\'o Jeni</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers are slow to train on videos due to extremely large numbers of input tokens, even though many video tokens are repeated over time. Existing methods to remove such uninformative tokens either have significant overhead, negating any speedup, or require tuning for different datasets and examples. We present Run-Length Tokenization (RLT), a simple approach to speed up video transformers inspired by run-length encoding for data compression. RLT efficiently finds and removes runs of patches that are repeated over time prior to model inference, then replaces them with a single patch and a positional encoding to represent the resulting token's new length. Our method is content-aware, requiring no tuning for different datasets, and fast, incurring negligible overhead. RLT yields a large speedup in training, reducing the wall-clock time to fine-tune a video transformer by 30% while matching baseline model performance. RLT also works without any training, increasing model throughput by 35% with only 0.1% drop in accuracy. RLT speeds up training at 30 FPS by more than 100%, and on longer video datasets, can reduce the token count by up to 80%. Our project page is at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/projects/rlt/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boqi Chen, Yuanzhi Zhu, Yunke Ao, Sebastiano Caprara, Reto Sutter, Gunnar R\"atsch, Ender Konukoglu, Anna Susmelj</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-source domain generalization (SDG) aims to learn a model from a single source domain that can generalize well on unseen target domains. This is an important task in computer vision, particularly relevant to medical imaging where domain shifts are common. In this work, we consider a challenging yet practical setting: SDG for cross-modality medical image segmentation. We combine causality-inspired theoretical insights on learning domain-invariant representations with recent advancements in diffusion-based augmentation to improve generalization across diverse imaging modalities. Guided by the ``intervention-augmentation equivariant'' principle, we use controlled diffusion models (DMs) to simulate diverse imaging styles while preserving the content, leveraging rich generative priors in large-scale pretrained DMs to comprehensively perturb the multidimensional style variable. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SDG methods across three distinct anatomies and imaging modalities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corwin Grant Jeon MacMillan, K. Andrea Scott, Zhao Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid ice recession in the Arctic Ocean, with predictions of ice-free summers by 2060, opens new maritime routes but requires reliable navigation solutions. Current approaches rely heavily on subjective expert judgment, underscoring the need for automated, data-driven solutions. This study leverages machine learning to assess ice conditions using ship-borne optical data, introducing a finely annotated dataset of 946 images, and a semi-manual, region-based annotation technique. The proposed video segmentation model, UPerFlow, advances the SegFlow architecture by incorporating a six-channel ResNet encoder, two UPerNet-based segmentation decoders for each image, PWCNet as the optical flow encoder, and cross-connections that integrate bi-directional flow features without loss of latent information. The proposed architecture outperforms baseline image segmentation networks by an average 38\% in occluded regions, demonstrating the robustness of video segmentation in addressing challenging Arctic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyoo Park, Jin Young Choi, Jeonghyung Park, Bohyung Han</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel OCR-free document understanding framework based on pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach employs multi-scale visual features to effectively handle various font sizes within document images. To address the increasing costs of considering the multi-scale visual inputs for MLLMs, we propose the Hierarchical Visual Feature Aggregation (HVFA) module, designed to reduce the number of input tokens to LLMs. Leveraging a feature pyramid with cross-attentive pooling, our approach effectively manages the trade-off between information loss and efficiency without being affected by varying document image sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel instruction tuning task, which facilitates the model's text-reading capability by learning to predict the relative positions of input text, eventually minimizing the risk of truncated text caused by the limited capacity of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance in various document understanding tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in report generation methods, a critical limitation remains: the lack of interpretability in the generated text. This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance the explainability of text generated by report generation models. Our method employs cyclic text manipulation and visual comparison to identify and elucidate the features in the original content that influence the generated text. By manipulating the generated reports and producing corresponding images, we create a comparative framework that highlights key attributes and their impact on the text generation process. This approach not only identifies the image features aligned to the generated text but also improves transparency but also provides deeper insights into the decision-making mechanisms of the report generation models. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this method to significantly enhance the interpretability and transparency of AI-generated reports.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the United States, skin cancer ranks as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, presenting a significant public health issue due to its high rates of occurrence and the risk of serious complications if not caught early. Recent advancements in dataset curation and deep learning have shown promise in quick and accurate detection of skin cancer. However, current open-source datasets have significant class imbalances which impedes the effectiveness of these deep learning models. In healthcare, generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have been employed to create synthetic data, addressing data imbalance in datasets by augmenting underrepresented classes and enhancing the overall quality and performance of machine learning models. In this paper, we build on top of previous work by leveraging new advancements in generative AI, notably Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth. We introduce Cancer-Net SCa-Synth, an open access synthetically generated 2D skin lesion dataset for skin cancer classification. Further analysis on the data effectiveness by comparing the ISIC 2020 test set performance for training with and without these synthetic images for a simple model highlights the benefits of leveraging synthetic data to improve performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Zhao, Zhan Gong, Peiru Zheng, Hong Zhu, Shaohua Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: More and more research works fuse the LiDAR and camera information to improve the 3D object detection of the autonomous driving system. Recently, a simple yet effective fusion framework has achieved an excellent detection performance, fusing the LiDAR and camera features in a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV) space. In this paper, we propose a LiDAR-camera fusion framework, named SimpleBEV, for accurate 3D object detection, which follows the BEV-based fusion framework and improves the camera and LiDAR encoders, respectively. Specifically, we perform the camera-based depth estimation using a cascade network and rectify the depth results with the depth information derived from the LiDAR points. Meanwhile, an auxiliary branch that implements the 3D object detection using only the camera-BEV features is introduced to exploit the camera information during the training phase. Besides, we improve the LiDAR feature extractor by fusing the multi-scaled sparse convolutional features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our method achieves 77.6\% NDS accuracy on the nuScenes dataset, showcasing superior performance in the 3D object detection track.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sien Li, Tao Wang, Ruizhe Hu, Wenxi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS), weak-to-strong consistency regularization techniques are widely utilized in recent works, typically combined with input-level and feature-level perturbations. However, the integration between weak-to-strong consistency regularization and network perturbation has been relatively rare. We note several problems with existing network perturbations in SSS that may contribute to this phenomenon. By revisiting network perturbations, we introduce a new approach for network perturbation to expand the existing weak-to-strong consistency regularization for unlabeled data. Additionally, we present a volatile learning process for labeled data, which is uncommon in existing research. Building upon previous work that includes input-level and feature-level perturbations, we present MLPMatch (Multi-Level-Perturbation Match), an easy-to-implement and efficient framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. MLPMatch has been validated on the Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available from https://github.com/LlistenL/MLPMatch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Ma, Hongbin Zhou, Qiusheng Huang, Xuemeng Yang, Jianfei Guo, Bo Zhang, Min Dou, Yu Qiao, Botian Shi, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Offboard perception aims to automatically generate high-quality 3D labels for autonomous driving (AD) scenes. Existing offboard methods focus on 3D object detection with closed-set taxonomy and fail to match human-level recognition capability on the rapidly evolving perception tasks. Due to heavy reliance on human labels and the prevalence of data imbalance and sparsity, a unified framework for offboard auto-labeling various elements in AD scenes that meets the distinct needs of perception tasks is not being fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal Zero-shot Offboard Panoptic Perception (ZOPP) framework for autonomous driving scenes. ZOPP integrates the powerful zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision foundation models and 3D representations derived from point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, ZOPP represents a pioneering effort in the domain of multi-modal panoptic perception and auto labeling for autonomous driving scenes. We conduct comprehensive empirical studies and evaluations on Waymo open dataset to validate the proposed ZOPP on various perception tasks. To further explore the usability and extensibility of our proposed ZOPP, we also conduct experiments in downstream applications. The results further demonstrate the great potential of our ZOPP for real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Al Asif, Farhana Chowdhury Tisha</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the deadliest pandemics is now happening in the current world due to COVID-19. This contagious virus is spreading like wildfire around the whole world. To minimize the spreading of this virus, World Health Organization (WHO) has made protocols mandatory for wearing face masks and maintaining 6 feet physical distance. In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0. So, with this system, we can identify high-risk areas with the highest possibility of the virus spreading zone. This may help authorities to take necessary steps to locate those risky areas and alert the local people to ensure proper precautions in no time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentang Song, Zhiyuan Yan, Yuzhen Lin, Taiping Yao, Changsheng Chen, Shen Chen, Yandan Zhao, Shouhong Ding, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the generalization issue in deepfake detection by harnessing forgery quality in training data. Generally, the forgery quality of different deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while others are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of deepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to short-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby hurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel quality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of a Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning pacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training process. The framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to gradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples, starting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ both static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining their scores to produce a final rating for each training sample. The rating score guides the selection of deepfake samples for training, with higher-rated samples having a higher probability of being chosen. Furthermore, we propose a novel frequency data augmentation method specifically designed for low-quality forgery samples, which helps to reduce obvious forgery traces and improve their overall realism. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied in a plug-and-play manner and significantly enhance the generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hankyeol Lee, Gawon Seo, Wonseok Choi, Geunyoung Jung, Kyungwoo Song, Jiyoung Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, in visual classification tasks, has been enhanced by leveraging semantic knowledge from large language models (LLMs), including GPT. Recent studies have shown that in zero-shot classification tasks, descriptors incorporating additional cues, high-level concepts, or even random characters often outperform those using only the category name. In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy may be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher. This gap implies that most misclassifications occur among a few similar classes, highlighting the model's difficulty in distinguishing between classes with subtle differences. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of comparative descriptors. These descriptors emphasize the unique features of a target class against its most similar classes, enhancing differentiation. By generating and integrating these comparative descriptors into the classification framework, we refine the semantic focus and improve classification accuracy. An additional filtering process ensures that these descriptors are closer to the image embeddings in the CLIP space, further enhancing performance. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness in visual classification tasks by addressing the specific challenge of subtle inter-class differences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agricultural landscapes are quite complex, especially in the Global South where fields are smaller, and agricultural practices are more varied. In this paper we report on our progress in digitizing the agricultural landscape (natural and man-made) in our study region of India. We use high resolution imagery and a UNet style segmentation model to generate the first of its kind national-scale multi-class panoptic segmentation output. Through this work we have been able to identify individual fields across 151.7M hectares, and delineating key features such as water resources and vegetation. We share how this output was validated by our team and externally by downstream users, including some sample use cases that can lead to targeted data driven decision making. We believe this dataset will contribute towards digitizing agriculture by generating the foundational baselayer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Zhang, Junkai Deng, Xuhui Chen, Fei Hou, Wencheng Wang, Hong Qin, Chen Qian, Ying He</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional 3D shape reconstruction techniques from multi-view images, such as structure from motion and multi-view stereo, primarily focus on opaque surfaces. Similarly, recent advances in neural radiance fields and its variants also primarily address opaque objects, encountering difficulties with the complex lighting effects caused by transparent materials. This paper introduces $\alpha$-NeuS, a new method for simultaneously reconstructing thin transparent objects and opaque objects based on neural implicit surfaces (NeuS). Our method leverages the observation that transparent surfaces induce local extreme values in the learned distance fields during neural volumetric rendering, contrasting with opaque surfaces that align with zero level sets. Traditional iso-surfacing algorithms such as marching cubes, which rely on fixed iso-values, are ill-suited for this data. We address this by taking the absolute value of the distance field and developing an optimization method that extracts level sets corresponding to both non-negative local minima and zero iso-values. We prove that the reconstructed surfaces are unbiased for both transparent and opaque objects. To validate our approach, we construct a benchmark that includes both real-world and synthetic scenes, demonstrating its practical utility and effectiveness. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/728388808/alpha-NeuS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang rui, Meng ling-tao, Zhang qiu-yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal biometric authentication methods address the limitations of unimodal biometric technologies in security, robustness, and user adaptability. However, most existing methods depend on fixed combinations and numbers of biometric modalities, which restricts flexibility and adaptability in real-world applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose an adaptive multimodal biometric authentication model, AuthFormer, tailored for elderly users. AuthFormer is trained on the LUTBIO multimodal biometric database, containing biometric data from elderly individuals. By incorporating a cross-attention mechanism and a Gated Residual Network (GRN), the model improves adaptability to physiological variations in elderly users. Experiments show that AuthFormer achieves an accuracy of 99.73%. Additionally, its encoder requires only two layers to perform optimally, reducing complexity compared to traditional Transformer-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faezeh Zakeri, Raphael Braun, Lukas Ruppert, Henrik P. A. Lensch</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D geometric shape completion hinges on representation learning and a deep understanding of geometric data. Without profound insights into the three-dimensional nature of the data, this task remains unattainable. Our work addresses this challenge of 3D shape completion given partial observations by proposing a transformer operating on the latent space representing Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). Instead of a monolithic volume, the SDF of an object is partitioned into smaller high-resolution patches leading to a sequence of latent codes. The approach relies on a smooth latent space encoding learned via a variational autoencoder (VAE), trained on millions of 3D patches. We employ an efficient masked autoencoder transformer to complete partial sequences into comprehensive shapes in latent space. Our approach is extensively evaluated on partial observations from ShapeNet and the ABC dataset where only fractions of the objects are given. The proposed POC-SLT architecture compares favorably with several baseline state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a significant improvement in 3D shape completion, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alakh Desai, Nuno Vasconcelos</p>
<p>Abstract: For image generation with diffusion models (DMs), a negative prompt n can be used to complement the text prompt p, helping define properties not desired in the synthesized image. While this improves prompt adherence and image quality, finding good negative prompts is challenging. We argue that this is due to a semantic gap between humans and DMs, which makes good negative prompts for DMs appear unintuitive to humans. To bridge this gap, we propose a new diffusion-negative prompting (DNP) strategy. DNP is based on a new procedure to sample images that are least compliant with p under the distribution of the DM, denoted as diffusion-negative sampling (DNS). Given p, one such image is sampled, which is then translated into natural language by the user or a captioning model, to produce the negative prompt n*. The pair (p, n*) is finally used to prompt the DM. DNS is straightforward to implement and requires no training. Experiments and human evaluations show that DNP performs well both quantitatively and qualitatively and can be easily combined with several DM variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanuk Yang, Hayeon O, Kunsoo Huh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel algorithm for vehicle speed-aided monocular visual-inertial localization using a topological map. The proposed system aims to address the limitations of existing methods that rely heavily on expensive sensors like GPS and LiDAR by leveraging relatively inexpensive camera-based pose estimation. The topological map is generated offline from LiDAR point clouds and includes depth images, intensity images, and corresponding camera poses. This map is then used for real-time localization through correspondence matching between current camera images and the stored topological images. The system employs an Iterated Error State Kalman Filter (IESKF) for optimized pose estimation, incorporating correspondence among images and vehicle speed measurements to enhance accuracy. Experimental results using both open dataset and our collected data in challenging scenario, such as tunnel, demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance in topological map generation and localization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingkai Zhu, Can Deniz Bezek, Orcun Goksel</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the increasing size of deep learning models and their growing demand for computational resources have drawn significant attention to the practice of pruning neural networks, while aiming to preserve their accuracy. In unstructured gradual pruning, which sparsifies a network by gradually removing individual network parameters until a targeted network sparsity is reached, recent works show that both gradient and weight magnitudes should be considered. In this work, we show that such mechanism, e.g., the order of prioritization and selection criteria, is essential. We introduce a gradient-first magnitude-next strategy for choosing the parameters to prune, and show that a fixed-rate subselection criterion between these steps works better, in contrast to the annealing approach in the literature. We validate this on CIFAR-10 dataset, with multiple randomized initializations on both VGG-19 and ResNet-50 network backbones, for pruning targets of 90, 95, and 98% sparsity and for both initially dense and 50% sparse networks. Our proposed fixed-rate gradient-first gradual pruning (FGGP) approach outperforms its state-of-the-art alternatives in most of the above experimental settings, even occasionally surpassing the upperbound of corresponding dense network results, and having the highest ranking across the considered experimental settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing demand for accurate and equitable AI models in digital dermatology faces a significant challenge: the lack of diverse, high-quality labeled data. In this work, we investigate the potential of domain-specific foundation models for dermatology in addressing this challenge. We utilize self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to pre-train models on a dataset of over 240,000 dermatological images from public and private collections. Our study considers several SSL methods and compares the resulting foundation models against domain-agnostic models like those pre-trained on ImageNet and state-of-the-art models such as MONET across 12 downstream tasks. Unlike previous research, we emphasize the development of smaller models that are more suitable for resource-limited clinical settings, facilitating easier adaptation to a broad range of use cases. Results show that models pre-trained in this work not only outperform general-purpose models but also approach the performance of models 50 times larger on clinically relevant diagnostic tasks. To promote further research in this direction, we publicly release both the training code and the foundation models, which can benefit clinicians in dermatological applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The accurate alignment of 3D woodblock geometrical models with 2D orthographic projection images presents a significant challenge in the digital preservation of Vietnamese cultural heritage. This paper proposes a unified image processing algorithm to address this issue, enhancing the registration quality between 3D woodblock models and their 2D representations. The method includes determining the plane of the 3D character model, establishing a transformation matrix to align this plane with the 2D printed image plane, and creating a parallel-projected depth map for precise alignment. This process minimizes disocclusions and ensures that character shapes and strokes are correctly positioned. Experimental results highlight the importance of structure-based comparisons to optimize alignment for large-scale Han-Nom character datasets. The proposed approach, combining density-based and structure-based methods, demonstrates improved registration performance, offering an effective normalization scheme for digital heritage preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Song, Xiaofeng Yang, Ze Yang, Guosheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong few-shot customization for text-to-image diffusion aims to continually generalize existing models for new tasks with minimal data while preserving old knowledge. Current customization diffusion models excel in few-shot tasks but struggle with catastrophic forgetting problems in lifelong generations. In this study, we identify and categorize the catastrophic forgetting problems into two folds: relevant concepts forgetting and previous concepts forgetting. To address these challenges, we first devise a data-free knowledge distillation strategy to tackle relevant concepts forgetting. Unlike existing methods that rely on additional real data or offline replay of original concept data, our approach enables on-the-fly knowledge distillation to retain the previous concepts while learning new ones, without accessing any previous data. Second, we develop an In-Context Generation (ICGen) paradigm that allows the diffusion model to be conditioned upon the input vision context, which facilitates the few-shot generation and mitigates the issue of previous concepts forgetting. Extensive experiments show that the proposed Lifelong Few-Shot Diffusion (LFS-Diffusion) method can produce high-quality and accurate images while maintaining previously learned knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Berral-Soler, Rafael Mu\~noz-Salinas, Rafael Medina-Carnicer, Manuel J. Mar\'in-Jim\'enez</p>
<p>Abstract: Fiducial markers are a computer vision tool used for object pose estimation and detection. These markers are highly useful in fields such as industry, medicine and logistics. However, optimal lighting conditions are not always available,and other factors such as blur or sensor noise can affect image quality. Classical computer vision techniques that precisely locate and decode fiducial markers often fail under difficult illumination conditions (e.g. extreme variations of lighting within the same frame). Hence, we propose DeepArUco++, a deep learning-based framework that leverages the robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks to perform marker detection and decoding in challenging lighting conditions. The framework is based on a pipeline using different Neural Network models at each step, namely marker detection, corner refinement and marker decoding. Additionally, we propose a simple method for generating synthetic data for training the different models that compose the proposed pipeline, and we present a second, real-life dataset of ArUco markers in challenging lighting conditions used to evaluate our system. The developed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in such tasks and remains competitive even when testing on the datasets used to develop those methods.

Traditional methods can be divided into two categories, one is absolute radiation correction and the other is relative radiation normalization. We propose a NeRF-based method of color consistency correction for multi-view images, which weaves image features together using implicit expressions, and then re-illuminates feature space to generate a fusion image with a new perspective. We chose Superview-1 satellite images and UAV images with large range and time difference for the experiment. Experimental results show that the synthesize image generated by our method has excellent visual effect and smooth color transition at the edges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laure Ciernik, Lorenz Linhardt, Marco Morik, Jonas Dippel, Simon Kornblith, Lukas Muttenthaler</p>
<p>Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis claims that recent foundation models are converging to a shared representation space as a function of their downstream task performance, irrespective of the objectives and data modalities used to train these models. Representational similarity is generally measured for individual datasets and is not necessarily consistent across datasets. Thus, one may wonder whether this convergence of model representations is confounded by the datasets commonly used in machine learning. Here, we propose a systematic way to measure how representational similarity between models varies with the set of stimuli used to construct the representations. We find that the objective function is the most crucial factor in determining the consistency of representational similarities across datasets. Specifically, self-supervised vision models learn representations whose relative pairwise similarities generalize better from one dataset to another compared to those of image classification or image-text models. Moreover, the correspondence between representational similarities and the models' task behavior is dataset-dependent, being most strongly pronounced for single-domain datasets. Our work provides a framework for systematically measuring similarities of model representations across datasets and linking those similarities to differences in task behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: In real-world applications where confidence is key, like autonomous driving, the accurate detection and appropriate handling of classes differing from those used during training are crucial. Despite the proposal of various unknown object detection approaches, we have observed widespread inconsistencies among them regarding the datasets, metrics, and scenarios used, alongside a notable absence of a clear definition for unknown objects, which hampers meaningful evaluation. To counter these issues, we introduce two benchmarks: a unified VOC-COCO evaluation, and the new OpenImagesRoad benchmark which provides clear hierarchical object definition besides new evaluation metrics. Complementing the benchmark, we exploit recent self-supervised Vision Transformers performance, to improve pseudo-labeling-based OpenSet Object Detection (OSOD), through OW-DETR++. State-of-the-art methods are extensively evaluated on the proposed benchmarks. This study provides a clear problem definition, ensures consistent evaluations, and draws new conclusions about effectiveness of OSOD strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early identification of stroke is crucial for intervention, requiring reliable models. We proposed an efficient retinal image representation together with clinical information to capture a comprehensive overview of cardiovascular health, leveraging large multimodal datasets for new medical insights. Our approach is one of the first contrastive frameworks that integrates graph and tabular data, using vessel graphs derived from retinal images for efficient representation. This method, combined with multimodal contrastive learning, significantly enhances stroke prediction accuracy by integrating data from multiple sources and using contrastive learning for transfer learning. The self-supervised learning techniques employed allow the model to learn effectively from unlabeled data, reducing the dependency on large annotated datasets. Our framework showed an AUROC improvement of 3.78% from supervised to self-supervised approaches. Additionally, the graph-level representation approach achieved superior performance to image encoders while significantly reducing pre-training and fine-tuning runtimes. These findings indicate that retinal images are a cost-effective method for improving cardiovascular disease predictions and pave the way for future research into retinal and cerebral vessel connections and the use of graph-based retinal vessel representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristiano Patr\'icio, Lu\'is F. Teixeira, Jo\~ao C. Neves</p>
<p>Abstract: The main challenges hindering the adoption of deep learning-based systems in clinical settings are the scarcity of annotated data and the lack of interpretability and trust in these systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, this inherent interpretability comes at the cost of greater annotation burden. Additionally, adding new concepts requires retraining the entire system. In this work, we introduce a novel two-step methodology that addresses both of these challenges. By simulating the two stages of a CBM, we utilize a pretrained Vision Language Model (VLM) to automatically predict clinical concepts, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate disease diagnoses based on the predicted concepts. We validate our approach on three skin lesion datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms traditional CBMs and state-of-the-art explainable methods, all without requiring any training and utilizing only a few annotated examples.

Therefore, we present SynDroneVision, a synthetic dataset specifically designed for RGB-based drone detection in surveillance applications. Featuring diverse backgrounds, lighting conditions, and drone models, SynDroneVision offers a comprehensive training foundation for deep learning algorithms. To evaluate the dataset's effectiveness, we perform a comparative analysis across a selection of recent YOLO detection models. Our findings demonstrate that SynDroneVision is a valuable resource for real-world data enrichment, achieving notable enhancements in model performance and robustness, while significantly reducing the time and costs of real-world data acquisition. SynDroneVision will be publicly released upon paper acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuowen Yin, Chengru Li, Xingbo Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the challenges of high computational costs and long-distance dependencies in exist ing video understanding methods, such as CNNs and Transformers, this work introduces RWKV to the video domain in a novel way. We propose a LSTM CrossRWKV (LCR) framework, designed for spatiotemporal representation learning to tackle the video understanding task. Specifically, the proposed linear complexity LCR incorporates a novel Cross RWKV gate to facilitate interaction be tween current frame edge information and past features, enhancing the focus on the subject through edge features and globally aggregating inter-frame features over time. LCR stores long-term mem ory for video processing through an enhanced LSTM recurrent execution mechanism. By leveraging the Cross RWKV gate and recurrent execution, LCR effectively captures both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, the edge information serves as a forgetting gate for LSTM, guiding long-term memory management.Tube masking strategy reduces redundant information in food and reduces overfitting.These advantages enable LSTM CrossRWKV to set a new benchmark in video under standing, offering a scalable and efficient solution for comprehensive video analysis. All code and models are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiwen Wei, Guihong Li, Radu Marculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in online continual learning (OCL), especially for non-stationary data streams that do not have well-defined task boundaries. This challenge is exacerbated by the memory constraints and privacy concerns inherent in rehearsal buffers. To tackle catastrophic forgetting, in this paper, we introduce Online-LoRA, a novel framework for task-free OCL. Online-LoRA allows to finetune pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models in real-time to address the limitations of rehearsal buffers and leverage pre-trained models' performance benefits. As the main contribution, our approach features a novel online weight regularization strategy to identify and consolidate important model parameters. Moreover, Online-LoRA leverages the training dynamics of loss values to enable the automatic recognition of the data distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across many task-free OCL scenarios and benchmark datasets (including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-S, CUB-200 and CORe50) demonstrate that Online-LoRA can be robustly adapted to various ViT architectures, while achieving better performance compared to SOTA methods. Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/Christina200/Online-LoRA-official.git.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05679">Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation Through Text</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiulong Liu, Kun Su, Eli Shlizerman</p>
<p>Abstract: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhisek Ray, Ayush Raj, Maheshkumar H. Kolekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting multiscale contextual information and higher-order correlations among skeleton sequences using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) alone is inadequate for effective action classification. Hypergraph convolution addresses the above issues but cannot harness the long-range dependencies. Transformer proves to be effective in capturing these dependencies and making complex contextual features accessible. We propose an Autoregressive Adaptive HyperGraph Transformer (AutoregAd-HGformer) model for in-phase (autoregressive and discrete) and out-phase (adaptive) hypergraph generation. The vector quantized in-phase hypergraph equipped with powerful autoregressive learned priors produces a more robust and informative representation suitable for hyperedge formation. The out-phase hypergraph generator provides a model-agnostic hyperedge learning technique to align the attributes with input skeleton embedding. The hybrid (supervised and unsupervised) learning in AutoregAd-HGformer explores the action-dependent feature along spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions. The extensive experimental results and ablation study indicate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art hypergraph architectures on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio De Santis, Riccardo Campi, Matteo Bianchi, Marco Brambilla</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have seen significant performance improvements in recent years. However, due to their size and complexity, they function as black-boxes, leading to transparency concerns. State-of-the-art saliency methods generate local explanations that highlight the area in the input image where a class is identified but cannot explain how a concept of interest contributes to the prediction, which is essential for bias mitigation. On the other hand, concept-based methods, such as TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors), provide insights into how sensitive is the network to a concept, but cannot compute its attribution in a specific prediction nor show its location within the input image. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc explainability framework, Visual-TCAV, which aims to bridge the gap between these methods by providing both local and global explanations for CNN-based image classification. Visual-TCAV uses Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to generate saliency maps that show where concepts are recognized by the network. Moreover, it can estimate the attribution of these concepts to the output of any class using a generalization of Integrated Gradients. This framework is evaluated on popular CNN architectures, with its validity further confirmed via experiments where ground truth for explanations is known, and a comparison with TCAV. Our code will be made available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kourosh Kiani, Razieh Rastgoo, Alireza Chaji, Sergio Escalera</p>
<p>Abstract: Image inpainting, the process of restoring missing or corrupted regions of an image by reconstructing pixel information, has recently seen considerable advancements through deep learning-based approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning-based pre-processing methodology for image inpainting utilizing the Vision Transformer (ViT). Our approach involves replacing masked pixel values with those generated by the ViT, leveraging diverse visual patches within the attention matrix to capture discriminative spatial features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of such a pre-processing model being proposed for image inpainting tasks. Furthermore, we show that our methodology can be effectively applied using the pre-trained ViT model with pre-defined patch size. To evaluate the generalization capability of the proposed methodology, we provide experimental results comparing our approach with four standard models across four public datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of our pre-processing technique in enhancing inpainting performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia-Hong Huang, Hongyi Zhu, Yixian Shen, Stevan Rudinac, Evangelos Kanoulas</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the quality of automatically generated image descriptions is a complex task that requires metrics capturing various dimensions, such as grammaticality, coverage, accuracy, and truthfulness. Although human evaluation provides valuable insights, its cost and time-consuming nature pose limitations. Existing automated metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and CIDEr attempt to fill this gap, but they often exhibit weak correlations with human judgment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evaluation framework called Image2Text2Image, which leverages diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E, for text-to-image generation. In the Image2Text2Image framework, an input image is first processed by a selected image captioning model, chosen for evaluation, to generate a textual description. Using this generated description, a diffusion model then creates a new image. By comparing features extracted from the original and generated images, we measure their similarity using a designated similarity metric. A high similarity score suggests that the model has produced a faithful textual description, while a low score highlights discrepancies, revealing potential weaknesses in the model's performance. Notably, our framework does not rely on human-annotated reference captions, making it a valuable tool for assessing image captioning models. Extensive experiments and human evaluations validate the efficacy of our proposed Image2Text2Image evaluation framework. The code and dataset will be published to support further research in the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ethan King, Jaime Rodriguez, Diego Llanes, Timothy Doster, Tegan Emerson, James Koch</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a sensor-agnostic spectral transformer as the basis for spectral foundation models. To that end, we introduce a Universal Spectral Representation (USR) that leverages sensor meta-data, such as sensing kernel specifications and sensing wavelengths, to encode spectra obtained from any spectral instrument into a common representation, such that a single model can ingest data from any sensor. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for pre-training such models in a self-supervised manner using a novel random sensor-augmentation and reconstruction pipeline to learn spectral features independent of the sensing paradigm. We demonstrate that our architecture can learn sensor independent spectral features that generalize effectively to sensors not seen during training. This work sets the stage for training foundation models that can both leverage and be effective for the growing diversity of spectral data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in structured 3D Gaussians for view-adaptive rendering, particularly through methods like Scaffold-GS, have demonstrated promising results in neural scene representation. However, existing approaches still face challenges in perceptual consistency and precise view-dependent effects. We present PEP-GS, a novel framework that enhances structured 3D Gaussians through three key innovations: (1) a Local-Enhanced Multi-head Self-Attention (LEMSA) mechanism that replaces spherical harmonics for more accurate view-dependent color decoding, and (2) Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) that optimize Gaussian opacity and covariance functions for enhanced interpretability and splatting precision. (3) a Neural Laplacian Pyramid Decomposition (NLPD) that improves perceptual similarity across views. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets indicates that, compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, these improvements are particularly evident in challenging scenarios such as view-dependent effects, specular reflections, fine-scale details and false geometry generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuze He, Yanning Zhou, Wang Zhao, Zhongkai Wu, Kaiwen Xiao, Wei Yang, Yong-Jin Liu, Xiao Han</p>
<p>Abstract: We present StdGEN, an innovative pipeline for generating semantically decomposed high-quality 3D characters from single images, enabling broad applications in virtual reality, gaming, and filmmaking, etc. Unlike previous methods which struggle with limited decomposability, unsatisfactory quality, and long optimization times, StdGEN features decomposability, effectiveness and efficiency; i.e., it generates intricately detailed 3D characters with separated semantic components such as the body, clothes, and hair, in three minutes. At the core of StdGEN is our proposed Semantic-aware Large Reconstruction Model (S-LRM), a transformer-based generalizable model that jointly reconstructs geometry, color and semantics from multi-view images in a feed-forward manner. A differentiable multi-layer semantic surface extraction scheme is introduced to acquire meshes from hybrid implicit fields reconstructed by our S-LRM. Additionally, a specialized efficient multi-view diffusion model and an iterative multi-layer surface refinement module are integrated into the pipeline to facilitate high-quality, decomposable 3D character generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance in 3D anime character generation, surpassing existing baselines by a significant margin in geometry, texture and decomposability. StdGEN offers ready-to-use semantic-decomposed 3D characters and enables flexible customization for a wide range of applications. Project page: https://stdgen.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite advances with deep learning (DL), automated airway segmentation from chest CT scans continues to face challenges in segmentation quality and generalization across cohorts. To address these, we propose integrating Curriculum Learning (CL) into airway segmentation networks, distributing the training set into batches according to ad-hoc complexity scores derived from CT scans and corresponding ground-truth tree features. We specifically investigate few-shot domain adaptation, targeting scenarios where manual annotation of a full fine-tuning dataset is prohibitively expensive. Results are reported on two large open-cohorts (ATM22 and AIIB23) with high performance using CL for full training (Source domain) and few-shot fine-tuning (Target domain), but with also some insights on potential detrimental effects if using a classic Bootstrapping scoring function or if not using proper scan sequencing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical eye-tracking data is an important information source for understanding how radiologists visually interpret medical images. This information not only improves the accuracy of deep learning models for X-ray analysis but also their interpretability, enhancing transparency in decision-making. However, the current eye-tracking data is dispersed, unprocessed, and ambiguous, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights. Therefore, there is a need to create a new dataset with more focus and purposeful eyetracking data, improving its utility for diagnostic applications. In this work, we propose a refinement method inspired by the target-present visual search challenge: there is a specific finding and fixations are guided to locate it. After refining the existing eye-tracking datasets, we transform them into a curated visual search dataset, called GazeSearch, specifically for radiology findings, where each fixation sequence is purposefully aligned to the task of locating a particular finding. Subsequently, we introduce a scan path prediction baseline, called ChestSearch, specifically tailored to GazeSearch. Finally, we employ the newly introduced GazeSearch as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, offering a comprehensive assessment for visual search in the medical imaging domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Grounded radiology report generation (GRRG) extends RRG by including the localisation of individual findings on the image. Currently, there are no manually annotated chest X-ray (CXR) datasets to train GRRG models. In this work, we present a dataset called PadChest-GR (Grounded-Reporting) derived from PadChest aimed at training GRRG models for CXR images. We curate a public bi-lingual dataset of 4,555 CXR studies with grounded reports (3,099 abnormal and 1,456 normal), each containing complete lists of sentences describing individual present (positive) and absent (negative) findings in English and Spanish. In total, PadChest-GR contains 7,037 positive and 3,422 negative finding sentences. Every positive finding sentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes labelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type, locations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the first manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding and interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed localization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings, it provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from CXR images.

<p>Abstract: Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) affects 1 to 5 out of every 1,000 newborns, with 30% to 50% of cases resulting in adverse neurocognitive outcomes. However, these outcomes can only be reliably assessed as early as age 2. Therefore, early and accurate prediction of HIE-related neurocognitive outcomes using deep learning models is critical for improving clinical decision-making, guiding treatment decisions and assessing novel therapies. However, a major challenge in developing deep learning models for this purpose is the scarcity of large, annotated HIE datasets. We have assembled the first and largest public dataset, however it contains only 156 cases with 2-year neurocognitive outcome labels. In contrast, we have collected 8,859 normal brain black Magnetic Resonance Imagings (MRIs) with 0-97 years of age that are available for brain age estimation using deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce AGE2HIE to transfer knowledge learned by deep learning models from healthy controls brain MRIs to a diseased cohort, from structural to diffusion MRIs, from regression of continuous age estimation to prediction of the binary neurocognitive outcomes, and from lifespan age (0-97 years) to infant (0-2 weeks). Compared to training from scratch, transfer learning from brain age estimation significantly improves not only the prediction accuracy (3% or 2% improvement in same or multi-site), but also the model generalization across different sites (5% improvement in cross-site validation).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siting Li, Pang Wei Koh, Simon Shaolei Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research suggests that the failures of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) at visual reasoning often stem from erroneous agreements -- when semantically distinct images are ambiguously encoded by the CLIP image encoder into embeddings with high cosine similarity. In this paper, we show that erroneous agreements are not always the main culprit, as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can still extract distinct information from them. For instance, when distinguishing objects on the left vs right in the What'sUp benchmark, the CLIP image embeddings of the left/right pairs have an average cosine similarity $>0.99$, and CLIP performs at random chance; but LLaVA-1.5-7B, which uses the same CLIP image encoder, achieves nearly $100\%$ accuracy. We find that the extractable information in CLIP image embeddings is likely obscured by CLIP's inadequate vision-language alignment: Its matching score learned by the contrastive objective might not capture all diverse image-text correspondences. We also study the MMVP benchmark, on which prior work has shown that LLaVA-1.5 cannot distinguish image pairs with high cosine similarity. We observe a performance gain brought by attending more to visual input through an alternative decoding algorithm. Further, the accuracy significantly increases if the model can take both images as input to emphasize their nuanced differences. Both findings indicate that LLaVA-1.5 did not utilize extracted visual information sufficiently. In conclusion, our findings suggest that while improving image encoders could benefit VLMs, there is still room to enhance models with a fixed image encoder by applying better strategies for extracting and utilizing visual information.</p>

We propose a method to evaluate the performance of such algorithms to enhance understanding of the behavior of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxiao Yu, Kuang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital imaging modality widely used in clinical diagnosis and preclinical research but faces limitations in image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio due to inherent physical degradation factors. Current deep learning-based denoising methods face challenges in adapting to the variability of clinical settings, influenced by factors such as scanner types, tracer choices, dose levels, and acquisition times. In this work, we proposed a novel 3D ControlNet-based denoising method for whole-body PET imaging. We first pre-trained a 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) using a large dataset of high-quality normal-dose PET images. Following this, we fine-tuned the model on a smaller set of paired low- and normal-dose PET images, integrating low-dose inputs through a 3D ControlNet architecture, thereby making the model adaptable to denoising tasks in diverse clinical settings. Experimental results based on clinical PET datasets show that the proposed framework outperformed other state-of-the-art PET image denoising methods both in visual quality and quantitative metrics. This plug-and-play approach allows large diffusion models to be fine-tuned and adapted to PET images from diverse acquisition protocols.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Zhang, Guo Lu, Huanxiong Liang, Zhengxue Cheng, Anni Tang, Li Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have advanced the development of 3D volumetric video technology, but the large data volumes they involve pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. To address these problems, the existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the training stage, leading to a separation between representation training and compression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF representation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed rate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a simple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the NeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model is utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy model is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF representation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby leading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive quantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF representations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for different representations and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on the HumanRF and ReRF datasets. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method TeTriRF, we achieved an approximately -80% BD-rate on the HumanRF dataset and -60% BD-rate on the ReRF dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Chen, Alan McMillan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient sub-model ensemble framework aimed at enhancing the interpretability of medical deep learning models, thus increasing their clinical applicability. By generating uncertainty maps, this framework enables end-users to evaluate the reliability of model outputs. We developed a strategy to develop diverse models from a single well-trained checkpoint, facilitating the training of a model family. This involves producing multiple outputs from a single input, fusing them into a final output, and estimating uncertainty based on output disagreements. Implemented using U-Net and UNETR models for segmentation and synthesis tasks, this approach was tested on CT body segmentation and MR-CT synthesis datasets. It achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 0.814 in segmentation and a Mean Absolute Error of 88.17 HU in synthesis, improved from 89.43 HU by pruning. Additionally, the framework was evaluated under corruption and undersampling, maintaining correlation between uncertainty and error, which highlights its robustness. These results suggest that the proposed approach not only maintains the performance of well-trained models but also enhances interpretability through effective uncertainty estimation, applicable to both convolutional and transformer models in a range of imaging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yo-Hwan Choi, Seon-Yu Kang, Minjong Cheon</p>
<p>Abstract: As global warming increases the complexity of weather patterns; the precision of weather forecasting becomes increasingly important. Our study proposes a novel preprocessing method and convolutional autoencoder model developed to improve the interpretation of synoptic weather maps. These are critical for meteorologists seeking a thorough understanding of weather conditions. This model could recognize historical synoptic weather maps that nearly match current atmospheric conditions, marking a significant step forward in modern technology in meteorological forecasting. This comprises unsupervised learning models like VQ-VQE, as well as supervised learning models like VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 trained on the ImageNet dataset, as well as research into newer models like EfficientNet and ConvNeXt. Our findings proved that, while these models perform well in various settings, their ability to identify comparable synoptic weather maps has certain limits. Our research, motivated by the primary goal of significantly increasing meteorologists' efficiency in labor-intensive tasks, discovered that cosine similarity is the most effective metric, as determined by a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments to accurately identify relevant historical weather patterns. This study broadens our understanding by shifting the emphasis from numerical precision to practical application, ensuring that our model is effective in theory practical, and accessible in the complex and dynamic field of meteorology.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Earth's weather system encompasses intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongwoo Lee, Kwangsuk Park, Jihyeon Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating accurate and consistent visual aids is a critical challenge in mathematics education, where visual representations like geometric shapes and functions play a pivotal role in enhancing student comprehension. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of complex mathematical visualizations alongside coherent problem text. Our approach not only simplifies the generation of precise visual aids but also aligns these aids with the problem's core mathematical concepts, improving both problem creation and assessment. By integrating multiple agents, each responsible for distinct tasks such as numeric calculation, geometry validation, and visualization, our system delivers mathematically accurate and contextually relevant problems with visual aids. Evaluation across Geometry and Function problem types shows that our method significantly outperforms basic LLMs in terms of text coherence, consistency, relevance and similarity, while maintaining the essential geometrical and functional integrity of the original problems. Although some challenges remain in ensuring consistent visual outputs, our framework demonstrates the immense potential of LLMs in transforming the way educators generate and utilize visual aids in math education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Imran Hossain, Muhammad Zain Amin, Daniel Tweneboah Anyimadu, Taofik Ahmed Suleiman</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic brain tissue segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is vital for accurate diagnosis and further analysis in medical imaging. Despite advancements in segmentation techniques, a comprehensive comparison between traditional statistical methods and modern deep learning approaches using pre-processing techniques like N4 Bias Field Correction and Anisotropic Diffusion remains underexplored. This study provides a comparative analysis of various segmentation models, including Probabilistic ATLAS, U-Net, nnU-Net, and LinkNet, enhanced with these pre-processing techniques to segment brain tissues (white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR18) dataset. Our results demonstrate that the 3D nnU-Net model outperforms others, achieving the highest mean Dice Coefficient score (0.937 +- 0.012), while the 2D nnU-Net model recorded the lowest mean Hausdorff Distance (5.005 +- 0.343 mm) and the lowest mean Absolute Volumetric Difference (3.695 +- 2.931 mm) across five unseen test samples. The findings highlight the superiority of nnU-Net models in brain tissue segmentation, particularly when combined with N4 Bias Field Correction and Anisotropic Diffusion pre-processing techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonah K\"omen, Hannah Marienwald, Jonas Dippel, Julius Hense</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has led to remarkable advancements in computational histopathology, e.g., in diagnostics, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognosis. Yet, the lack of annotated data and the impact of batch effects, e.g., systematic technical data differences across hospitals, hamper model robustness and generalization. Recent histopathological foundation models -- pretrained on millions to billions of images -- have been reported to improve generalization performances on various downstream tasks. However, it has not been systematically assessed whether they fully eliminate batch effects. In this study, we empirically show that the feature embeddings of the foundation models still contain distinct hospital signatures that can lead to biased predictions and misclassifications. We further find that the signatures are not removed by stain normalization methods, dominate distances in feature space, and are evident across various principal components. Our work provides a novel perspective on the evaluation of medical foundation models, paving the way for more robust pretraining strategies and downstream predictors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulkadir Gokce, Martin Schrimpf</p>
<p>Abstract: When trained on large-scale object classification datasets, certain artificial neural network models begin to approximate core object recognition (COR) behaviors and neural response patterns in the primate visual ventral stream (VVS). While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling model size, dataset size, and compute resources improve task performance, the impact of scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore scaling laws for modeling the primate VVS by systematically evaluating over 600 models trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4, IT and COR behaviors. We observe that while behavioral alignment continues to scale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains true across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with stronger inductive bias and datasets with higher-quality images are more compute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level visual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor alignment. Finally, we develop a scaling recipe, indicating that a greater proportion of compute should be allocated to data samples over model size. Our results suggest that while scaling alone might suffice for alignment with human core object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the brain's visual ventral stream with current architectures and datasets, highlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain-like models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreen Gul, Mohamed Elmahallawy, Sanjay Madria, Ardhendu Tripathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models are popular across various domains due to their remarkable performance and efficiency. However, their effectiveness relies heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which are often time-consuming and labor-intensive to generate manually. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to develop strategies that reduce reliance on extensive labeled data while preserving model performance. In this paper, we propose FisherMask, a Fisher information-based active learning (AL) approach that identifies key network parameters by masking them based on their Fisher information values. FisherMask enhances batch AL by using Fisher information to select the most critical parameters, allowing the identification of the most impactful samples during AL training. Moreover, Fisher information possesses favorable statistical properties, offering valuable insights into model behavior and providing a better understanding of the performance characteristics within the AL pipeline. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FisherMask significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10 and FashionMNIST, especially under imbalanced settings. These improvements lead to substantial gains in labeling efficiency. Hence serving as an effective tool to measure the sensitivity of model parameters to data samples.

<p>Abstract: We present VLMnav, an embodied framework to transform a Vision-Language Model (VLM) into an end-to-end navigation policy. In contrast to prior work, we do not rely on a separation between perception, planning, and control; instead, we use a VLM to directly select actions in one step. Surprisingly, we find that a VLM can be used as an end-to-end policy zero-shot, i.e., without any fine-tuning or exposure to navigation data. This makes our approach open-ended and generalizable to any downstream navigation task. We run an extensive study to evaluate the performance of our approach in comparison to baseline prompting methods. In addition, we perform a design analysis to understand the most impactful design decisions. Visual examples and code for our project can be found at https://jirl-upenn.github.io/VLMnav/</p>

<p>Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We then extend our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework -- Sketched Equivariant Deep Image Prior (Sk.EI-DIP), which can be efficiently applied for single-image and task-adapted reconstruction. Our numerical study on X-ray CT image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve order-of-magnitude computational acceleration over standard EI-based counterpart in single-input setting, and network adaptation at test time.</p>

To help address this, we introduce ASL STEM Wiki: a parallel corpus of 254 Wikipedia articles on STEM topics in English, interpreted into over 300 hours of American Sign Language (ASL). ASL STEM Wiki is the first continuous signing dataset focused on STEM, facilitating the development of AI resources for STEM education in ASL. We identify several use cases of ASL STEM Wiki with human-centered applications. For example, because this dataset highlights the frequent use of fingerspelling for technical concepts, which inhibits DHH students' ability to learn, we develop models to identify fingerspelled words -- which can later be used to query for appropriate ASL signs to suggest to interpreters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit surface representations such as the signed distance function (SDF) have emerged as a promising approach for image-based surface reconstruction. However, existing optimization methods assume solid surfaces and are therefore unable to properly reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces and thin structures, which also exhibit low opacity due to the blending effect with the background. While neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods can model semi-transparency and achieve photo-realistic quality in synthesized novel views, their volumetric geometry representation tightly couples geometry and opacity, and therefore cannot be easily converted into surfaces without introducing artifacts. We present $\alpha$Surf, a novel surface representation with decoupled geometry and opacity for the reconstruction of semi-transparent and thin surfaces where the colors mix. Ray-surface intersections on our representation can be found in closed-form via analytical solutions of cubic polynomials, avoiding Monte-Carlo sampling and is fully differentiable by construction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our approach can accurately reconstruct surfaces with semi-transparent and thin parts with fewer artifacts, achieving better reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art SDF and NeRF methods.

<p>Abstract: Recent works have proposed to craft adversarial clothes for evading person detectors, while they are either only effective at limited viewing angles or very conspicuous to humans. We aim to craft adversarial texture for clothes based on 3D modeling, an idea that has been used to craft rigid adversarial objects such as a 3D-printed turtle. Unlike rigid objects, humans and clothes are non-rigid, leading to difficulties in physical realization. In order to craft natural-looking adversarial clothes that can evade person detectors at multiple viewing angles, we propose adversarial camouflage textures (AdvCaT) that resemble one kind of the typical textures of daily clothes, camouflage textures. We leverage the Voronoi diagram and Gumbel-softmax trick to parameterize the camouflage textures and optimize the parameters via 3D modeling. Moreover, we propose an efficient augmentation pipeline on 3D meshes combining topologically plausible projection (TopoProj) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) to narrow the gap between digital and real-world objects. We printed the developed 3D texture pieces on fabric materials and tailored them into T-shirts and trousers. Experiments show high attack success rates of these clothes against multiple detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyuan Zhang, Zhenbo Song, Kaihao Zhang, Zhaoxin Fan, Jianfeng Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning based methods have achieved significant success in the task of single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, the majority of these methods are focused on High-Definition/Standard-Definition (HD/SD) images, while ignoring higher resolution images such as Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images. With the increasing prevalence of UHD images captured by modern devices, in this paper, we aim to address the problem of UHD SIRR. Specifically, we first synthesize two large-scale UHD datasets, UHDRR4K and UHDRR8K. The UHDRR4K dataset consists of $2,999$ and $168$ quadruplets of images for training and testing respectively, and the UHDRR8K dataset contains $1,014$ and $105$ quadruplets. To the best of our knowledge, these two datasets are the first largest-scale UHD datasets for SIRR. Then, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art SIRR methods using the proposed datasets. Based on the results, we provide detailed discussions regarding the strengths and limitations of these methods when applied to UHD images. Finally, we present a transformer-based architecture named RRFormer for reflection removal. RRFormer comprises three modules, namely the Prepossessing Embedding Module, Self-attention Feature Extraction Module, and Multi-scale Spatial Feature Extraction Module. These modules extract hypercolumn features, global and partial attention features, and multi-scale spatial features, respectively. To ensure effective training, we utilize three terms in our loss function: pixel loss, feature loss, and adversarial loss. We demonstrate through experimental results that RRFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the non-UHD dataset and our proposed UHDRR datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Feeney, Michael C. Hughes</p>
<p>Abstract: The information noise-contrastive estimation (InfoNCE) loss function provides the basis of many self-supervised deep learning methods due to its strong empirical results and theoretic motivation. Previous work suggests a supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss to extend InfoNCE to learn from available class labels. This SupCon loss has been widely-used due to reports of good empirical performance. However, in this work we find that the prior SupCon loss formulation has questionable justification because it can encourage some images from the same class to repel one another in the learned embedding space. This problematic intra-class repulsion gets worse as the number of images sharing one class label increases. We propose the Supervised InfoNCE REvisited (SINCERE) loss as a theoretically-justified supervised extension of InfoNCE that eliminates intra-class repulsion. Experiments show that SINCERE leads to better separation of embeddings from different classes and improves transfer learning classification accuracy. We additionally utilize probabilistic modeling to derive an information-theoretic bound that relates SINCERE loss to the symmeterized KL divergence between data-generating distributions for a target class and all other classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Feng, Jiachun Li, Changqing Miao, Jianjun Huang, Wei You, Wenchang Shi, Bin Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection has found extensive applications in various tasks, but it is also susceptible to adversarial patch attacks. The ideal defense should be effective, efficient, easy to deploy, and capable of withstanding adaptive attacks. In this paper, we adopt a counterattack strategy to propose a novel and general methodology for defending adversarial attacks. Two types of defensive patches, canary and woodpecker, are specially-crafted and injected into the model input to proactively probe or counteract potential adversarial patches. In this manner, adversarial patch attacks can be effectively detected by simply analyzing the model output, without the need to alter the target model. Moreover, we employ randomized canary and woodpecker injection patterns to defend against defense-aware attacks. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments. The results illustrate that canary and woodpecker achieve high performance, even when confronted with unknown attack methods, while incurring limited time overhead. Furthermore, our method also exhibits sufficient robustness against defense-aware attacks, as evidenced by adaptive attack experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maoyuan Ye, Jing Zhang, Juhua Liu, Chenyu Liu, Baocai Yin, Cong Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a profound vision foundation model pretrained on a large-scale dataset, breaks the boundaries of general segmentation and sparks various downstream applications. This paper introduces Hi-SAM, a unified model leveraging SAM for hierarchical text segmentation. Hi-SAM excels in segmentation across four hierarchies, including pixel-level text, word, text-line, and paragraph, while realizing layout analysis as well. Specifically, we first turn SAM into a high-quality pixel-level text segmentation (TS) model through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach. We use this TS model to iteratively generate the pixel-level text labels in a semi-automatical manner, unifying labels across the four text hierarchies in the HierText dataset. Subsequently, with these complete labels, we launch the end-to-end trainable Hi-SAM based on the TS architecture with a customized hierarchical mask decoder. During inference, Hi-SAM offers both automatic mask generation (AMG) mode and promptable segmentation (PS) mode. In the AMG mode, Hi-SAM segments pixel-level text foreground masks initially, then samples foreground points for hierarchical text mask generation and achieves layout analysis in passing. As for the PS mode, Hi-SAM provides word, text-line, and paragraph masks with a single point click. Experimental results show the state-of-the-art performance of our TS model: 84.86% fgIOU on Total-Text and 88.96% fgIOU on TextSeg for pixel-level text segmentation. Moreover, compared to the previous specialist for joint hierarchical detection and layout analysis on HierText, Hi-SAM achieves significant improvements: 4.73% PQ and 5.39% F1 on the text-line level, 5.49% PQ and 7.39% F1 on the paragraph level layout analysis, requiring $20\times$ fewer training epochs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Zhang, Guo Lu, Huanxiong Liang, Anni Tang, Qiang Hu, Li Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Volumetric videos, benefiting from immersive 3D realism and interactivity, hold vast potential for various applications, while the tremendous data volume poses significant challenges for compression. Recently, NeRF has demonstrated remarkable potential in volumetric video compression thanks to its simple representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities, where a notable work is ReRF. However, ReRF separates the modeling from compression process, resulting in suboptimal compression efficiency. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a volumetric video compression method based on dynamic NeRF in a more compact manner. Specifically, we decompose the NeRF representation into the coefficient fields and the basis fields, incrementally updating the basis fields in the temporal domain to achieve dynamic modeling. Additionally, we perform end-to-end joint optimization on the modeling and compression process to further improve the compression efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher compression efficiency compared to ReRF on various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ce Zhang, Simon Stepputtis, Katia Sycara, Yaqi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive zero-shot performance and transferability, allowing them to adapt to downstream tasks in a data-efficient manner. However, when only a few labeled samples are available, adapting VLMs to distinguish subtle differences between similar classes in specific downstream tasks remains challenging. In this work, we propose a Simple yet effective Negative Learning approach, SimNL, to more efficiently exploit the task-specific knowledge from few-shot labeled samples. Unlike previous methods that focus on identifying a set of representative positive features defining "what is a {CLASS}", SimNL discovers a complementary set of negative features that define "what is not a {CLASS}", providing additional insights that supplement the positive features to enhance task-specific recognition capability. Further, we identify that current adaptation approaches are particularly vulnerable to potential noise in the few-shot sample set. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play few-shot instance reweighting technique to suppress noisy outliers and amplify clean samples for more stable adaptation. Our extensive experimental results across 15 datasets validate that the proposed SimNL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both few-shot learning and domain generalization tasks while achieving competitive computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Chen, Daniel Barath, Iro Armeni, Marc Pollefeys, Hermann Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hritik Bansal, Yonatan Bitton, Michal Yarom, Idan Szpektor, Aditya Grover, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most of these text-to-video (T2V) generative models often produce single-scene video clips that depict an entity performing a particular action (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree'). However, it is pertinent to generate multi-scene videos since they are ubiquitous in the real-world (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree' followed by 'the red panda sleeps on the top of the tree'). To generate multi-scene videos from the pretrained T2V model, we introduce a simple and effective Time-Aligned Captions (TALC) framework. Specifically, we enhance the text-conditioning mechanism in the T2V architecture to recognize the temporal alignment between the video scenes and scene descriptions. For instance, we condition the visual features of the earlier and later scenes of the generated video with the representations of the first scene description (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree') and second scene description (e.g., 'the red panda sleeps on the top of the tree'), respectively. As a result, we show that the T2V model can generate multi-scene videos that adhere to the multi-scene text descriptions and be visually consistent (e.g., entity and background). Further, we finetune the pretrained T2V model with multi-scene video-text data using the TALC framework. We show that the TALC-finetuned model outperforms the baseline by achieving a relative gain of 29% in the overall score, which averages visual consistency and text adherence using human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boujemaa Guermazi, Naimul Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Our work tackles the fundamental challenge of image segmentation in computer vision, which is crucial for diverse applications. While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. We introduce DynaSeg, an innovative unsupervised image segmentation approach that overcomes the challenge of balancing feature similarity and spatial continuity without relying on extensive hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional methods, DynaSeg employs a dynamic weighting scheme that automates parameter tuning, adapts flexibly to image characteristics, and facilitates easy integration with other segmentation networks. By incorporating a Silhouette Score Phase, DynaSeg prevents undersegmentation failures where the number of predicted clusters might converge to one. DynaSeg uses CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, making it computationally efficient and more straightforward than other complex models. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement over current unsupervised segmentation approaches on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively. We provide qualitative and quantitative results on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusheng Li, Chengliang Wang, Shumao Wang, Zhuo Zeng, Ji Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The multi-line LiDAR is widely used in autonomous vehicles, so point cloud-based 3D detectors are essential for autonomous driving. Extracting rich multi-scale features is crucial for point cloud-based 3D detectors in autonomous driving due to significant differences in the size of different types of objects. However, because of the real-time requirements, large-size convolution kernels are rarely used to extract large-scale features in the backbone. Current 3D detectors commonly use feature pyramid networks to obtain large-scale features; however, some objects containing fewer point clouds are further lost during down-sampling, resulting in degraded performance. Since pillar-based schemes require much less computation than voxel-based schemes, they are more suitable for constructing real-time 3D detectors. Hence, we propose the *, a pillar-based scheme. We redesigned the feature encoding, the backbone, and the neck of the 3D detector. We propose the Voxel2Pillar feature encoding, which uses a sparse convolution constructor to construct pillars with richer point cloud features, especially height features. The Voxel2Pillar adds more learnable parameters to the feature encoding, enabling the initial pillars to have higher performance ability. We extract multi-scale and large-scale features in the proposed fully sparse backbone, which does not utilize large-size convolutional kernels; the backbone consists of the proposed multi-scale feature extraction module. The neck consists of the proposed sparse ConvNeXt, whose simple structure significantly improves the performance. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed * on the Waymo Open Dataset, and the object detection accuracy for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists is improved. We also verify the effectiveness of each proposed module in detail through ablation studies.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01914">HPE-CogVLM: Advancing Vision Language Models with a Head Pose Grounding Task</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Tian, Tianqi Shao, Tsukasa Demizu, Xuyang Wu, Hsin-Tai Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) requires a sophisticated understanding of 3D spatial relationships to generate precise yaw, pitch, and roll angles. Previous HPE models, primarily CNN-based, rely on cropped close-up human head images as inputs and often lack robustness in real-world scenario. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can analyze entire images while focusing on specific objects through their attention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve the HPE accuracy by leveraging the object detection grounding capability of a VLM, referred to as CogVLM. We empirically find that directly LoRA fine-tuning of this VLM for the HPE task fails to achieve desirable HPE accuracy, while some model merging methods can improve accuracy but frequently produce blended invalid response formats, struggling to handle both object detection and HPE tasks simultaneously. To integrate HPE capability into CogVLM effectively, we develop a novel LoRA layer-based model merging method. This merging approach applies a high cosine similarity threshold and a winner-takes-all layer selection strategy, aligning attention to the HPE task while preserving original object detection knowledge. It successfully resolves issues with blended invalid response formats and improves accuracy. Results show that our HPE-CogVLM achieves a 31.5\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error over the current state-of-the-art CNN model, 6DRepNet, in cross-dataset evaluation. Furthermore, HPE-CogVLM outperforms both directly LoRA fine-tuned and task arithmetic-based merged VLMs across all HPE metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: A comprehensive benchmark is yet to be established in the Image Manipulation Detection & Localization (IMDL) field. The absence of such a benchmark leads to insufficient and misleading model evaluations, severely undermining the development of this field. However, the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and inconsistent training and evaluation protocols make conducting rigorous experiments and faithful comparisons among IMDL models challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce IMDL-BenCo, the first comprehensive IMDL benchmark and modular codebase. IMDL-BenCo: i) decomposes the IMDL framework into standardized, reusable components and revises the model construction pipeline, improving coding efficiency and customization flexibility; ii) fully implements or incorporates training code for state-of-the-art models to establish a comprehensive IMDL benchmark; and iii) conducts deep analysis based on the established benchmark and codebase, offering new insights into IMDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards. Specifically, IMDL-BenCo includes common processing algorithms, 8 state-of-the-art IMDL models (1 of which are reproduced from scratch), 2 sets of standard training and evaluation protocols, 15 GPU-accelerated evaluation metrics, and 3 kinds of robustness evaluation. This benchmark and codebase represent a significant leap forward in calibrating the current progress in the IMDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.

<p>Abstract: Limited accessibility to neurological care leads to underdiagnosed Parkinson's Disease (PD), preventing early intervention. Existing AI-based PD detection methods primarily focus on unimodal analysis of motor or speech tasks, overlooking the multifaceted nature of the disease. To address this, we introduce a large-scale, multi-task video dataset consisting of 1102 sessions (each containing videos of finger tapping, facial expression, and speech tasks captured via webcam) from 845 participants (272 with PD). We propose a novel Uncertainty-calibrated Fusion Network (UFNet) that leverages this multimodal data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. UFNet employs independent task-specific networks, trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification, followed by self-attended fusion of features, with attention weights dynamically adjusted based on task-specific uncertainties. To ensure patient-centered evaluation, the participants were randomly split into three sets: 60% for training, 20% for model selection, and 20% for final performance evaluation. UFNet significantly outperformed single-task models in terms of accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and sensitivity while maintaining non-inferior specificity. Withholding uncertain predictions further boosted the performance, achieving 88.0+-0.3%$ accuracy, 93.0+-0.2% AUROC, 79.3+-0.9% sensitivity, and 92.6+-0.3% specificity, at the expense of not being able to predict for 2.3+-0.3% data (+- denotes 95% confidence interval). Further analysis suggests that the trained model does not exhibit any detectable bias across sex and ethnic subgroups and is most effective for individuals aged between 50 and 80. Requiring only a webcam and microphone, our approach facilitates accessible home-based PD screening, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuming Zhang, Shouxin Zhang, Peizhe Wang, Feiyu Zhu, Dongzhi Guan, Junhao Su, Jiabin Liu, Changpeng Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) typically employ an end-to-end (E2E) training paradigm which presents several challenges, including high GPU memory consumption, inefficiency, and difficulties in model parallelization during training. Recent research has sought to address these issues, with one promising approach being local learning. This method involves partitioning the backbone network into gradient-isolated modules and manually designing auxiliary networks to train these local modules. Existing methods often neglect the interaction of information between local modules, leading to myopic issues and a performance gap compared to E2E training. To address these limitations, we propose the Multilaminar Leap Augmented Auxiliary Network (MLAAN). Specifically, MLAAN comprises Multilaminar Local Modules (MLM) and Leap Augmented Modules (LAM). MLM captures both local and global features through independent and cascaded auxiliary networks, alleviating performance issues caused by insufficient global features. However, overly simplistic auxiliary networks can impede MLM's ability to capture global information. To address this, we further design LAM, an enhanced auxiliary network that uses the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) method to facilitate information exchange between local modules, thereby mitigating the shortsightedness resulting from inadequate interaction. The synergy between MLM and LAM has demonstrated excellent performance. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10, STL-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets show that MLAAN can be seamlessly integrated into existing local learning frameworks, significantly enhancing their performance and even surpassing end-to-end (E2E) training methods, while also reducing GPU memory consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Jing, Anhong Wang, Lijun Zhao, Yakun Yang, Donghan Bu, Jing Zhang, Yifan Zhang, Junhui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, LiDAR sensors are vital for acquiring 3D point clouds, providing reliable geometric information. However, traditional sampling methods of preprocessing often ignore semantic features, leading to detail loss and ground point interference in 3D object detection. To address this, we propose a multi-branch two-stage 3D object detection framework using a Semantic-aware Multi-branch Sampling (SMS) module and multi-view consistency constraints. The SMS module includes random sampling, Density Equalization Sampling (DES) for enhancing distant objects, and Ground Abandonment Sampling (GAS) to focus on non-ground points. The sampled multi-view points are processed through a Consistent KeyPoint Selection (CKPS) module to generate consistent keypoint masks for efficient proposal sampling. The first-stage detector uses multi-branch parallel learning with multi-view consistency loss for feature aggregation, while the second-stage detector fuses multi-view data through a Multi-View Fusion Pooling (MVFP) module to precisely predict 3D objects. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset show that our method achieves excellent detection performance improvement for a variety of backbones, especially for low-performance backbones with the simple network structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we formulate the task of Video Anomaly Detection as a probabilistic analysis of object bounding boxes. We hypothesize that the representation of objects via their bounding boxes only, can be sufficient to successfully identify anomalous events in a scene. The implied value of this approach is increased object anonymization, faster model training and fewer computational resources. This can particularly benefit applications within video surveillance running on edge devices such as cameras. We design our model based on human reasoning which lends itself to explaining model output in human-understandable terms. Meanwhile, the slowest model trains within less than 7 seconds on a 11th Generation Intel Core i9 Processor. While our approach constitutes a drastic reduction of problem feature space in comparison with prior art, we show that this does not result in a reduction in performance: the results we report are highly competitive on the benchmark datasets CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech, and significantly exceed on the latest State-of-the-Art results on StreetScene, which has so far proven to be the most challenging VAD dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models are being increasingly adopted in diverse global communities where they create visual representations of their unique cultures. Current T2I benchmarks primarily focus on faithfulness, aesthetics, and realism of generated images, overlooking the critical dimension of cultural competence. In this work, we introduce a framework to evaluate cultural competence of T2I models along two crucial dimensions: cultural awareness and cultural diversity, and present a scalable approach using a combination of structured knowledge bases and large language models to build a large dataset of cultural artifacts to enable this evaluation. In particular, we apply this approach to build CUBE (CUltural BEnchmark for Text-to-Image models), a first-of-its-kind benchmark to evaluate cultural competence of T2I models. CUBE covers cultural artifacts associated with 8 countries across different geo-cultural regions and along 3 concepts: cuisine, landmarks, and art. CUBE consists of 1) CUBE-1K, a set of high-quality prompts that enable the evaluation of cultural awareness, and 2) CUBE-CSpace, a larger dataset of cultural artifacts that serves as grounding to evaluate cultural diversity. We also introduce cultural diversity as a novel T2I evaluation component, leveraging quality-weighted Vendi score. Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the cultural awareness of existing models across countries and provide valuable insights into the cultural diversity of T2I outputs for under-specified prompts. Our methodology is extendable to other cultural regions and concepts, and can facilitate the development of T2I models that better cater to the global population.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Wong, Mun Yong Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a preferred method for gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) classification without requiring patch-level annotations. Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset. Additionally, prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models and using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We believe these insights provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective foundation models. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MIL-Feature-Extractor-Selection</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Fotopoulos, Petros Maragos, Panagiotis Misiakos</p>
<p>Abstract: We present TropNNC, a framework for compressing neural networks with linear and convolutional layers and ReLU activations. TropNNC is a structured compression framework based on a geometrical approach to machine/deep learning, using tropical geometry and extending the work of Misiakos et al. (2022). We use the Hausdorff distance of zonotopes in its standard continuous form to achieve a tighter approximation bound for tropical polynomials compared to previous work. This enhancement leads to the development of an effective compression algorithm that achieves superior functional approximations of neural networks. Our method is significantly easier to implement compared to other frameworks, and does not depend on the availability of training data samples. We validate our framework through extensive empirical evaluations on the MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets. Our results demonstrate that TropNNC achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods like ThiNet (even surpassing it in compressing linear layers) and CUP. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method that achieves this using tropical geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lalith Bharadwaj Baru, Shilhora Akshay Patel, Rohit Boddeda</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of digital image manipulation, particularly with the advancement of deep generative models, significantly challenges existing deepfake detection methods, especially when the origin of the deepfake is obscure. To tackle the increasing complexity of these forgeries, we propose \textbf{Wavelet-CLIP}, a deepfake detection framework that integrates wavelet transforms with features derived from the ViT-L/14 architecture, pre-trained in the CLIP fashion. Wavelet-CLIP utilizes Wavelet Transforms to deeply analyze both spatial and frequency features from images, thus enhancing the model's capability to detect sophisticated deepfakes. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations against existing state-of-the-art methods for cross-dataset generalization and detection of unseen images generated by standard diffusion models. Our method showcases outstanding performance, achieving an average AUC of 0.749 for cross-data generalization and 0.893 for robustness against unseen deepfakes, outperforming all compared methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chieh-Yun Chen, Chiang Tseng, Li-Wu Tsao, Hong-Han Shuai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of causal manner in the text encoder of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which can lead to information bias and loss. Previous works have focused on addressing the issues through the denoising process. However, there is no research discussing how text embedding contributes to T2I models, especially when generating more than one object. In this paper, we share a comprehensive analysis of text embedding: i) how text embedding contributes to the generated images and ii) why information gets lost and biases towards the first-mentioned object. Accordingly, we propose a simple but effective text embedding balance optimization method, which is training-free, with an improvement of 125.42% on information balance in stable diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric that quantifies information loss more accurately than existing methods, achieving 81% concordance with human assessments. This metric effectively measures the presence and accuracy of objects, addressing the limitations of current distribution scores like CLIP's text-image similarities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahang Cao, Mingyuan Sun, Ziqing Wang, Hao Cheng, Qiang Zhang, Shibo Zhou, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based cameras are attracting significant interest as they provide rich edge information, high dynamic range, and high temporal resolution. Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into fixed groups, resulting in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (\eg, high/low speed).In this work, we propose SpikeSlicer, a novel-designed plug-and-play event processing method capable of splitting events stream adaptively.SpikeSlicer utilizes a low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) to trigger event slicing. To guide the SNN to fire spikes at optimal time steps, we propose the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) to modulate the neuron's state. Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Hosseini Chagahi, Saeed Mohammadi Dashtaki, Niloufar Delfan, Nadia Mohammadi, Alireza Samari, Behzad Moshiri, Md. Jalil Piran, Oliver Faust</p>
<p>Abstract: Osteoporosis is a common condition that increases fracture risk, especially in older adults. Early diagnosis is vital for preventing fractures, reducing treatment costs, and preserving mobility. However, healthcare providers face challenges like limited labeled data and difficulties in processing medical images. This study presents a novel multi-modal learning framework that integrates clinical and imaging data to improve diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability. The model utilizes three pre-trained networks-VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet50-to extract deep features from X-ray images. These features are transformed using PCA to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant components. A clustering-based selection process identifies the most representative components, which are then combined with preprocessed clinical data and processed through a fully connected network (FCN) for final classification. A feature importance plot highlights key variables, showing that Medical History, BMI, and Height were the main contributors, emphasizing the significance of patient-specific data. While imaging features were valuable, they had lower importance, indicating that clinical data are crucial for accurate predictions. This framework promotes precise and interpretable predictions, enhancing transparency and building trust in AI-driven diagnoses for clinical integration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems require more than simply seeing, via e.g., object detection or scene segmentation. They need a holistic understanding of what is happening within the scene for safe interaction with other road users. Few datasets exist for the purpose of developing and training algorithms to comprehend the actions of other road users. This paper presents ROAD-Waymo, an extensive dataset for the development and benchmarking of techniques for agent, action, location and event detection in road scenes, provided as a layer upon the (US) Waymo Open dataset. Considerably larger and more challenging than any existing dataset (and encompassing multiple cities), it comes with 198k annotated video frames, 54k agent tubes, 3.9M bounding boxes and a total of 12.4M labels. The integrity of the dataset has been confirmed and enhanced via a novel annotation pipeline designed for automatically identifying violations of requirements specifically designed for this dataset. As ROAD-Waymo is compatible with the original (UK) ROAD dataset, it provides the opportunity to tackle domain adaptation between real-world road scenarios in different countries within a novel benchmark: ROAD++.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwon Kim, Seoyeon Kim, Suha Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-centric learning (OCL) aims to learn representations of individual objects within visual scenes without manual supervision, facilitating efficient and effective visual reasoning. Traditional OCL methods primarily employ bottom-up approaches that aggregate homogeneous visual features to represent objects. However, in complex visual environments, these methods often fall short due to the heterogeneous nature of visual features within an object. To address this, we propose a novel OCL framework incorporating a top-down pathway. This pathway first bootstraps the semantics of individual objects and then modulates the model to prioritize features relevant to these semantics. By dynamically modulating the model based on its own output, our top-down pathway enhances the representational quality of objects. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world object-discovery benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoliang Liu, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jilan Mei, Junbo Li, Cai Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laiyan Ding, Hualie Jiang, Rui Xu, Rui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth completion using lightweight time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors is attractive due to their low cost. However, lightweight ToF sensors usually have a limited field of view (FOV) compared with cameras. Thus, only pixels in the zone area of the image can be associated with depth signals. Previous methods fail to propagate depth features from the zone area to the outside-zone area effectively, thus suffering from degraded depth completion performance outside the zone. To this end, this paper proposes the CFPNet to achieve cross-zone feature propagation from the zone area to the outside-zone area with two novel modules. The first is a direct-attention-based propagation module (DAPM), which enforces direct cross-zone feature acquisition. The second is a large-kernel-based propagation module (LKPM), which realizes cross-zone feature propagation by utilizing convolution layers with kernel sizes up to 31. CFPNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth completion performance by combining these two modules properly, as verified by extensive experimental results on the ZJU-L5 dataset. The code will be made public.</p>

Fortunately, the field of explainability helps users understand these results. This aspect of machine learning allows users to grasp the decision-making process of a model and verify the relevance of its outcomes.

<p>Abstract: Facade semantic segmentation is a long-standing challenge in photogrammetry and computer vision. Although the last decades have witnessed the influx of facade segmentation methods, there is a lack of comprehensive facade classes and data covering the architectural variability. In ZAHA, we introduce Level of Facade Generalization (LoFG), novel hierarchical facade classes designed based on international urban modeling standards, ensuring compatibility with real-world challenging classes and uniform methods' comparison. Realizing the LoFG, we present to date the largest semantic 3D facade segmentation dataset, providing 601 million annotated points at five and 15 classes of LoFG2 and LoFG3, respectively. Moreover, we analyze the performance of baseline semantic segmentation methods on our introduced LoFG classes and data, complementing it with a discussion on the unresolved challenges for facade segmentation. We firmly believe that ZAHA shall facilitate further development of 3D facade semantic segmentation methods, enabling robust segmentation indispensable in creating urban digital twins.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging task that involves answering questions based on both auditory and visual information in videos. A significant challenge is interpreting complex multi-modal scenes, which include both visual objects and sound sources, and connecting them to the given question. In this paper, we introduce the Source-aware Semantic Representation Network (SaSR-Net), a novel model designed for AVQA. SaSR-Net utilizes source-wise learnable tokens to efficiently capture and align audio-visual elements with the corresponding question. It streamlines the fusion of audio and visual information using spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to identify answers in multi-modal scenes. Extensive experiments on the Music-AVQA and AVQA-Yang datasets show that SaSR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art AVQA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyang Li, Yujun Lin, Zhekai Zhang, Tianle Cai, Xiuyu Li, Junxian Guo, Enze Xie, Chenlin Meng, Jun-Yan Zhu, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been proven highly effective at generating high-quality images. However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more memory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for deployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training quantization methods for large language models like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, na\"{\i}vely running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs. Our quantization library and inference engine are open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taaha Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image compression is a widely studied field of data processing due to its prevalence in modern digital databases. This domain requires a high color depth of 12 bits per pixel component for accurate analysis by physicians, primarily in the DICOM format. Standard raster-based compression of images via filtering is well-known; however, it remains suboptimal in the medical domain due to non-specialized implementations. This study proposes a lossless medical image compression algorithm, CompaCT, that aims to target spatial features and patterns of pixel concentration for dynamically enhanced data processing. The algorithm employs fractal pixel traversal coupled with a novel approach of segmentation and meshing between pixel blocks for preprocessing. Furthermore, delta and entropy coding are applied to this concept for a complete compression pipeline. The proposal demonstrates that the data compression achieved via fractal segmentation preprocessing yields enhanced image compression results while remaining lossless in its reconstruction accuracy. CompaCT is evaluated in its compression ratios on 3954 high-color CT scans against the efficiency of industry-standard compression techniques (i.e., JPEG2000, RLE, ZIP, PNG). Its reconstruction performance is assessed with error metrics to verify lossless image recovery after decompression. The results demonstrate that CompaCT can compress and losslessly reconstruct medical images, being 37% more space-efficient than industry-standard compression systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Ruan, Jincheng Li, Suncheng Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of medical image segmentation, both CNN-based and Transformer-based models have been extensively explored. However, CNNs exhibit limitations in long-range modeling capabilities, whereas Transformers are hampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, have emerged as a promising approach. They not only excel in modeling long-range interactions but also maintain a linear computational complexity. In this paper, leveraging state space models, we propose a U-shape architecture model for medical image segmentation, named Vision Mamba UNet (VM-UNet). Specifically, the Visual State Space (VSS) block is introduced as the foundation block to capture extensive contextual information, and an asymmetrical encoder-decoder structure is constructed with fewer convolution layers to save calculation cost. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, and Synapse datasets, and the results indicate that VM-UNet performs competitively in medical image segmentation tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first medical image segmentation model constructed based on the pure SSM-based model. We aim to establish a baseline and provide valuable insights for the future development of more efficient and effective SSM-based segmentation systems.

<p>Abstract: Natural language is often the easiest and most convenient modality for humans to specify tasks for robots. However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Rouditchenko, Yuan Gong, Samuel Thomas, Leonid Karlinsky, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) uses lip-based video to improve performance in noise. Since videos are harder to obtain than audio, the video training data of AVSR models is usually limited to a few thousand hours. In contrast, speech models such as Whisper are trained with hundreds of thousands of hours of data, and thus learn a better speech-to-text decoder. The huge training data difference motivates us to adapt Whisper to handle video inputs. Inspired by Flamingo which injects visual features into language models, we propose Whisper-Flamingo which integrates visual features into the Whisper speech recognition and translation model with gated cross attention. Our models achieve state-of-the-art ASR WER (0.68%) and AVSR WER (0.76%) on LRS3. Audio-visual Whisper-Flamingo outperforms audio-only Whisper on English speech recognition and En-X translation for 6 languages in noisy conditions. Moreover, Whisper-Flamingo is versatile and conducts all of these tasks using one set of parameters, while prior methods are trained separately on each language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pandiyaraju V, Shravan Venkatraman, Abeshek A, Aravintakshan S A, Pavan Kumar S, Kannan A</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegeneration, which impacts millions of people each year. Diagnosing and classifying AD accurately with neuroimaging data is an ongoing challenge in the field of medicine. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are good at capturing low-level information from images, but their capability to extract high-level minuscule particles is suboptimal, which is a significant challenge in detecting AD from MRI scans. To overcome this, we propose a novel Granular Feature Integration method to combine information extraction at different scales combined with an efficient information flow. We also propose a Bi-Focal Perspective mechanism to highlight focus on subtle neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in MRI scans. Our model yielded an F1-Score of 99.31%, a precision of 99.24%, and a recall of 99.51%, which shows a major improvement in comparison to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17791">Untrained neural networks can demonstrate memorization-independent abstract reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Barak, Yonatan Loewenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The nature of abstract reasoning is a matter of debate. Modern artificial neural network (ANN) models, like large language models, demonstrate impressive success when tested on abstract reasoning problems. However, it has been argued that their success reflects some form of memorization of similar problems (data contamination) rather than a general-purpose abstract reasoning capability. This concern is supported by evidence of brittleness, and the requirement of extensive training. In our study, we explored whether abstract reasoning can be achieved using the toolbox of ANNs, without prior training. Specifically, we studied an ANN model in which the weights of a naive network are optimized during the solution of the problem, using the problem data itself, rather than any prior knowledge. We tested this modeling approach on visual reasoning problems and found that it performs relatively well. Crucially, this success does not rely on memorization of similar problems. We further suggest an explanation of how it works. Finally, as problem solving is performed by changing the ANN weights, we explored the connection between problem solving and the accumulation of knowledge in the ANNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Christie, Matan Leibovich, Miguel Moscoso, Alexei Novikov, George Papanicolaou, Chrysoula Tsogka</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a methodology that exploits large and diverse data sets to accurately estimate the ambient medium's Green's functions in strongly scattering media. Given these estimates, obtained with and without the use of neural networks, excellent imaging results are achieved, with a resolution that is better than that of a homogeneous medium. This phenomenon, also known as super-resolution, occurs because the ambient scattering medium effectively enhances the physical imaging aperture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arianna Bunnell, Dustin Valdez, Thomas K. Wolfgruber, Brandon Quon, Kailee Hung, Brenda Y. Hernandez, Todd B. Seto, Jeffrey Killeen, Marshall Miyoshi, Peter Sadowski, John A. Shepherd</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Breast density, as derived from mammographic images and defined by the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an alternative breast cancer screening modality, particularly useful for early detection in low-resource, rural contexts. The purpose of this study was to explore an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict BI-RADS mammographic breast density category from clinical, handheld BUS imaging. Methods: All data are sourced from the Hawaii and Pacific Islands Mammography Registry. We compared deep learning methods from BUS imaging, as well as machine learning models from image statistics alone. The use of AI-derived BUS density as a risk factor for breast cancer was then compared to clinical BI-RADS breast density while adjusting for age. The BUS data were split by individual into 70/20/10% groups for training, validation, and testing. Results: 405,120 clinical BUS images from 14.066 women were selected for inclusion in this study, resulting in 9.846 women for training (302,574 images), 2,813 for validation (11,223 images), and 1,406 for testing (4,042 images). On the held-out testing set, the strongest AI model achieves AUROC 0.854 predicting BI-RADS mammographic breast density from BUS imaging and outperforms all shallow machine learning methods based on image statistics. In cancer risk prediction, age-adjusted AI BUS breast density predicted 5-year breast cancer risk with 0.633 AUROC, as compared to 0.637 AUROC from age-adjusted clinical breast density. Conclusions: BI-RADS mammographic breast density can be estimated from BUS imaging with high accuracy using a deep learning model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AI-derived BUS breast density is predictive of 5-year breast cancer risk in our population.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Kaniewski, Fariba Yousefi, Yeman Brhane Hagos, Talha Qaiser, Nikolay Burlutskiy</p>
<p>Abstract: In drug discovery, accurate lung tumor segmentation is an important step for assessing tumor size and its progression using \textit{in-vivo} imaging such as MRI. While deep learning models have been developed to automate this process, the focus has predominantly been on human subjects, neglecting the pivotal role of animal models in pre-clinical drug development. In this work, we focus on optimizing lung tumor segmentation in mice. First, we demonstrate that the nnU-Net model outperforms the U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepMeta models. Most importantly, we achieve better results with nnU-Net 3D models than 2D models, indicating the importance of spatial context for segmentation tasks in MRI mice scans. This study demonstrates the importance of 3D input over 2D input images for lung tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Finally, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art approach that involves the combined segmentation of lungs and tumors within the lungs. Our work achieves comparable results using only lung tumor annotations requiring fewer annotations, saving time and annotation efforts. This work (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/lung-tumour-mice-mri-64BB) is an important step in automating pre-clinical animal studies to quantify the efficacy of experimental drugs, particularly in assessing tumor changes.</p>
