<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Hui, Zhaoxiao Guo, Hang Zhao, Juanyong Duan, Lin Ai, Yinheng Li, Julia Hirschberg, Congrui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality, diverse harmful data is essential to addressing real-time applications in content moderation. Current state-of-the-art approaches to toxic content detection using GPT series models are costly and lack explainability. This paper investigates the use of prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques on open-source LLMs to enhance harmful data augmentation specifically for toxic content detection. We conduct a two-stage empirical study, with stage 1 evaluating six open-source LLMs across multiple datasets using only prompt engineering and stage 2 focusing on fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that Mistral can excel in generating harmful data with minimal hallucination. While fine-tuning these models improves data quality and diversity, challenges such as data duplication and overfitting persist. Our experimental results highlight scalable, cost-effective strategies for enhancing toxic content detection systems. These findings not only demonstrate the potential of open-source LLMs in creating robust content moderation tools. The application of this method in real industrial scenarios further proves the feasibility and efficiency of the fine-tuned open-source LLMs for data augmentation. We hope our study will aid in understanding the capabilities and limitations of current models in toxic content detection and drive further advancements in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junliang Du, Guiran Liu, Jia Gao, Xiaoxuan Liao, Jiacheng Hu, Linxiao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposed a knowledge graph entity extraction and relationship reasoning algorithm based on a graph neural network, using a graph convolutional network and graph attention network to model the complex structure in the knowledge graph. By building an end-to-end joint model, this paper achieves efficient recognition and reasoning of entities and relationships. In the experiment, this paper compared the model with a variety of deep learning algorithms and verified its superiority through indicators such as AUC, recall rate, precision rate, and F1 value. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper performs well in all indicators, especially in complex knowledge graphs, it has stronger generalization ability and stability. This provides strong support for further research on knowledge graphs and also demonstrates the application potential of graph neural networks in entity extraction and relationship reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Rafsan Kabir, Md. Mohibur Rahman Nabil, Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentence-level embedding is essential for various tasks that require understanding natural language. Many studies have explored such embeddings for high-resource languages like English. However, low-resource languages like Bengali (a language spoken by almost two hundred and thirty million people) are still under-explored. This work introduces two lightweight sentence transformers for the Bangla language, leveraging a novel cross-lingual knowledge distillation approach. This method distills knowledge from a pre-trained, high-performing English sentence transformer. Proposed models are evaluated across multiple downstream tasks, including paraphrase detection, semantic textual similarity (STS), and Bangla hate speech detection. The new method consistently outperformed existing Bangla sentence transformers. Moreover, the lightweight architecture and shorter inference time make the models highly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments, making them valuable for practical NLP applications in low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars Malmqvist</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their tendency to exhibit sycophantic behavior - excessively agreeing with or flattering users - poses significant risks to their reliability and ethical deployment. This paper provides a technical survey of sycophancy in LLMs, analyzing its causes, impacts, and potential mitigation strategies. We review recent work on measuring and quantifying sycophantic tendencies, examine the relationship between sycophancy and other challenges like hallucination and bias, and evaluate promising techniques for reducing sycophancy while maintaining model performance. Key approaches explored include improved training data, novel fine-tuning methods, post-deployment control mechanisms, and decoding strategies. We also discuss the broader implications of sycophancy for AI alignment and propose directions for future research. Our analysis suggests that mitigating sycophancy is crucial for developing more robust, reliable, and ethically-aligned language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gerald Friedland, Xin Huang, Yueying Cui, Vishaal Kapoor, Ashish Khetan, Sanjiv Das</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose PPLqa, an easy to compute, language independent, information-theoretic metric to measure the quality of responses of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) in an unsupervised way, without requiring ground truth annotations or human supervision. The method and metric enables users to rank generative language models for quality of responses, so as to make a selection of the best model for a given task. Our single metric assesses LLMs with an approach that subsumes, but is not explicitly based on, coherence and fluency (quality of writing) and relevance and consistency (appropriateness of response) to the query. PPLqa performs as well as other related metrics, and works better with long-form Q\&A. Thus, PPLqa enables bypassing the lengthy annotation process required for ground truth evaluations, and it also correlates well with human and LLM rankings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mostafa Varzaneh, Pooja Voladoddi, Tanmay Bakshi, Uma Gunturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time conversational AI agents face challenges in performing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in dynamic, outdoor environments like automated drive-thru systems. These settings require NLU models to handle background noise, diverse accents, and multi-intent queries while operating under strict latency and memory constraints on edge devices. Additionally, robustness to errors from upstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is crucial, as ASR outputs in these environments are often noisy. We introduce Babylon, a transformer-based architecture that tackles NLU as an intent translation task, converting natural language inputs into sequences of regular language units ('transcodes') that encode both intents and slot information. This formulation allows Babylon to manage multi-intent scenarios in a single dialogue turn. Furthermore, Babylon incorporates an LSTM-based token pooling mechanism to preprocess phoneme sequences, reducing input length and optimizing for low-latency, low-memory edge deployment. This also helps mitigate inaccuracies in ASR outputs, enhancing system robustness. While this work focuses on drive-thru ordering, Babylon's design extends to similar noise-prone scenarios, for e.g. ticketing kiosks. Our experiments show that Babylon achieves significantly better accuracy-latency-memory footprint trade-offs over typically employed NMT models like Flan-T5 and BART, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time NLU in edge deployment settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elita Lobo, Chirag Agarwal, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful tools for general intelligence, showcasing advanced natural language processing capabilities that find applications across diverse domains. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted the potential for significant enhancements in LLMs' task-specific performance through fine-tuning strategies like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (Q-LoRA) method. However, previous works have shown that while fine-tuning offers significant performance gains, it also leads to challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and privacy and safety risks. To this end, there has been little to no work in \textit{understanding the impact of fine-tuning on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs}. Our research investigates the effect of fine-tuning on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, addressing critical questions regarding the impact of task-specific fine-tuning on overall reasoning capabilities, the influence of fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning performance, and the implications for the faithfulness of CoT reasonings. By exploring these dimensions, our study shows the impact of fine-tuning on LLM reasoning capabilities, where the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, on average across four datasets, decreases, highlighting potential shifts in internal mechanisms of the LLMs resulting from fine-tuning processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mara Finkelstein, Dan Deutsch, Parker Riley, Juraj Juraska, Geza Kovacs, Markus Freitag</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs continue to become more powerful and versatile, human evaluation has quickly become intractable at scale and reliance on automatic metrics has become the norm. Recently, it has been shown that LLMs are themselves state-of-the-art evaluators for many tasks. These Autoraters are typically designed so that they generalize to new systems and test sets. In practice, however, evaluation is performed on a small set of fixed, canonical test sets, which are carefully curated to measure certain capabilities of interest and are not changed frequently. In this work, we design a method which specializes a prompted Autorater to a given test set, by leveraging historical ratings on the test set to construct in-context learning (ICL) examples. We evaluate our Specialist method on the task of fine-grained machine translation evaluation, and show that it dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art XCOMET metric by 54% and 119% on the WMT'23 and WMT'24 test sets, respectively. We perform extensive analyses to understand the representations learned by our Specialist metrics, and how variability in rater behavior affects their performance. We also verify the generalizability and robustness of our Specialist method for designing automatic metrics across different numbers of ICL examples, LLM backbones, systems to evaluate, and evaluation tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15405">ML-SPEAK: A Theory-Guided Machine Learning Method for Studying and Predicting Conversational Turn-taking Patterns</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa R. O'Bryan, Madeline Navarro, Juan Segundo Hevia, Santiago Segarra</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting team dynamics from personality traits remains a fundamental challenge for the psychological sciences and team-based organizations. Understanding how team composition generates team processes can significantly advance team-based research along with providing practical guidelines for team staffing and training. Although the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model has been useful for studying these connections, the complex nature of team member interactions demands a more dynamic approach. We develop a computational model of conversational turn-taking within self-organized teams that can provide insight into the relationships between team member personality traits and team communication dynamics. We focus on turn-taking patterns between team members, independent of content, which can significantly influence team emergent states and outcomes while being objectively measurable and quantifiable. As our model is trained on conversational data from teams of given trait compositions, it can learn the relationships between individual traits and speaking behaviors and predict group-wide patterns of communication based on team trait composition alone. We first evaluate the performance of our model using simulated data and then apply it to real-world data collected from self-organized student teams. In comparison to baselines, our model is more accurate at predicting speaking turn sequences and can reveal new relationships between team member traits and their communication patterns. Our approach offers a more data-driven and dynamic understanding of team processes. By bridging the gap between individual personality traits and team communication patterns, our model has the potential to inform theories of team processes and provide powerful insights into optimizing team staffing and training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shezheng Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) aims to extract aspect terms and their corresponding sentiment polarities from multimodal information, including text and images. While traditional supervised learning methods have shown effectiveness in this task, the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to MABSA remains uncertain. Recent advances in LLMs, such as Llama2, LLaVA, and ChatGPT, demonstrate strong capabilities in general tasks, yet their performance in complex and fine-grained scenarios like MABSA is underexplored. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the suitability of LLMs for MABSA. To this end, we construct a benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on MABSA tasks and compare them with state-of-the-art supervised learning methods. Our experiments reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate potential in multimodal understanding, they face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory results for MABSA, particularly in terms of accuracy and inference time. Based on these findings, we discuss the limitations of current LLMs and outline directions for future research to enhance their capabilities in multimodal sentiment analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhou Chen, Chengyu Wang, Dakan Wang, Taolin Zhang, Wangyue Li, Xiaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Model editing aims to correct inaccurate knowledge, update outdated information, and incorporate new data into Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications. While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs, Vision LLMs (VLLMs), which incorporate an additional vision modality, are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors. In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a LIfelong Vision language modEl Edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios. Further experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of each module design in LiveEdit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Chen, Chen Wu, Shaoqun Zhang, Nan Li, Liangjie Zhang, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding models have become essential tools in both natural language processing and computer vision, enabling efficient semantic search, recommendation, clustering, and more. However, the high memory and computational demands of full-precision embeddings pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as real-time recommendation systems. In this work, we propose a novel finetuning framework to ternary-weight embedding models, which reduces memory and computational overhead while maintaining high performance. To apply ternarization to pre-trained embedding models, we introduce self-taught knowledge distillation to finalize the ternary-weights of the linear layers. With extensive experiments on public text and vision datasets, we demonstrated that without sacrificing effectiveness, the ternarized model consumes low memory usage and has low latency in the inference stage with great efficiency. In practical implementations, embedding models are typically integrated with Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. Our experiments combining ternary embedding with ANN search yielded impressive improvement in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The repository is available at here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Tonneau, Diyi Liu, Niyati Malhotra, Scott A. Hale, Samuel P. Fraiberger, Victor Orozco-Olvera, Paul R\"ottger</p>
<p>Abstract: To tackle the global challenge of online hate speech, a large body of research has developed detection models to flag hate speech in the sea of online content. Yet, due to systematic biases in evaluation datasets, detection performance in real-world settings remains unclear, let alone across geographies. To address this issue, we introduce HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media settings, randomly sampled from all tweets posted on September 21, 2022 for eight languages and four English-speaking countries. Using HateDay, we show how the prevalence and composition of hate speech varies across languages and countries. We also find that evaluation on academic hate speech datasets overestimates real-world detection performance, which we find is very low, especially for non-European languages. We identify several factors explaining poor performance, including models' inability to distinguish between hate and offensive speech, and the misalignment between academic target focus and real-world target prevalence. We finally argue that such low performance renders hate speech moderation with public detection models unfeasible, even in a human-in-the-loop setting which we find is prohibitively costly. Overall, we emphasize the need to evaluate future detection models from academia and platforms in real-world settings to address this global challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Joshi, Shaswati Saha, Divyaksh Shukla, Sriram Vema, Harsh Jhamtani, Manas Gaur, Ashutosh Modi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be a great success in a wide range of applications ranging from regular NLP-based use cases to AI agents. LLMs have been trained on a vast corpus of texts from various sources; despite the best efforts during the data pre-processing stage while training the LLMs, they may pick some undesirable information such as personally identifiable information (PII). Consequently, in recent times research in the area of Machine Unlearning (MUL) has become active, the main idea is to force LLMs to forget (unlearn) certain information (e.g., PII) without suffering from performance loss on regular tasks. In this work, we examine the robustness of the existing MUL techniques for their ability to enable leakage-proof forgetting in LLMs. In particular, we examine the effect of data transformation on forgetting, i.e., is an unlearned LLM able to recall forgotten information if there is a change in the format of the input? Our findings on the TOFU dataset highlight the necessity of using diverse data formats to quantify unlearning in LLMs more reliably.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a synthetic data approach for instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages in a data-efficient manner, specifically focusing on Thai. We identify three key properties that contribute to the effectiveness of instruction-tuning datasets: fluency, diversity, and cultural context. We propose a seed-data-free framework for generating synthetic instruction-tuning data that incorporates these essential properties. Our framework employs an LLM to generate diverse topics, retrieve relevant contexts from Wikipedia, and create instructions for various tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and conversation. The experimental results show that our best-performing synthetic dataset, which incorporates all three key properties, achieves competitive performance using only 5,000 instructions when compared to state-of-the-art Thai LLMs trained on hundreds of thousands of instructions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong-Cheng Tu, Zi-Ao Ma, Tian Lan, Yuehao Zhao, Heyan Huang, Xian-Ling Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Driven by the remarkable progress in diffusion models, text-to-image generation has made significant strides, creating a pressing demand for automatic quality evaluation of generated images. Current state-of-the-art automatic evaluation methods heavily rely on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly powerful commercial models like GPT-4o. While these models are highly effective, their substantial costs limit scalability in large-scale evaluations. Adopting open-source MLLMs is an alternative; however, their performance falls short due to significant limitations in processing multi-modal data compared to commercial MLLMs. To tackle these problems, we first propose a task decomposition evaluation framework based on GPT-4o to automatically construct a new training dataset, where the complex evaluation task is decoupled into simpler sub-tasks, effectively reducing the learning complexity. Based on this dataset, we design innovative training strategies to effectively distill GPT-4o's evaluation capabilities into a 7B open-source MLLM, MiniCPM-V-2.6. Furthermore, to reliably and comprehensively assess prior works and our proposed model, we manually annotate a meta-evaluation benchmark that includes chain-of-thought explanations alongside quality scores for generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled open-source MLLM significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art GPT-4o-base baseline, VIEScore, with over 4.6\% improvement in Spearman and Kendall correlations with human judgments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15523">Enhancing Grammatical Error Detection using BERT with Cleaned Lang-8 Dataset</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Nihalani, Kushal Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an improved LLM based model for Grammatical Error Detection (GED), which is a very challenging and equally important problem for many applications. The traditional approach to GED involved hand-designed features, but recently, Neural Networks (NN) have automated the discovery of these features, improving performance in GED. Traditional rule-based systems have an F1 score of 0.50-0.60 and earlier machine learning models give an F1 score of 0.65-0.75, including decision trees and simple neural networks. Previous deep learning models, for example, Bi-LSTM, have reported F1 scores within the range from 0.80 to 0.90. In our study, we have fine-tuned various transformer models using the Lang8 dataset rigorously cleaned by us. In our experiments, the BERT-base-uncased model gave an impressive performance with an F1 score of 0.91 and accuracy of 98.49% on training data and 90.53% on testing data, also showcasing the importance of data cleaning. Increasing model size using BERT-large-uncased or RoBERTa-large did not give any noticeable improvements in performance or advantage for this task, underscoring that larger models are not always better. Our results clearly show how far rigorous data cleaning and simple transformer-based models can go toward significantly improving the quality of GED.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Kornilov, Tatiana Shavrina</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated significant improvements in zero-shot capabilities, including in-context learning, instruction following, and machine translation for extremely under-resourced languages (Tanzer et al., 2024). However, many languages with limited written resources rely primarily on formal descriptions of grammar and vocabulary.
  In this paper, we introduce a set of benchmarks to evaluate how well models can extract and classify information from the complex descriptions found in linguistic grammars. We present a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approach that leverages these descriptions for downstream tasks such as machine translation. Our benchmarks encompass linguistic descriptions for 248 languages across 142 language families, focusing on typological features from WALS and Grambank.
  This set of benchmarks offers the first comprehensive evaluation of language models' in-context ability to accurately interpret and extract linguistic features, providing a critical resource for scaling NLP to low-resource languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> D. Wiechmann, E. Kempa, E. Kerz, Y. Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent mental health condition affecting both children and adults, yet it remains severely underdiagnosed. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), offer promising solutions for scalable and non-invasive ADHD screening methods using social media data. This paper presents a comprehensive study on ADHD detection, leveraging both shallow machine learning models and deep learning approaches, including BiLSTM and transformer-based models, to analyze linguistic patterns in ADHD-related social media text. Our results highlight the trade-offs between interpretability and performance across different models, with BiLSTM offering a balance of transparency and accuracy. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of these models using cross-platform data from Reddit and Twitter, uncovering key linguistic features associated with ADHD that could contribute to more effective digital screening tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengfei Lan, Lecheng Zheng, Shufan Ming, Halil Kilicoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential sentence classification (SSC) in scientific publications is crucial for supporting downstream tasks such as fine-grained information retrieval and extractive summarization. However, current SSC methods are constrained by model size, sequence length, and single-label setting. To address these limitations, this paper proposes LLM-SSC, a large language model (LLM)-based framework for both single- and multi-label SSC tasks. Unlike previous approaches that employ small- or medium-sized language models, the proposed framework utilizes LLMs to generate SSC labels through designed prompts, which enhance task understanding by incorporating demonstrations and a query to describe the prediction target. We also present a multi-label contrastive learning loss with auto-weighting scheme, enabling the multi-label classification task. To support our multi-label SSC analysis, we introduce and release a new dataset, biorc800, which mainly contains unstructured abstracts in the biomedical domain with manual annotations. Experiments demonstrate LLM-SSC's strong performance in SSC under both in-context learning and task-specific tuning settings. We release biorc800 and our code at: https://github.com/ScienceNLP-Lab/LLM-SSC.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15634">&quot;All that Glitters&quot;: Approaches to Evaluations with Unreliable Model and Human Annotations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Hardy</p>
<p>Abstract: "Gold" and "ground truth" human-mediated labels have error. The effects of this error can escape commonly reported metrics of label quality or obscure questions of accuracy, bias, fairness, and usefulness during model evaluation. This study demonstrates methods for answering such questions even in the context of very low reliabilities from expert humans. We analyze human labels, GPT model ratings, and transformer encoder model annotations describing the quality of classroom teaching, an important, expensive, and currently only human task. We answer the question of whether such a task can be automated using two Large Language Model (LLM) architecture families--encoders and GPT decoders, using novel approaches to evaluating label quality across six dimensions: Concordance, Confidence, Validity, Bias, Fairness, and Helpfulness. First, we demonstrate that using standard metrics in the presence of poor labels can mask both label and model quality: the encoder family of models achieve state-of-the-art, even "super-human", results across all classroom annotation tasks. But not all these positive results remain after using more rigorous evaluation measures which reveal spurious correlations and nonrandom racial biases across models and humans. This study then expands these methods to estimate how model use would change to human label quality if models were used in a human-in-the-loop context, finding that the variance captured in GPT model labels would worsen reliabilities for humans influenced by these models. We identify areas where some LLMs, within the generalizability of the current data, could improve the quality of expensive human ratings of classroom instruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model(LLM) performance on medical multiple choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have stimulated interest from healthcare providers and patients globally. Particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) facing acute physician shortages and lack of specialists, LLMs offer a potentially scalable pathway to enhance healthcare access and reduce costs. However, their effectiveness in the Global South, especially across the African continent, remains to be established. In this work, we introduce AfriMed-QA, the first large scale Pan-African English multi-specialty medical Question-Answering (QA) dataset, 15,000 questions (open and closed-ended) sourced from over 60 medical schools across 16 countries, covering 32 medical specialties. We further evaluate 30 LLMs across multiple axes including correctness and demographic bias. Our findings show significant performance variation across specialties and geographies, MCQ performance clearly lags USMLE (MedQA). We find that biomedical LLMs underperform general models and smaller edge-friendly LLMs struggle to achieve a passing score. Interestingly, human evaluations show a consistent consumer preference for LLM answers and explanations when compared with clinician answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive language models like GPT aim at predicting next tokens, while autoencoding models such as BERT are trained on tasks such as predicting masked tokens. We train a decoder only architecture for predicting the second last token for a sequence of tokens. Our approach yields higher computational training efficiency than BERT-style models by employing a structured deterministic approach towards masking tokens. We use our model to improve the next token predictions of a standard GPT by combining both predictions in a ``generate-then-refine'' approach. We show on different variants of GPT-2 and different datasets that (not unexpectedly) second last token predictions are much more accurate, i.e., more than 15\% higher accuracy than ordinary next token predictors. The ``generate-then-refine'' approach also demonstrates notable improvements in next-token predictions, yielding smaller yet consistent and significant gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaya Mehenni, Amal Zouaq</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for text summarization. However, some domains require specific information to be available in the summaries. Generating these domain-adapted summaries is still an open challenge. Similarly, hallucinations in generated content is a major drawback of current approaches, preventing their deployment. This study proposes a novel approach that leverages ontologies to create domain-adapted summaries both structured and unstructured. We employ an ontology-guided constrained decoding process to reduce hallucinations while improving relevance. When applied to the medical domain, our method shows potential in summarizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across different specialties, allowing doctors to focus on the most relevant information to their domain. Evaluation on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrates improvements in generating domain-adapted summaries of clinical notes and hallucination reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Li, Rui Zhang, Lingzhi Wang, Bin Yu, Youwei Wang, Yuliang Wei, Kai Wang, Richard Yi Da Xu, Bailing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in knowledge graph completion (KGC) has focused on text-based approaches to address the challenges of large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs). Despite their achievements, these methods often overlook the intricate interconnections between entities, a key aspect of the underlying topological structure of a KG. Stochastic blockmodels (SBMs), particularly the latent feature relational model (LFRM), offer robust probabilistic frameworks that can dynamically capture latent community structures and enhance link prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework of sparse latent feature models for KGC, optimized through a deep variational autoencoder (VAE). Our approach not only effectively completes missing triples but also provides clear interpretability of the latent structures, leveraging textual information. Comprehensive experiments on the WN18RR, FB15k-237, and Wikidata5M datasets show that our method significantly improves performance by revealing latent communities and producing interpretable representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifu Zhan, Shuang Zhou, Mingchen Li, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: \textbf{Objective:} We aimed to develop an advanced multi-task large language model (LLM) framework to extract multiple types of information about dietary supplements (DS) from clinical records.
  \textbf{Methods:} We used four core DS information extraction tasks - namely, named entity recognition (NER: 2,949 clinical sentences), relation extraction (RE: 4,892 sentences), triple extraction (TE: 2,949 sentences), and usage classification (UC: 2,460 sentences) as our multitasks. We introduced a novel Retrieval-Augmented Multi-task Information Extraction (RAMIE) Framework, including: 1) employed instruction fine-tuning techniques with task-specific prompts, 2) trained LLMs for multiple tasks with improved storage efficiency and lower training costs, and 3) incorporated retrieval augmentation generation (RAG) techniques by retrieving similar examples from the training set. We compared RAMIE's performance to LLMs with instruction fine-tuning alone and conducted an ablation study to assess the contributions of multi-task learning and RAG to improved multitasking performance.
  \textbf{Results:} With the aid of the RAMIE framework, Llama2-13B achieved an F1 score of 87.39 (3.51\% improvement) on the NER task and demonstrated outstanding performance on the RE task with an F1 score of 93.74 (1.15\% improvement). For the TE task, Llama2-7B scored 79.45 (14.26\% improvement), and MedAlpaca-7B achieved the highest F1 score of 93.45 (0.94\% improvement) on the UC task. The ablation study revealed that while MTL increased efficiency with a slight trade-off in performance, RAG significantly boosted overall accuracy.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study presents a novel RAMIE framework that demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-task information extraction for DS-related data from clinical records. Our framework can potentially be applied to other domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoye Qu, Daize Dong, Xuyang Hu, Tong Zhu, Weigao Sun, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, inspired by the concept of sparsity, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained increasing popularity for scaling model size while keeping the number of activated parameters constant. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the sparsity of the dense LLaMA model by constructing MoE for both the attention (i.e., Attention MoE) and MLP (i.e., MLP MoE) modules in the transformer blocks. Specifically, we investigate different expert construction methods and granularities under the same activation conditions to analyze the impact of sparsifying the model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate the model's capabilities across various domains (e.g., conversation, code, math) after sparsification, we apply sparsity to the instructed large language models (LLMs) and construct instructed MoE models. To counteract the performance degradation resulting from increased sparsity, we design a two-stage post-training strategy to enhance model performance. Experiments on the LLaMA3 model demonstrate the potential effectiveness of this approach for future developments of instructed MoE models.

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based pre-trained language models have dominated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for quite some time now. However, the Nepali language, spoken by approximately 32 million people worldwide, remains significantly underrepresented in this domain. This underrepresentation is primarily attributed to the scarcity of monolingual data corpora and limited available resources for the Nepali language. While existing efforts have predominantly concentrated on basic encoder-based models, there is a notable gap in the exploration of decoder-based architectures. To address this gap, we have collected 27.5 GB of Nepali text data, approximately 2.4x larger than any previously available Nepali language corpus. Leveraging this data, we pre-trained three different models i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, exclusively for the Nepali Language. Furthermore, we performed instruction tuning and explored its potential for monolingual Nepali data, providing a foundation for future research. Our models outperformed the existing best model by 2 points on Nep-gLUE benchmark, scoring 95.60 and also outperformed existing models on text generation tasks, demonstrating improvements in both understanding and generating Nepali text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic structure of languages poses significant challenges in applying natural language processing models on historical texts, causing decreased performance in various downstream tasks. Turkish is a prominent example of rapid linguistic transformation due to the language reform in the 20th century. In this paper, we propose two methods for detecting synonyms used in different time periods, focusing on Turkish. In our first method, we use Orthogonal Procrustes method to align the embedding spaces created using documents written in the corresponding time periods. In our second method, we extend the first one by incorporating Spearman's correlation between frequencies of words throughout the years. In our experiments, we show that our proposed methods outperform the baseline method. Furthermore, we observe that the efficacy of our methods remains consistent when the target time period shifts from the 1960s to the 1980s. However, their performance slightly decreases for subsequent time periods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Singh, Rajdeep Aher, Shivank Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, creating an increased need for efficient, task-specific fine-tuning methods. Traditional fine-tuning of LLMs involves updating a large number of parameters, which is computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning by reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, while LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, LoRA modules still create significant storage challenges. We propose LoRA-Mini, an optimized adaptation of LoRA that improves parameter efficiency by splitting low-rank matrices into four parts, with only the two inner matrices being trainable. This approach achieves upto a 20x reduction compared to standard LoRA in the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance levels comparable to standard LoRA, addressing both computational and storage efficiency in LLM fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Sajith, Krishna Chaitanya Rao Kathala</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the relative impact of training data quality versus quantity on the performance of small language models (SLMs), utilizing the TinyStories dataset for empirical analysis. Analysis of dataset variations with respect to size (25% and 50% of the original size) and duplication (controlled rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were performed. Model performance was evaluated based on the validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity metrics. Results indicate training data quality plays a more significant role in the overall performance of SLMs, especially given scale of this experiment. Minimal duplication positively impacted model accuracy (+0.87% increase in accuracy at 25% duplication) without significantly increasing perplexity (+0.52% increase going from 0% to 25% duplication) but excessive duplication led to pronounced performance degradation (-40% drop in accuracy at 100% duplication). The implications of this exploration extend beyond just model performance; training large-scale models imposes significant financial and computational burdens, which can be prohibitive for organizations, individuals, and the public at large, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with large-scale training raises environmental concerns. Understanding the relative importance of data quality versus quantity could democratize AI technology, making advanced models more accessible and sustainable for all.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. But there is still gap between their efficacy and typical explicit CoT methods. This leaves us a doubt that, does implicit CoT really equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is performing implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. Moreover, we find LLMs' implicit reasoning capabilities are susceptible and unstable, reaffirming the necessity of explicit CoT to effectively support complex tasks.</p>

To this end, we introduce two novel tasks related to distilling causal domain knowledge into causal variables and detecting interaction entities using LLMs. We have determined that contemporary LLMs are helpful tools for conducting causal modeling tasks in collaboration with human experts, as they can provide a wider perspective. Specifically, LLMs, such as GPT-4-turbo and Llama3-70b, perform better in distilling causal domain knowledge into causal variables compared to sparse expert models, such as Mixtral-8x22b. On the contrary, sparse expert models such as Mixtral-8x22b stand out as the most effective in identifying interaction entities. Finally, we highlight the dependency between the domain where the entities are generated and the performance of the chosen LLM for causal modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompts used in recent large language model based applications are often fixed and lengthy, leading to significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Generative Context Distillation (GCD), a lightweight prompt internalization method that employs a joint training approach. This method not only replicates the behavior of models with prompt inputs but also generates the content of the prompt along with reasons for why the model's behavior should change accordingly. We demonstrate that our approach effectively internalizes complex prompts across various agent-based application scenarios. For effective training without interactions with the dedicated environments, we introduce a data synthesis technique that autonomously collects conversational datasets by swapping the roles of the agent and environment. This method is especially useful in scenarios where only a predefined prompt is available without a corresponding training dataset. By internalizing complex prompts, Generative Context Distillation enables high-performance and efficient inference without the need for explicit prompts.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15993">Investigating Factuality in Long-Form Text Generation: The Roles of Self-Known and Self-Unknown</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lifu Tu, Rui Meng, Shafiq Joty, Yingbo Zhou, Semih Yavuz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, they often lack factuality, producing a mixture of true and false information, especially in long-form generation. In this work, we investigates the factuality of long-form text generation across various large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus, Llama-3-70B, and Mistral. Our analysis reveals that factuality scores tend to decline in later sentences of the generated text, accompanied by a rise in the number of unsupported claims. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of different evaluation settings to assess whether LLMs can accurately judge the correctness of their own outputs: Self-Known (the percentage of supported atomic claims, decomposed from LLM outputs, that the corresponding LLMs judge as correct) and Self-Unknown (the percentage of unsupported atomic claims that the corresponding LLMs judge as incorrect). The results indicate that even advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5-Pro fail to achieve perfect Self-Known scores, while their Self-Unknown scores remain notably above zero, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in their self-assessments. Moreover, we find a correlation between higher Self-Known scores and improved factuality, while higher Self-Unknown scores are associated with lower factuality. Interestingly, even without significant changes in the models' self-judgment (Self-Known and Self-Unknown), the number of unsupported claims can increases, likely as an artifact of long-form generation. These findings show the limitations of current LLMs in long-form generation, and provide valuable insights for improving factuality in long-form text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayanta Sadhu, Ayan Antik Khan, Noshin Nawal, Sanju Basak, Abhik Bhattacharjee, Rifat Shahriyar</p>
<p>Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the cognitive ability to infer and attribute mental states to oneself and others. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated for social and cognitive capabilities, it remains unclear to what extent these models demonstrate ToM across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive study of multilingual ToM capabilities aimed at addressing this gap. Our approach includes two key components: (1) We translate existing ToM datasets into multiple languages, effectively creating a multilingual ToM dataset and (2) We enrich these translations with culturally specific elements to reflect the social and cognitive scenarios relevant to diverse populations. We conduct extensive evaluations of six state-of-the-art LLMs to measure their ToM performance across both the translated and culturally adapted datasets. The results highlight the influence of linguistic and cultural diversity on the models' ability to exhibit ToM, and questions their social reasoning capabilities. This work lays the groundwork for future research into enhancing LLMs' cross-cultural social cognition and contributes to the development of more culturally aware and socially intelligent AI systems. All our data and code are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyan Yang, Yixuan Wang, Keyue Tong, Hongjin Zhu, Yuanxin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a detailed prompting flow, termed Table-Logic, to investigate the performance contrasts between bigger and smaller language models (LMs) utilizing step-by-step reasoning methods in the TableQA task. The method processes tasks by sequentially identifying critical columns and rows given question and table with its structure, determining necessary aggregations, calculations, or comparisons, and finally inferring the results to generate a precise prediction. By deploying this method, we observe a 7.8% accuracy improvement in bigger LMs like Llama-3-70B compared to the vanilla on HybridQA, while smaller LMs like Llama-2-7B shows an 11% performance decline. We empirically investigate the potential causes of performance contrasts by exploring the capabilities of bigger and smaller LMs from various dimensions in TableQA task. Our findings highlight the limitations of the step-by-step reasoning method in small models and provide potential insights for making improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into smart transportation systems has paved the way for improving data management and operational efficiency. This study introduces TransCompressor, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for efficient compression and decompression of multimodal transportation sensor data. TransCompressor has undergone thorough evaluation with diverse sensor data types, including barometer, speed, and altitude measurements, across various transportation modes like buses, taxis, and MTRs. Comprehensive evaluation illustrates the effectiveness of TransCompressor in reconstructing transportation sensor data at different compression ratios. The results highlight that, with well-crafted prompts, LLMs can utilize their vast knowledge base to contribute to data compression processes, enhancing data storage, analysis, and retrieval in smart transportation settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reshmi Ghosh, Tianyi Yao, Lizzy Chen, Sadid Hasan, Tianwei Chen, Dario Bernal, Huitian Jiao, H M Sajjad Hossain</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) integrations into applications like Microsoft365 suite and Google Workspace for creating/processing documents, emails, presentations, etc. has led to considerable enhancements in productivity and time savings. But as these integrations become more more complex, it is paramount to ensure that the quality of output from the LLM-integrated applications are relevant and appropriate for use. Identifying the need to develop robust evaluation approaches for natural language generation, wherein references/ground labels doesn't exist or isn't amply available, this paper introduces a novel framework called "SAGEval" which utilizes a critiquing Agent to provide feedback on scores generated by LLM evaluators. We show that the critiquing Agent is able to rectify scores from LLM evaluators, in absence of references/ground-truth labels, thereby reducing the need for labeled data even for complex NLG evaluation scenarios, like the generation of JSON-structured forms/surveys with responses in different styles like multiple choice, likert ratings, single choice questions, etc.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on their demonstrated ability to perform a variety of tasks, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs) to enhance in-depth analytical reasoning within the context of intelligence analysis. Intelligence analysts typically work with massive dossiers to draw connections between seemingly unrelated entities, and uncover adversaries' plans and motives. We explore if and how LLMs can be helpful to analysts for this task and develop an architecture to augment the capabilities of an LLM with a memory module called dynamic evidence trees (DETs) to develop and track multiple investigation threads. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we highlight how LLMs, as-is, are still inadequate to support intelligence analysts and offer recommendations to improve LLMs for such intricate reasoning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Liu, Yitong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to improve the robustness of foundation models to group-based biases. We propose a simple yet effective method, called DoubleCCA, that leverages random sentences and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to enrich the text embeddings of the foundation model. First, we generate various random sentences that augment the original prompts, which extends the original prompts with random words or character sequences. Second, we use an additional sentence embedding model to generate different text embeddings with respect to these random sentences. We then use CCA double twice to align the representations and reconstruct them back to the original representation space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks and datasets, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both performance and robustness. Our method is simple to implement and can be easily integrated into existing models, making it a practical solution for improving the robustness of foundation models to group-based biases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Cai, Arthur Zimek, Eirini Ntoutsi, Gerhard Wunder</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent literature highlights the critical role of neighborhood construction in deriving model-agnostic explanations, with a growing trend toward deploying generative models to improve synthetic instance quality, especially for explaining text classifiers. These approaches overcome the challenges in neighborhood construction posed by the unstructured nature of texts, thereby improving the quality of explanations. However, the deployed generators are usually implemented via neural networks and lack inherent explainability, sparking arguments over the transparency of the explanation process itself. To address this limitation while preserving neighborhood quality, this paper introduces a probability-based editing method as an alternative to black-box text generators. This approach generates neighboring texts by implementing manipulations based on in-text contexts. Substituting the generator-based construction process with recursive probability-based editing, the resultant explanation method, XPROB (explainer with probability-based editing), exhibits competitive performance according to the evaluation conducted on two real-world datasets. Additionally, XPROB's fully transparent and more controllable construction process leads to superior stability compared to the generator-based explainers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Abbasi, Mohammad Reza Modarres, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture has emerged as the dominant choice for building large language models (LLMs). However, with new LLMs emerging on a frequent basis, it is important to consider the potential value of architecture-agnostic approaches that can provide interpretability across a variety of architectures. Despite recent successes in the interpretability of LLMs, many existing approaches rely on complex methods that are often tied to a specific model design and come with a significant computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose a novel technique, called NormXLogit, for assessing the significance of individual input tokens. This method operates based on the input and output representations associated with each token. First, we demonstrate that during the pre-training of LLMs, the norms of word embeddings capture the importance of input tokens. Second, we reveal a significant relationship between a token's importance and the extent to which its representation can resemble the model's final prediction. Through extensive analysis, we show that our approach consistently outperforms existing gradient-based methods in terms of faithfulness. Additionally, our method achieves better performance in layer-wise explanations compared to the most prominent architecture-specific methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaolei Zhang, Kehao Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Shoutao Guo, Yan Zhou, Xiaodong Liu, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful generative capabilities and vast knowledge, empower various tasks in everyday life. However, these abilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively limited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore crucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive approach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct instruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for over 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing 2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment. To achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions, comprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and cross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning based on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages. Using Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B, and BayLing-3-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For multilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior performance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual knowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant improvements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its capability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing maintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the performance in low-resource languages. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing are available.</p>

In this work, we propose SUIT (SUbgoal-aware ITerative Training), an iterative training approach for improving ToD systems. We sample dialogs from the model we aim to improve and determine subgoals that contribute to dialog success using distant supervision to obtain high quality training samples. We show how this data improves supervised fine-tuning or, alternatively, preference learning results. SUIT is able to iteratively generate more data instead of relying on fixed static sets. SUIT reaches new state-of-the-art performance on a popular ToD benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kathrin Se{\ss}ler, Maurice F\"urstenberg, Babette B\"uhler, Enkelejda Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: The manual assessment and grading of student writing is a time-consuming yet critical task for teachers. Recent developments in generative AI, such as large language models, offer potential solutions to facilitate essay-scoring tasks for teachers. In our study, we evaluate the performance and reliability of both open-source and closed-source LLMs in assessing German student essays, comparing their evaluations to those of 37 teachers across 10 pre-defined criteria (i.e., plot logic, expression). A corpus of 20 real-world essays from Year 7 and 8 students was analyzed using five LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, o1, LLaMA 3-70B, and Mixtral 8x7B, aiming to provide in-depth insights into LLMs' scoring capabilities. Closed-source GPT models outperform open-source models in both internal consistency and alignment with human ratings, particularly excelling in language-related criteria. The novel o1 model outperforms all other LLMs, achieving Spearman's $r = .74$ with human assessments in the overall score, and an internal consistency of $ICC=.80$. These findings indicate that LLM-based assessment can be a useful tool to reduce teacher workload by supporting the evaluation of essays, especially with regard to language-related criteria. However, due to their tendency for higher scores, the models require further refinement to better capture aspects of content quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangkai Jiao, Geyang Guo, Xingxing Zhang, Nancy F. Chen, Shafiq Joty, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference optimization techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are frequently employed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in domains like mathematical reasoning and coding, typically following supervised fine-tuning. These methods rely on high-quality labels for reasoning tasks to generate preference pairs; however, the availability of reasoning datasets with human-verified labels is limited. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to generate pseudo feedback for reasoning tasks by framing the labeling of solutions to reason problems as an evaluation against associated test cases. We explore two forms of pseudo feedback based on test cases: one generated by frontier LLMs and the other by extending self-consistency to multi-test-case. We conduct experiments on both mathematical reasoning and coding tasks using pseudo feedback for preference optimization, and observe improvements across both tasks. Specifically, using Mathstral-7B as our base model, we improve MATH results from 58.3 to 68.6, surpassing both NuminaMath-72B and GPT-4-Turbo-1106-preview. In GSM8K and College Math, our scores increase from 85.6 to 90.3 and from 34.3 to 42.3, respectively. Building on Deepseek-coder-7B-v1.5, we achieve a score of 24.6 on LiveCodeBench (from 21.1), surpassing Claude-3-Haiku.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikita Balesni, Tomek Korbak, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: While LLMs excel at multi-hop questions (e.g. "Who is the spouse of the performer of Imagine?") when using chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT), they struggle when forced to reason internally (without CoT). Previous work on the size and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct and GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering two-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent reasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However, to our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when learned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level accuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose separately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier LLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT reasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial success with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a general capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question type.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agus Sudjianto, Aijun Zhang, Srinivas Neppalli, Tarun Joshi, Michal Malohlava</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for the evaluation and validation of generative language models (GLMs), with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed in high-stakes domains such as banking. GLM evaluation is challenging due to open-ended outputs and subjective quality assessments. Leveraging the structured nature of RAG systems, where generated responses are grounded in a predefined document collection, we propose the Human-Calibrated Automated Testing (HCAT) framework. HCAT integrates a) automated test generation using stratified sampling, b) embedding-based metrics for explainable assessment of functionality, risk and safety attributes, and c) a two-stage calibration approach that aligns machine-generated evaluations with human judgments through probability calibration and conformal prediction.
  In addition, the framework includes robustness testing to evaluate model performance against adversarial, out-of-distribution, and varied input conditions, as well as targeted weakness identification using marginal and bivariate analysis to pinpoint specific areas for improvement. This human-calibrated, multi-layered evaluation framework offers a scalable, transparent, and interpretable approach to GLM assessment, providing a practical and reliable solution for deploying GLMs in applications where accuracy, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge-enhanced language models (KELMs) have emerged as promising tools to bridge the gap between large-scale language models and domain-specific knowledge. KELMs can achieve higher factual accuracy and mitigate hallucinations by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs). They are frequently combined with adapter modules to reduce the computational load and risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) on adapter-based approaches to KELMs. We provide a structured overview of existing methodologies in the field through quantitative and qualitative analysis and explore the strengths and potential shortcomings of individual approaches. We show that general knowledge and domain-specific approaches have been frequently explored along with various adapter architectures and downstream tasks. We particularly focused on the popular biomedical domain, where we provided an insightful performance comparison of existing KELMs. We outline the main trends and propose promising future directions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16433">Finding Structure in Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaap Jumelet</p>
<p>Abstract: When we speak, write or listen, we continuously make predictions based on our knowledge of a language's grammar. Remarkably, children acquire this grammatical knowledge within just a few years, enabling them to understand and generalise to novel constructions that have never been uttered before. Language models are powerful tools that create representations of language by incrementally predicting the next word in a sentence, and they have had a tremendous societal impact in recent years. The central research question of this thesis is whether these models possess a deep understanding of grammatical structure similar to that of humans. This question lies at the intersection of natural language processing, linguistics, and interpretability. To address it, we will develop novel interpretability techniques that enhance our understanding of the complex nature of large-scale language models. We approach our research question from three directions. First, we explore the presence of abstract linguistic information through structural priming, a key paradigm in psycholinguistics for uncovering grammatical structure in human language processing. Next, we examine various linguistic phenomena, such as adjective order and negative polarity items, and connect a model's comprehension of these phenomena to the data distribution on which it was trained. Finally, we introduce a controlled testbed for studying hierarchical structure in language models using various synthetic languages of increasing complexity and examine the role of feature interactions in modelling this structure. Our findings offer a detailed account of the grammatical knowledge embedded in language model representations and provide several directions for investigating fundamental linguistic questions using computational methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaocong Yang, Jiacheng Lin, Ziqi Wang, Chengxiang Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to struggle with complicated reasoning tasks such as math word problems (MWPs). In this paper, we present how analogy from similarly structured questions can improve LLMs' problem-solving capabilities for MWPs. Specifically, we rely on the retrieval of problems with similar computational graphs to the given question to serve as exemplars in the prompt, providing the correct reasoning path for the generation model to refer to. Empirical results across six math word problem datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves a significant improvement of up to 6.7 percent on average in absolute value, compared to baseline methods. These results highlight our method's potential in addressing the reasoning challenges in current LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikrishna Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: We present our submission to the BabyLM challenge, aiming to push the boundaries of data-efficient language model pretraining. Our method builds upon deep mutual learning, introducing a student model search for diverse initialization. We address the limitation of treating students equally by formulating weighted mutual learning as a bi-level optimization problem. The inner loop learns compact students through online distillation, while the outer loop optimizes weights for better knowledge distillation from diverse students. This dynamic weighting strategy eliminates the need for a teacher model, reducing computational requirements. Our evaluations show that teacher-less methods can match or surpass teacher-supervised approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Huang, Haoyang Zou, Xuefeng Li, Yixiu Liu, Yuxiang Zheng, Ethan Chern, Shijie Xia, Yiwei Qin, Weizhe Yuan, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a critical examination of current approaches to replicating OpenAI's O1 model capabilities, with particular focus on the widespread but often undisclosed use of knowledge distillation techniques. While our previous work explored the fundamental technical path to O1 replication, this study reveals how simple distillation from O1's API, combined with supervised fine-tuning, can achieve superior performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that a base model fine-tuned on simply tens of thousands of samples O1-distilled long-thought chains outperforms O1-preview on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) with minimal technical complexity. Moreover, our investigation extends beyond mathematical reasoning to explore the generalization capabilities of O1-distilled models across diverse tasks: hallucination, safety and open-domain QA. Notably, despite training only on mathematical problem-solving data, our models demonstrated strong generalization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible to sycophancy after fine-tuning. We deliberately make this finding public to promote transparency in AI research and to challenge the current trend of obscured technical claims in the field. Our work includes: (1) A detailed technical exposition of the distillation process and its effectiveness, (2) A comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and categorizing O1 replication attempts based on their technical transparency and reproducibility, (3) A critical discussion of the limitations and potential risks of over-relying on distillation approaches, our analysis culminates in a crucial bitter lesson: while the pursuit of more capable AI systems is important, the development of researchers grounded in first-principles thinking is paramount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amy Xin, Jinxin Liu, Zijun Yao, Zhicheng Li, Shulin Cao, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks, but it is still challenging for LLMs to perform knowledge-intensive complex question answering due to LLMs' inefficacy in reasoning planning and the hallucination problem. A typical solution is to employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) coupled with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which decomposes complex questions into chain-like sub-questions and applies iterative RAG at each sub-question. However, prior works exhibit sub-optimal reasoning planning and overlook dynamic knowledge retrieval from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, we propose AtomR, a novel heterogeneous knowledge reasoning framework that conducts multi-source reasoning at the atomic level. Drawing inspiration from the graph modeling of knowledge, AtomR leverages large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex questions into combinations of three atomic knowledge operators, significantly enhancing the reasoning process at both the planning and execution stages. We also introduce BlendQA, a novel evaluation benchmark tailored to assess complex heterogeneous knowledge reasoning. Experiments show that AtomR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three single-source and two multi-source reasoning benchmarks, with notable performance gains of 9.4% on 2WikiMultihop and 9.5% on BlendQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are the foundation of the current successes of artificial intelligence (AI), however, they are unavoidably biased. To effectively communicate the risks and encourage mitigation efforts these models need adequate and intuitive descriptions of their discriminatory properties, appropriate for all audiences of AI. We suggest bias profiles with respect to stereotype dimensions based on dictionaries from social psychology research. Along these dimensions we investigate gender bias in contextual embeddings, across contexts and layers, and generate stereotype profiles for twelve different LLMs, demonstrating their intuition and use case for exposing and visualizing bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to spend more time thinking and reflection before responding is crucial for effectively solving complex reasoning tasks in fields such as science, coding, and mathematics. However, the effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correction depends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, which can be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, and the lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-player paradigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the critique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor) model during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique, an automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in a dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning language models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language feedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models consistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time, especially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these findings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's self-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement method. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration efficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading to a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to explore training self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase its potential.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iacopo Ghinassi, Lin Wang, Chris Newell, Matthew Purver</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear Text Segmentation is the task of automatically tagging text documents with topic shifts, i.e. the places in the text where the topics change. A well-established area of research in Natural Language Processing, drawing from well-understood concepts in linguistic and computational linguistic research, the field has recently seen a lot of interest as a result of the surge of text, video, and audio available on the web, which in turn require ways of summarising and categorizing the mole of content for which linear text segmentation is a fundamental step. In this survey, we provide an extensive overview of current advances in linear text segmentation, describing the state of the art in terms of resources and approaches for the task. Finally, we highlight the limitations of available resources and of the task itself, while indicating ways forward based on the most recent literature and under-explored research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh Ponkshe, Venkatapathy Subramanian, Natwar Modani, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Most state-of-the-art techniques for Language Models (LMs) today rely on transformer-based architectures and their ubiquitous attention mechanism. However, the exponential growth in computational requirements with longer input sequences confines Transformers to handling short passages. Recent efforts have aimed to address this limitation by introducing selective attention mechanisms, notably local and global attention. While sparse attention mechanisms, akin to full attention in being Turing-complete, have been theoretically established, their practical impact on pre-training remains unexplored. This study focuses on empirically assessing the influence of global attention on BERT pre-training. The primary steps involve creating an extensive corpus of structure-aware text through arXiv data, alongside a text-only counterpart. We carry out pre-training on these two datasets, investigate shifts in attention patterns, and assess their implications for downstream tasks. Our analysis underscores the significance of incorporating document structure into LM models, demonstrating their capacity to excel in more abstract tasks, such as document understanding.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16638">Do Automatic Factuality Metrics Measure Factuality? A Critical Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjana Ramprasad, Byron C. Wallace</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point where traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have become saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce unwanted content into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by their source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle ``hallucinations'' automatically has proved to be challenging. This in turn has motivated development of a variety of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against their source. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to do? In this work, we stress-test automatic factuality metrics. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what degree superficial attributes of summary texts suffice to predict ``factuality'', finding that a (supervised) model using only such shallow features is reasonably competitive with SOTA factuality scoring methods. We then evaluate how factuality metrics respond to factual corrections in inconsistent summaries and find that only a few show meaningful improvements. In contrast, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, non-factual edits. Motivated by these insights, we show that one can ``game'' (most) automatic factuality metrics, i.e., reliably inflate ``factuality'' scores by appending innocuous sentences to generated summaries.Taken together, our results raise questions about the degree to which we should rely on existing automated factuality metrics and what exactly we want ``factuality metrics'' to measure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yu, Zhengxing Chen, Aston Zhang, Liang Tan, Chenguang Zhu, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Yundi Qian, Xuewei Wang, Suchin Gururangan, Chao Zhang, Melanie Kambadur, Dhruv Mahajan, Rui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesize that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16679">Do Large Language Models Perform Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning without Exploiting Shortcuts?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohee Yang, Nora Kassner, Elena Gribovskaya, Sebastian Riedel, Mor Geva</p>
<p>Abstract: We evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) latently recall and compose facts to answer multi-hop queries like "In the year Scarlett Johansson was born, the Summer Olympics were hosted in the country of". One major challenge in evaluating this ability is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encounters of the head entity "Scarlett Johansson" and the answer entity "United States" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities co-appear in pretraining corpora. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought composability highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parosh Aziz Abdulla, Mohamed Faouzi Atig, Julie Cailler, Chencheng Liang, Philipp R\"ummer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a Graph Neural Network-guided algorithm for solving word equations, based on the well-known Nielsen transformation for splitting equations. The algorithm iteratively rewrites the first terms of each side of an equation, giving rise to a tree-like search space. The choice of path at each split point of the tree significantly impacts solving time, motivating the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for efficient split decision-making. Split decisions are encoded as multi-classification tasks, and five graph representations of word equations are introduced to encode their structural information for GNNs. The algorithm is implemented as a solver named DragonLi. Experiments are conducted on artificial and real-world benchmarks. The algorithm performs particularly well on satisfiable problems. For single word \mbox{equations}, DragonLi can solve significantly more problems than well-established string solvers. For the conjunction of multiple word equations, DragonLi is competitive with state-of-the-art string solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guofeng Yang, Yu Li, Yong He, Zhenjiang Zhou, Lingzhen Ye, Hui Fang, Yiqi Luo, Xuping Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: UAV remote sensing technology has become a key technology in crop breeding, which can achieve high-throughput and non-destructive collection of crop phenotyping data. However, the multidisciplinary nature of breeding has brought technical barriers and efficiency challenges to knowledge mining. Therefore, it is important to develop a smart breeding goal tool to mine cross-domain multimodal data. Based on different pre-trained open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., Qwen-VL, InternVL, Deepseek-VL), this study used supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) technologies to inject cross-domain knowledge into MLLMs, thereby constructing multiple multimodal large language models for wheat breeding (WBLMs). The above WBLMs were evaluated using the newly created evaluation benchmark in this study. The results showed that the WBLM constructed using SFT, RAG and RLHF technologies and InternVL2-8B has leading performance. Then, subsequent experiments were conducted using the WBLM. Ablation experiments indicated that the combination of SFT, RAG, and RLHF technologies can improve the overall generation performance, enhance the generated quality, balance the timeliness and adaptability of the generated answer, and reduce hallucinations and biases. The WBLM performed best in wheat yield prediction using cross-domain data (remote sensing, phenotyping, weather, germplasm) simultaneously, with R2 and RMSE of 0.821 and 489.254 kg/ha, respectively. Furthermore, the WBLM can generate professional decision support answers for phenotyping estimation, environmental stress assessment, target germplasm screening, cultivation technique recommendation, and seed price query tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language pre-training via contrastive learning have significantly improved performance across computer vision tasks.

To mitigate data scarcity while boosting model performance, we introduce \textbf{Uni-Mlip}, a unified self-supervision framework specifically designed to enhance medical vision-language pre-training. Uni-Mlip seamlessly integrates cross-modality, uni-modality, and fused-modality self-supervision techniques at the data-level and the feature-level. Additionally, Uni-Mlip tailors uni-modal image self-supervision to accommodate the unique characteristics of medical images. Our experiments across datasets of varying scales demonstrate that Uni-Mlip significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in three key downstream tasks: image-text retrieval, image classification, and visual question answering (VQA).</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated substantial success in self-supervised representation learning for vision tasks. However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.

From the myths of Talos to Aristotelian logic and Heron's inventions, we have sought to replicate the marvels of the mind. While recent advances in AI hold promise, singular approaches often fall short in capturing the essence of intelligence. This paper explores how fundamental principles from biological computation--particularly context-dependent, hierarchical information processing, trial-and-error heuristics, and multi-scale organization--can guide the design of truly intelligent systems. By examining the nuanced mechanisms of biological intelligence, such as top-down causality and adaptive interaction with the environment, we aim to illuminate potential limitations in artificial constructs. Our goal is to provide a framework inspired by biological systems for designing more adaptable and robust artificial intelligent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lu, Chengrong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Log-system is an important mechanism for recording the runtime status and events of Web service systems, and anomaly detection in logs is an effective method of detecting problems. However, manual anomaly detection in logs is inefficient, error-prone, and unrealistic. Existing log anomaly detection methods either use the indexes of event templates, or form vectors by embedding the fixed string part of the template as a sentence, or use time parameters for sequence analysis. However, log entries often contain features and semantic information that cannot be fully represented by these methods, resulting in missed and false alarms. In this paper, we propose TPLogAD, a universal unsupervised method for analyzing unstructured logs, which performs anomaly detection based on event templates and key parameters. The itemplate2vec and para2vec included in TPLogAD are two efficient and easy-to-implement semantic representation methods for logs, detecting anomalies in event templates and parameters respectively, which has not been achieved in previous work. Additionally, TPLogAD can avoid the interference of log diversity and dynamics on anomaly detection. Our experiments on four public log datasets show that TPLogAD outperforms existing log anomaly detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhe Chen, Tianshu Zhang, Shiyu Huang, Yuwei Niu, Linfeng Zhang, Lijie Wen, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent breakthroughs achieved by Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in understanding and responding to complex visual-textual contexts, their inherent hallucination tendencies limit their practical application in real-world scenarios that demand high levels of precision. Existing methods typically either fine-tune the LVLMs using additional data, which incurs extra costs in manual annotation and computational resources or perform comparisons at the decoding stage, which may eliminate useful language priors for reasoning while introducing inference time overhead. Therefore, we propose ICT, a lightweight, training-free method that calculates an intervention direction to shift the model's focus towards different levels of visual information, enhancing its attention to high-level and fine-grained visual details. During the forward pass stage, the intervention is applied to the attention heads that encode the overall image information and the fine-grained object details, effectively mitigating the phenomenon of overly language priors, and thereby alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICT achieves strong performance with a small amount of data and generalizes well across different datasets and models. Our code will be public.</p>

<p>Abstract: As a prominent direction of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered increased attention from both industry and academia. Building upon pre-trained LLMs, this family of models further develops multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities that are impressive, such as writing code given a flow chart or creating stories based on an image. In the development process, evaluation is critical since it provides intuitive feedback and guidance on improving models. Distinct from the traditional train-eval-test paradigm that only favors a single task like image classification, the versatility of MLLMs has spurred the rise of various new benchmarks and evaluation methods. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of MLLM evaluation, discussing four key aspects: 1) the summarised benchmarks types divided by the evaluation capabilities, including foundation capabilities, model self-analysis, and extented applications; 2) the typical process of benchmark counstruction, consisting of data collection, annotation, and precautions; 3) the systematic evaluation manner composed of judge, metric, and toolkit; 4) the outlook for the next benchmark. This work aims to offer researchers an easy grasp of how to effectively evaluate MLLMs according to different needs and to inspire better evaluation methods, thereby driving the progress of MLLM research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moses Charikar, Chirag Pabbaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent work of Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] provides a concrete model for language generation in the limit: given a sequence of examples from an unknown target language, the goal is to generate new examples from the target language such that no incorrect examples are generated beyond some point. In sharp contrast to strong negative results for the closely related problem of language identification, they establish positive results for language generation in the limit for all countable collections of languages. Follow-up work by Raman and Tewari [RT24] studies bounds on the number of distinct inputs required by an algorithm before correct language generation is achieved -- namely, whether this is a constant for all languages in the collection (uniform generation) or a language-dependent constant (non-uniform generation).
  We show that every countable language collection has a generator which has the stronger property of non-uniform generation in the limit. However, while the generation algorithm of [KM24] can be implemented using membership queries, we show that any algorithm cannot non-uniformly generate even for collections of just two languages, using only membership queries.
  We also formalize the tension between validity and breadth in the generation algorithm of [KM24] by introducing a definition of exhaustive generation, and show a strong negative result for exhaustive generation. Our result shows that a tradeoff between validity and breadth is inherent for generation in the limit. Finally, inspired by algorithms that can choose to obtain feedback, we consider a model of uniform generation with feedback, completely characterizing language collections for which such uniform generation with feedback is possible in terms of a complexity measure of the collection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Hong, Weinan Wang, Laleh Najafizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: P300 speller BCIs allow users to compose sentences by selecting target keys on a GUI through the detection of P300 component in their EEG signals following visual stimuli. Most P300 speller BCIs require users to spell words letter by letter, or the first few initial letters, resulting in high keystroke demands that increase time, cognitive load, and fatigue. This highlights the need for more efficient, user-friendly methods for faster sentence composition. In this work, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from user-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing keystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word suggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A new GUI, displaying GPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. SWLDA is used for the P300 classification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1) copy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a sentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that in Task 1, on average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time and keystrokes by 62.14% and 53.22%, respectively, and increasing information transfer rate by 198.96%. In Task 2, ChatBCI achieves 80.68% keystroke savings and a record 8.53 characters/min for typing speed. Overall, ChatBCI, by employing remote LLM queries, enhances sentence composition in realistic scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional spellers without requiring local model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-) word predictions, combined with its new GUI, pave the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that are efficient and effective for real-time communication, especially for users with communication and motor disabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khalid Hasan, Jamil Saquer</p>
<p>Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health problem involving more than 700,000 deaths yearly, particularly among young adults. Many people express their suicidal thoughts on social media platforms such as Reddit. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the deep learning transformer-based models BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA and various Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based models in detecting suicidal ideation from user posts on Reddit. Toward this objective, we curated an extensive dataset from diverse subreddits and conducted linguistic, topic modeling, and statistical analyses to ensure data quality. Our results indicate that each model could reach high accuracy and F1 scores, but among them, RoBERTa emerged as the most effective model with an accuracy of 93.22% and F1 score of 93.14%. An LSTM model that uses attention and BERT embeddings performed as the second best, with an accuracy of 92.65% and an F1 score of 92.69%. Our findings show that transformer-based models have the potential to improve suicide ideation detection, thereby providing a path to develop robust mental health monitoring tools from social media. This research, therefore, underlines the undeniable prospect of advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) while improving suicide prevention efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Saqr, Sonsoles L\'opez-Pernas, Tiina T\"orm\"anen, Rogers Kaliisa, Kamila Misiejuk, Santtu Tikka</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework: Transition Network Analysis (TNA), an approach that integrates Stochastic Process Mining and probabilistic graph representation to model, visualize, and identify transition patterns in the learning process data. Combining the relational and temporal aspects into a single lens offers capabilities beyond either framework, including centralities to capture important learning events, community finding to identify patterns of behavior, and clustering to reveal temporal patterns. This paper introduces the theoretical and mathematical foundations of TNA. To demonstrate the functionalities of TNA, we present a case study with students (n=191) engaged in small-group collaboration to map patterns of group dynamics using the theories of co-regulation and socially-shared regulated learning. The analysis revealed that TNA could reveal the regulatory processes and identify important events, temporal patterns and clusters. Bootstrap validation established the significant transitions and eliminated spurious transitions. In doing so, we showcase TNA's utility to capture learning dynamics and provide a robust framework for investigating the temporal evolution of learning processes. Future directions include advancing estimation methods, expanding reliability assessment, exploring longitudinal TNA, and comparing TNA networks using permutation tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wu, Min Zeng, Yang Li, Yang Zhang, Min Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Most current molecular language models transfer the masked language model or image-text generation model from natural language processing to molecular field. However, molecules are not solely characterized by atom/bond symbols; they encapsulate important physical/chemical properties. Moreover, normal language models bring grammar rules that are irrelevant for understanding molecules. In this study, we propose a novel physicochemical knowledge-guided molecular meta language framework MolMetaLM. We design a molecule-specialized meta language paradigm, formatted as multiple <S,P,O> (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples sharing the same S (i.e., molecule) to enhance learning the semantic relationships between physicochemical knowledge and molecules. By introducing different molecular knowledge and noises, the meta language paradigm generates tens of thousands of pretraining tasks. By recovering the token/sequence/order-level noises, MolMetaLM exhibits proficiency in large-scale benchmark evaluations involving property prediction, molecule generation, conformation inference, and molecular optimization. Through MolMetaLM, we offer a new insight for designing language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: CQA services are valuable sources of knowledge that can be used to find answers to users' information needs. In these services, question retrieval aims to help users with their information needs by finding similar questions to theirs. However, finding similar questions is obstructed by the lexical gap that exists between relevant questions. In this work, we target this problem by using query expansion methods. We use word-similarity-based methods, propose a question-similarity-based method and selective expansion of these methods to expand a question that's been submitted and mitigate the lexical gap problem. Our best method achieves a significant relative improvement of 1.8\% compared to the best-performing baseline without query expansion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Al Rabeyah, Fabr\'icio G\'oes, Marco Volpe, Talles Medeiros</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) show agreement in assessing creativity in responses to the Alternative Uses Test (AUT). While LLMs are increasingly used to evaluate creative content, previous studies have primarily focused on a single model assessing responses generated by the same model or humans. This paper explores whether LLMs can impartially and accurately evaluate creativity in outputs generated by both themselves and other models. Using an oracle benchmark set of AUT responses, categorized by creativity level (common, creative, and highly creative), we experiment with four state-of-the-art LLMs evaluating these outputs. We test both scoring and ranking methods and employ two evaluation settings (comprehensive and segmented) to examine if LLMs agree on the creativity evaluation of alternative uses. Results reveal high inter-model agreement, with Spearman correlations averaging above 0.7 across models and reaching over 0.77 with respect to the oracle, indicating a high level of agreement and validating the reliability of LLMs in creativity assessment of alternative uses. Notably, models do not favour their own responses, instead they provide similar creativity assessment scores or rankings for alternative uses generated by other models. These findings suggest that LLMs exhibit impartiality and high alignment in creativity evaluation, offering promising implications for their use in automated creativity assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wang, Mingyue Cheng, Qingyang Mao, Qi Liu, Feiyang Xu, Xin Li, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlie Snell, Eric Wallace, Dan Klein, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental open challenge in modern LLM scaling is the lack of understanding around emergent capabilities. In particular, language model pretraining loss is known to be highly predictable as a function of compute. However, downstream capabilities are far less predictable -- sometimes even exhibiting emergent jumps -- which makes it challenging to anticipate the capabilities of future models. In this work, we first pose the task of emergence prediction: given access to current LLMs that have random few-shot accuracy on a task, can we predict whether future models (GPT-N+1) will have non-trivial accuracy on that task? We then discover a simple insight for this problem: finetuning LLMs on a given task can shift the point in scaling at which emergence occurs towards less capable models. To operationalize this insight, we can finetune LLMs with varying amounts of data and fit a parametric function that predicts when emergence will occur (i.e., "emergence laws"). We validate this approach using four standard NLP benchmarks where large-scale open-source LLMs already demonstrate emergence (MMLU, GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, and CoLA). Using only small-scale LLMs, we find that, in some cases, we can accurately predict whether models trained with up to 4x more compute have emerged. Finally, we present a case study of two realistic uses for emergence prediction.</p>

In this work, we propose a \textbf{single-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename Cautious Optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jatin Nainani, Sankaran Vaidyanathan, AJ Yeung, Kartik Gupta, David Jensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the inner workings of large neural networks by identifying circuits, or minimal subgraphs within the model that implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks. These circuits are typically discovered and analyzed using a narrowly defined prompt format. However, given the abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generalize across various prompt formats for the same task, it remains unclear how well these circuits generalize. For instance, it is unclear whether the models generalization results from reusing the same circuit components, the components behaving differently, or the use of entirely different components. In this paper, we investigate the generality of the indirect object identification (IOI) circuit in GPT-2 small, which is well-studied and believed to implement a simple, interpretable algorithm. We evaluate its performance on prompt variants that challenge the assumptions of this algorithm. Our findings reveal that the circuit generalizes surprisingly well, reusing all of its components and mechanisms while only adding additional input edges. Notably, the circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm should fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2 Hacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible and general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying circuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges when dealing with complex reasoning tasks, often resulting in hallucinations, which limit the practical application of LLMs. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new method that integrates different LLMs to expand the knowledge boundary, reduce dependence on a single model, and promote in-depth debate among agents. The main contributions include: 1) Introducing third-party LLMs to adjust the attention weights of agents through uncertainty estimation and confidence analysis, optimizing consensus formation in multi-agent systems; 2) Experiments on arithmetic datasets have validated the effectiveness of the method, surpassing traditional multi-agent baselines. This research provides a new perspective for large models to alleviate hallucination phenomena when dealing with complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yi, Qingyang Li, Yulan Hu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality video-text preference data is crucial for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) alignment. However, existing preference data is very scarce. Obtaining VQA preference data for preference training is costly, and manually annotating responses is highly unreliable, which could result in low-quality pairs. Meanwhile, AI-generated responses controlled by temperature adjustment lack diversity. To address these issues, we propose a high-quality VQA preference dataset, called \textit{\textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}rtificial \textbf{I}ntelligence \textbf{P}reference Datasets in \textbf{V}QA} (\textbf{MMAIP-V}), which is constructed by sampling from the response distribution set and using an external scoring function for response evaluation. Furthermore, to fully leverage the preference knowledge in MMAIP-V and ensure sufficient optimization, we propose \textit{\textbf{Iter}ative \textbf{W}eak-to-\textbf{S}trong \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning from \textbf{AI} \textbf{F}eedback for video MLLMs} (\textbf{Iter-W2S-RLAIF}), a framework that gradually enhances MLLMs' alignment capabilities by iteratively updating the reference model and performing parameter extrapolation. Finally, we propose an unbiased and information-complete evaluation scheme in VQA evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that MMAIP-V is beneficial for MLLMs in preference learning and Iter-W2S-RLAIF fully exploits the alignment information in MMAIP-V. We believe that the proposed automatic VQA preference data generation pipeline based on AI feedback can greatly promote future work in the MLLMs alignment. \textbf{Code and dataset are available} \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MMAIP-V_Iter-W2S-RLAIF-702F}{MMAIP-V\_Iter-W2S-RLAIF-702F}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Chieh Chang, Pei-Yuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. This approach has enabled significant advancements, as evidenced by performance on benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. Existing studies debate whether LLMs encode numerical values or rely on symbolic reasoning, while others explore attention and multi-layered processing in arithmetic tasks. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as \emph{Commutativity} and \emph{Identity} properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) generally focus on only a few regions and languages. As LMMs continue to improve, it is increasingly important to ensure they understand cultural contexts, respect local sensitivities, and support low-resource languages, all while effectively integrating corresponding visual cues. In pursuit of culturally diverse global multimodal models, our proposed All Languages Matter Benchmark (ALM-bench) represents the largest and most comprehensive effort to date for evaluating LMMs across 100 languages. ALM-bench challenges existing models by testing their ability to understand and reason about culturally diverse images paired with text in various languages, including many low-resource languages traditionally underrepresented in LMM research. The benchmark offers a robust and nuanced evaluation framework featuring various question formats, including true/false, multiple choice, and open-ended questions, which are further divided into short and long-answer categories. ALM-bench design ensures a comprehensive assessment of a model's ability to handle varied levels of difficulty in visual and linguistic reasoning. To capture the rich tapestry of global cultures, ALM-bench carefully curates content from 13 distinct cultural aspects, ranging from traditions and rituals to famous personalities and celebrations. Through this, ALM-bench not only provides a rigorous testing ground for state-of-the-art open and closed-source LMMs but also highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic inclusivity, encouraging the development of models that can serve diverse global populations effectively. Our benchmark is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Song, Anirudh Subramanyam, Irene Madejski, Robert L. Grossman</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current paradigm of image captioning, deep learning models are trained to generate text from image embeddings of latent features. We challenge the assumption that these latent features ought to be high-dimensional vectors which require model fine tuning to handle. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a text-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG), where the task is to generate a clinician's report detailing their observations from a set of radiological images, such as X-rays. We argue that simple linear classifiers over extracted image embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image feature encoder models, and without ever directly "showing" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further present results of our experiments with various components of LaB-RAG to better understand our method. Finally, we critique the use of a popular RRG metric, arguing it is possible to artificially inflate its results without true data-leakage.</p>

Our key contributions are prompt tuning on \textit{single-head} transformers with only a \textit{single} self-attention layer: (i) is universal, and (ii) supports efficient (even almost-linear time) algorithms under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Statistically, we prove that prompt tuning on such simplest possible transformers are universal approximators for sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions. In addition, we provide an exponential-in-$dL$ and -in-$(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound on the required soft-prompt tokens for prompt tuning to memorize any dataset with 1-layer, 1-head transformers. Computationally, we identify a phase transition in the efficiency of prompt tuning, determined by the norm of the \textit{soft-prompt-induced} keys and queries, and provide an upper bound criterion. Beyond this criterion, no sub-quadratic (efficient) algorithm for prompt tuning exists under SETH. Within this criterion, we showcase our theory by proving the existence of almost-linear time prompt tuning inference algorithms. These fundamental limits provide important necessary conditions for designing expressive and efficient prompt tuning methods for practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Hee Song, Valts Blukis, Jonathan Tremblay, Stephen Tyree, Yu Su, Stan Birchfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial understanding is a crucial capability for robots to make grounded decisions based on their environment. This foundational skill enables robots not only to perceive their surroundings but also to reason about and interact meaningfully within the world. In modern robotics, these capabilities are taken on by visual language models, and they face significant challenges when applied to spatial reasoning context due to their training data sources. These sources utilize general-purpose image datasets, and they often lack sophisticated spatial scene understanding capabilities. For example, the datasets do not address reference frame comprehension - spatial relationships require clear contextual understanding, whether from an ego-centric, object-centric, or world-centric perspective, which allow for effective real-world interaction. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale spatial understanding dataset consisting of real indoor and tabletop scenes captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5K 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, with paired 2D egocentric images and 3D scans to make it both 2D and 3D ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robotics manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriyar Zaman Ridoy, Md. Shazzad Hossain Shaon, Alfredo Cuzzocrea, Mst Shapna Akter</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated detection of software vulnerabilities is critical for enhancing security, yet existing methods often struggle with the complexity and diversity of modern codebases. In this paper, we introduce EnStack, a novel ensemble stacking framework that enhances vulnerability detection using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our approach synergizes multiple pre-trained large language models (LLMs) specialized in code understanding CodeBERT for semantic analysis, GraphCodeBERT for structural representation, and UniXcoder for cross-modal capabilities. By fine-tuning these models on the Draper VDISC dataset and integrating their outputs through meta-classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, EnStack effectively captures intricate code patterns and vulnerabilities that individual models may overlook. The meta-classifiers consolidate the strengths of each LLM, resulting in a comprehensive model that excels in detecting subtle and complex vulnerabilities across diverse programming contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that EnStack significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving notable improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This work highlights the potential of ensemble LLM approaches in code analysis tasks and offers valuable insights into applying NLP techniques for advancing automated vulnerability detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

<p>Abstract: Jailbreak prompts pose a significant threat in AI and cybersecurity, as they are crafted to bypass ethical safeguards in large language models, potentially enabling misuse by cybercriminals. This paper analyzes jailbreak prompts from a cyber defense perspective, exploring techniques like prompt injection and context manipulation that allow harmful content generation, content filter evasion, and sensitive information extraction. We assess the impact of successful jailbreaks, from misinformation and automated social engineering to hazardous content creation, including bioweapons and explosives. To address these threats, we propose strategies involving advanced prompt analysis, dynamic safety protocols, and continuous model fine-tuning to strengthen AI resilience. Additionally, we highlight the need for collaboration among AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to set standards for protecting AI systems. Through case studies, we illustrate these cyber defense approaches, promoting responsible AI practices to maintain system integrity and public trust. \textbf{\color{red}Warning: This paper contains content which the reader may find offensive.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Storytelling video generation (SVG) has recently emerged as a task to create long, multi-motion, multi-scene videos that consistently represent the story described in the input text script. SVG holds great potential for diverse content creation in media and entertainment; however, it also presents significant challenges: (1) objects must exhibit a range of fine-grained, complex motions, (2) multiple objects need to appear consistently across scenes, and (3) subjects may require multiple motions with seamless transitions within a single scene. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We compare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Shardlow, Piotr Przyby{\l}a</p>
<p>Abstract: This work is intended as a voice in the discussion over previous claims that a pretrained large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer model architecture can be sentient. Such claims have been made concerning the LaMDA model and also concerning the current wave of LLM-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT. This claim, if confirmed, would have serious ramifications in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to wide-spread use of similar models. However, here we take the position that such a large language model cannot be sentient, or conscious, and that LaMDA in particular exhibits no advances over other similar models that would qualify it. We justify this by analysing the Transformer architecture through Integrated Information Theory of consciousness. We see the claims of sentience as part of a wider tendency to use anthropomorphic language in NLP reporting. Regardless of the veracity of the claims, we consider this an opportune moment to take stock of progress in language modelling and consider the ethical implications of the task. In order to make this work helpful for readers outside the NLP community, we also present the necessary background in language modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdurahman Maarouf, Dominik B\"ar, Dominique Geissler, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Online propaganda poses a severe threat to the integrity of societies. However, existing datasets for detecting online propaganda have a key limitation: they were annotated using weak labels that can be noisy and even incorrect. To address this limitation, our work makes the following contributions: (1) We present HQP: a novel dataset (N = 30,000) for detecting online propaganda with high-quality labels. To the best of our knowledge, HQP is the first large-scale dataset for detecting online propaganda that was created through human annotation. (2) We show empirically that state-of-the-art language models fail in detecting online propaganda when trained with weak labels (AUC: 64.03). In contrast, state-of-the-art language models can accurately detect online propaganda when trained with our high-quality labels (AUC: 92.25), which is an improvement of ~44%. (3) We show that prompt-based learning using a small sample of high-quality labels can still achieve a reasonable performance (AUC: 80.27) while significantly reducing the cost of labeling. (4) We extend HQP to HQP+ to test how well propaganda across different contexts can be detected. Crucially, our work highlights the importance of high-quality labels for sensitive NLP tasks such as propaganda detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Liu, Haiwen Li, Zhicheng Zhao, Yuan Dong, Nikolaos V. Boulgouris</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is to retrieve specific person images according to the given textual descriptions. A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingji Zhang, Danilo S. Carvalho, Ian Pratt-Hartmann, Andre Freitas</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable natural language inference aims to provide a mechanism to produce explanatory (abductive) inference chains which ground claims to their supporting premises. A recent corpus called EntailmentBank strives to advance this task by explaining the answer to a question using an entailment tree \cite{dalvi2021explaining}. They employ the T5 model to directly generate the tree, which can explain how the answer is inferred. However, it lacks the ability to explain and control the generation of intermediate steps, which is crucial for the multi-hop inference process. % One recent corpus, EntailmentBank, aims to push this task forward by explaining an answer to a question according to an entailment tree \cite{dalvi2021explaining}. They employ T5 to generate the tree directly, which can explain how the answer is inferred but cannot explain how the intermediate is generated, which is essential to the multi-hop inference process. In this work, we focus on proposing a controlled natural language inference architecture for multi-premise explanatory inference. To improve control and enable explanatory analysis over the generation, we define lexical inference types based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph and modify the architecture of T5 to learn a latent sentence representation (T5 bottleneck) conditioned on said type information. We also deliver a dataset of approximately 5000 annotated explanatory inference steps, with well-grounded lexical-symbolic operations. Experimental results indicate that the inference typing induced at the T5 bottleneck can help T5 to generate a conclusion under explicit control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personality profiling has been utilised by companies for targeted advertising, political campaigns and public health campaigns. However, the accuracy and versatility of such models remains relatively unknown. Here we explore the extent to which peoples' online digital footprints can be used to profile their Myers-Briggs personality type. We analyse and compare four models: logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests. We discover that a SVM model achieves the best accuracy of 20.95% for predicting a complete personality type. However, logistic regression models perform only marginally worse and are significantly faster to train and perform predictions. Moreover, we develop a statistical framework for assessing the importance of different sets of features in our models. We discover some features to be more informative than others in the Intuitive/Sensory (p = 0.032) and Thinking/Feeling (p = 0.019) models. Many labelled datasets present substantial class imbalances of personal characteristics on social media, including our own. We therefore highlight the need for attentive consideration when reporting model performance on such datasets and compare a number of methods to fix class-imbalance problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ge Gao, Jonathan D. Chang, Claire Cardie, Kiant\'e Brantley, Thorsten Joachim</p>
<p>Abstract: Text retrieval plays a crucial role in incorporating factual knowledge for decision making into language processing pipelines, ranging from chat-based web search to question answering systems. Current state-of-the-art text retrieval models leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to achieve competitive performance, but training LLM-based retrievers via typical contrastive losses requires intricate heuristics, including selecting hard negatives and using additional supervision as learning signals. This reliance on heuristics stems from the fact that the contrastive loss itself is heuristic and does not directly optimize the downstream metrics of decision quality at the end of the processing pipeline. To address this issue, we introduce Neural PG-RANK, a novel training algorithm that learns to rank by instantiating a LLM as a Plackett-Luce ranking policy. Neural PG-RANK provides a principled method for end-to-end training of retrieval models as part of larger decision systems via policy gradient, with little reliance on complex heuristics, and it effectively unifies the training objective with downstream decision-making quality. We conduct extensive experiments on various text retrieval benchmarks. The results demonstrate that when the training objective aligns with the evaluation setup, Neural PG-RANK yields remarkable in-domain performance improvement, with substantial out-of-domain generalization to some critical datasets employed in downstream question answering tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, climate change repercussions have increasingly captured public interest. Consequently, corporations are emphasizing their environmental efforts in sustainability reports to bolster their public image. Yet, the absence of stringent regulations in review of such reports allows potential greenwashing. In this study, we introduce a novel preliminary methodology to train a language model on generated labels for greenwashing risk. Our primary contributions encompass: developing a preliminary mathematical formulation to quantify greenwashing risk, a fine-tuned ClimateBERT model for this problem, and a comparative analysis of results. On a test set comprising of sustainability reports, our best model achieved an average accuracy score of 86.34% and F1 score of 0.67, demonstrating that our proof-of-concept methodology shows a promising direction of exploration for this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonios Georgiou, Tankut Can, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks</p>
<p>Abstract: The statistical study of human memory requires large-scale experiments, involving many stimuli conditions and test subjects. While this approach has proven to be quite fruitful for meaningless material such as random lists of words, naturalistic stimuli, like narratives, have until now resisted such a large-scale study, due to the quantity of manual labor required to design and analyze such experiments. In this work, we develop a pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) both to design naturalistic narrative stimuli for large-scale recall and recognition memory experiments, as well as to analyze the results. We performed online memory experiments with a large number of participants and collected recognition and recall data for narratives of different sizes. We found that both recall and recognition performance scale linearly with narrative length; however, for longer narratives people tend to summarize the content rather than recalling precise details. To investigate the role of narrative comprehension in memory, we repeated these experiments using scrambled versions of the narratives. Although recall performance declined significantly, recognition remained largely unaffected. Recalls in this condition seem to follow the original narrative order rather than the actual scrambled presentation, pointing to a contextual reconstruction of the story in memory. Finally, using LLM text embeddings, we construct a simple measure for each clause based on semantic similarity to the whole narrative, that shows a strong correlation with recall probability. Overall, our work demonstrates the power of LLMs in accessing new regimes in the study of human memory, as well as suggesting novel psychologically informed benchmarks for LLM performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of textual data presents substantial challenges in management and analysis, notably due to high storage and processing costs. Text classification, a vital aspect of text mining, provides robust solutions by enabling efficient categorization and organization of text data. These techniques allow individuals, researchers, and businesses to derive meaningful patterns and insights from large volumes of text. This survey paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy specifically designed for text classification based on research fields. The taxonomy is structured into hierarchical levels: research field-based category, research field-based sub-category, methodology-based technique, methodology sub-technique, and research field applications. We employ a dual evaluation approach: empirical and experimental. Empirically, we assess text classification techniques across four critical criteria. Experimentally, we compare and rank the methodology sub-techniques within the same methodology technique and within the same overall research field sub-category. This structured taxonomy, coupled with thorough evaluations, provides a detailed and nuanced understanding of text classification algorithms and their applications, empowering researchers to make informed decisions based on precise, field-specific insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Tian, Yikun Han, Xiusi Chen, Wei Wang, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferring the reasoning capability from stronger large language models (LLMs) to smaller ones has been quite appealing, as smaller LLMs are more flexible to deploy with less expense. Among the existing solutions, knowledge distillation stands out due to its outstanding efficiency and generalization. However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, including limited knowledge diversity and the lack of rich contextual information. To solve the problems and facilitate the learning of compact language models, we propose TinyLLM, a new knowledge distillation paradigm to learn a small student LLM from multiple large teacher LLMs. In particular, we encourage the student LLM to not only generate the correct answers but also understand the rationales behind these answers. Given that different LLMs possess diverse reasoning skills, we guide the student model to assimilate knowledge from various teacher LLMs. We further introduce an in-context example generator and a teacher-forcing Chain-of-Thought strategy to ensure that the rationales are accurate and grounded in contextually appropriate scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. Results show that TinyLLM can outperform large teacher LLMs significantly, despite a considerably smaller model size. The source code is available at: https://github.com/YikunHan42/TinyLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hazel Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Rationales behind answers not only explain model decisions but boost language models to reason well on complex reasoning tasks. However, obtaining impeccable rationales is often impossible. Besides, it is non-trivial to estimate the degree to which the rationales are faithful enough to encourage model performance. Thus, such reasoning tasks often compel models to output correct answers under undesirable rationales and are sub-optimal compared to what the models are fully capable of. In this work, we propose how to deal with imperfect rationales causing aleatoric uncertainty. We first define the ambiguous rationales with entropy scores of given rationales, using model prior beliefs as informativeness. We then guide models to select one of two different reasoning models according to the ambiguity of rationales. We empirically argue that our proposed method produces robust performance superiority against the adversarial quality of rationales and low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishnapriya Vishnubhotla, Daniela Teodorescu, Mallory J. Feldman, Kristen A. Lindquist, Saif M. Mohammad</p>
<p>Abstract: We are united in how emotions are central to shaping our experiences; and yet, individuals differ greatly in how we each identify, categorize, and express emotions. In psychology, variation in the ability of individuals to differentiate between emotion concepts is called emotion granularity (determined through self-reports of one's emotions). High emotion granularity has been linked with better mental and physical health; whereas low emotion granularity has been linked with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and poor health outcomes. In this work, we propose computational measures of emotion granularity derived from temporally-ordered speaker utterances in social media (in lieu of self-reports that suffer from various biases). We then investigate the effectiveness of such text-derived measures of emotion granularity in functioning as markers of various mental health conditions (MHCs). We establish baseline measures of emotion granularity derived from textual utterances, and show that, at an aggregate level, emotion granularities are significantly lower for people self-reporting as having an MHC than for the control population. This paves the way towards a better understanding of the MHCs, and specifically the role emotions play in our well-being.</p>

<p>Abstract: The existing methods for evaluating the inference abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been predominantly results-centric, making it challenging to assess the inference process comprehensively. We introduce a novel approach using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark to evaluate the inference and contextual understanding abilities of LLMs in a process-centric manner, focusing on three key components from the Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH): Logical Coherence, Compositionality, and Productivity. Our carefully designed experiments reveal that while LLMs demonstrate some inference capabilities, they still significantly lag behind human-level reasoning in these three aspects. The main contribution of this paper lies in introducing the LoTH perspective, which provides a method for evaluating the reasoning process that conventional results-oriented approaches fail to capture, thereby offering new insights into the development of human-level reasoning in artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07921">AmpleGCG: Learning a Universal and Transferable Generative Model of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking Both Open and Closed LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Liao, Huan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent and integrated into autonomous systems, ensuring their safety is imperative. Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete token optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps. Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100\% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99\% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5. To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. In addition, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozheng Fan, Hao Zhou, Guangtai Huang, Parameswaran Raman, Xinwei Fu, Gaurav Gupta, Dhananjay Ram, Yida Wang, Jun Huan</p>
<p>Abstract: Getting large language models (LLMs) to perform well on the downstream tasks requires pre-training over trillions of tokens. This typically demands a large number of powerful computational devices in addition to a stable distributed training framework to accelerate the training. The growing number of applications leveraging AI/ML led to a scarcity of the expensive conventional accelerators (such as GPUs), which emphasizes the need for the alternative specialized-accelerators that are scalable and cost-efficient. AWS Trainium is the second-generation machine learning accelerator purposely built for training large deep learning models. However, training LLMs with billions of parameters on AWS Trainium is challenging due to its relatively nascent software ecosystem. In this paper, we showcase HLAT: a family of 7B and 70B decoder-only LLMs pre-trained using 4096 AWS Trainium accelerators over 1.8 trillion tokens. The performance of HLAT is benchmarked against popular open source models including LLaMA and OpenLLaMA, which have been trained on NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs, respectively. On various evaluation tasks, we show that HLAT achieves model quality on par with the baselines of similar model size. We also open-source all the training scripts and configurations of HLAT (https://github.com/awslabs/HLAT) and share the best practice of using the NeuronX Distributed Training (NxDT), a customized distributed training library for AWS Trainium. Our work demonstrates that AWS Trainium powered by NxDT is able to successfully pre-train state-of-the-art LLM models with high performance and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ge Gao, Alexey Taymanov, Eduardo Salinas, Paul Mineiro, Dipendra Misra</p>
<p>Abstract: We study interactive learning of LLM-based language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data. The inferred user preference descriptions are used to define prompts for generating responses in the future. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex, subtle, and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages the LLM to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, and use a GPT-4 simulated user for evaluation. On both tasks, CIPHER outperforms several baselines by achieving the lowest edit distance cost while only having a small overhead in LLM query cost. Our analysis reports that user preferences learned by CIPHER show significant similarity to the ground truth latent preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugh Zhang, Jeff Da, Dean Lee, Vaughn Robinson, Catherine Wu, Will Song, Tiffany Zhao, Pranav Raja, Charlotte Zhuang, Dylan Slack, Qin Lyu, Sean Hendryx, Russell Kaplan, Michele Lunati, Summer Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 8%, with several families of models showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2 = 0.36) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that some models may have partially memorized GSM8k. Nevertheless, many models, especially those on the frontier, show minimal signs of overfitting, and all models broadly demonstrate generalization to novel math problems guaranteed to not be in their training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Zhao, Taotian Pang, Chunhui Li, Zhen Wu, Junjie Guo, Shangyu Xing, Xinyu Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely regarded as crucial in the exploration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The core of MLLMs lies in their capability to achieve cross-modal alignment. To attain this goal, current MLLMs typically follow a two-phase training paradigm: the pre-training phase and the instruction-tuning phase. Despite their success, there are shortcomings in the modeling of alignment capabilities within these models. Firstly, during the pre-training phase, the model usually assumes that all image-text pairs are uniformly aligned, but in fact the degree of alignment between different image-text pairs is inconsistent. Secondly, the instructions currently used for finetuning incorporate a variety of tasks and different tasks usually require different levels of alignment capabilities, but previous MLLMs overlook these differentiated alignment needs. To tackle these issues, we propose a new multimodal large language model AlignGPT. In the pre-training stage, instead of treating all image-text pairs equally, we divide them into different groups according to the degrees of alignment of them. Then, the model is trained to learn the representations of different alignment levels. In the instruction-tuning phase, we adaptively combine these representations of alignment levels to meet the dynamic alignment needs of different tasks. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance on 12 benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Dai, Sarvnaz Karimi, Abeed Sarker, Ben Hachey, Cecile Paris</p>
<p>Abstract: Active adverse event surveillance monitors Adverse Drug Events (ADE) from different data sources, such as electronic health records, medical literature, social media and search engine logs. Over the years, many datasets have been created, and shared tasks have been organised to facilitate active adverse event surveillance. However, most - if not all - datasets or shared tasks focus on extracting ADEs from a particular type of text. Domain generalisation - the ability of a machine learning model to perform well on new, unseen domains (text types) - is under-explored. Given the rapid advancements in natural language processing, one unanswered question is how far we are from having a single ADE extraction model that is effective on various types of text, such as scientific literature and social media posts. We contribute to answering this question by building a multi-domain benchmark for adverse drug event extraction, which we named MultiADE. The new benchmark comprises several existing datasets sampled from different text types and our newly created dataset - CADECv2, which is an extension of CADEC, covering online posts regarding more diverse drugs than CADEC. Our new dataset is carefully annotated by human annotators following detailed annotation guidelines. Our benchmark results show that the generalisation of the trained models is far from perfect, making it infeasible to be deployed to process different types of text. In addition, although intermediate transfer learning is a promising approach to utilising existing resources, further investigation is needed on methods of domain adaptation, particularly cost-effective methods to select useful training instances. The newly created CADECv2 and the scripts for building the benchmark are publicly available at CSIRO's Data Portal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kerim B\"uy\"ukaky\"uz</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. However, the computational cost and convergence times associated with fine-tuning these models remain significant challenges. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising method to mitigate these issues by introducing efficient fine-tuning techniques with a reduced number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we present OLoRA, an enhancement to the LoRA method that leverages orthonormal matrix initialization through QR decomposition. OLoRA significantly accelerates the convergence of LLM training while preserving the efficiency benefits of LoRA, such as the number of trainable parameters and GPU memory footprint. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that OLoRA not only converges faster but also exhibits improved performance compared to standard LoRA across a variety of language modeling tasks. This advancement opens new avenues for more efficient and accessible fine-tuning of LLMs, potentially enabling broader adoption and innovation in natural language applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuofeng Li, Zixing Gou, Xiangnan Zhang, Zhongyuan Liu, Sirui Li, Yuntong Hu, Chen Ling, Zheng Zhang, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) augment graph structures with natural language descriptions, facilitating detailed depictions of data and their interconnections across various real-world settings. However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks. The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository on Github, accessible at https://github.com/Zhuofeng-Li/TEG-Benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefei Ning, Zifu Wang, Shiyao Li, Zinan Lin, Peiran Yao, Tianyu Fu, Matthew B. Blaschko, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching to improve student models (e.g., knowledge distillation) is an extensively studied methodology in LLMs. However, for humans, teaching improves not only students but also teachers, by fostering more rigorous and clear reasoning as well as knowledge building. We ask: Can LLMs also learn by teaching (LbT) for better reasoning? If the answer is yes, we can potentially unlock the possibility of continuously advancing the models without solely relying on human-produced data or stronger models. In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration on this question. We show that LbT ideas can be incorporated into existing LLM training/prompting pipelines and bring improvements. Specifically, we design three methods, each mimicking one of the three levels of LbT: observing students' feedback, learning from the feedback, and learning iteratively, with the goals of improving answer accuracy without training or improving models' inherent capability with fine-tuning. We reveal some findings: (1) Teaching materials that make it easier for students to learn have clearer and more accurate logic when using in-context learning as the student's "learning" method; (2) Weak-to-strong generalization: LbT might help improve strong models by teaching weak models; (3) Diversity in students might help: teaching multiple students could be better than teaching one student or the teacher itself. We hope that our exploration can inspire future research on LbT and more broadly adopting the advanced techniques in education to improve LLMs. The code and website are at https://github.com/imagination-research/lbt and https://sites.google.com/view/llm-learning-by-teaching.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding whether a generated table is of good quality is important to be able to use it in creating or editing documents using automatic methods. In this work, we underline that existing measures for table quality evaluation fail to capture the overall semantics of the tables, and sometimes unfairly penalize good tables and reward bad ones. We propose TabEval, a novel table evaluation strategy that captures table semantics by first breaking down a table into a list of natural language atomic statements and then compares them with ground truth statements using entailment-based measures. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of text descriptions for 1,250 diverse Wikipedia tables, covering a range of topics and structures, in contrast to the limited scope of existing datasets. We compare TabEval with existing metrics using unsupervised and supervised text-to-table generation methods, demonstrating its stronger correlation with human judgments of table quality across four datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Kumar Lal, Vanya Cohen, Nathanael Chambers, Niranjan Balasubramanian, Raymond Mooney</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the abilities of LLMs to reason about natural language plans, such as instructional text and recipes, is critical to reliably using them in decision-making systems. A fundamental aspect of plans is the temporal order in which their steps needs to be executed, which reflects the underlying causal dependencies between them. We introduce CaT-Bench, a benchmark of Step Order Prediction questions, which test whether a step must necessarily occur before or after another in cooking recipe plans. We use this to evaluate how well frontier LLMs understand causal and temporal dependencies. We find that SOTA LLMs are underwhelming (best zero-shot is only 0.59 in F1), and are biased towards predicting dependence more often, perhaps relying on temporal order of steps as a heuristic. While prompting for explanations and using few-shot examples improve performance, the best F1 result is only 0.73. Further, human evaluation of explanations along with answer correctness show that, on average, humans do not agree with model reasoning. Surprisingly, we also find that explaining after answering leads to better performance than normal chain-of-thought prompting, and LLM answers are not consistent across questions about the same step pairs. Overall, results show that LLMs' ability to detect dependence between steps has significant room for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingdong Li, Zixiang Di, Yanting Yang, Hong Qian, Peng Yang, Hao Hao, Ke Tang, Aimin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for addressing the multi-objective optimization problem in large language model merging via black-box multi-objective optimization algorithms. The goal of model merging is to combine multiple models, each excelling in different tasks, into a single model that outperforms any of the individual source models. However, model merging faces two significant challenges: First, existing methods rely heavily on human knowledge or intuition. Second, it's difficult to obtain the great model merging configuration in limited evaluations. To address these challenges, we formalize model merging as a multi-objective optimization problem and propose an automated optimization approach named MM-MO. This method leverages multi-objective optimization algorithms to autonomously search for optimal merging configurations across various tasks, alleviating the need for human intervention. In MM-MO, a weak-to-strong method is employed to enhance the acquisition function, allowing previously evaluated superior configurations to guide the search for new ones. Meanwhile, Fisher information is applied to screen these configurations, increasing the possibility of identifying high-quality merging configuration. Additionally, we designed a sparsity metric as an additional optimization objective to enhance the model's generalization performance across different tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments with other mainstream model merging methods, demonstrating that the proposed MM-MO algorithm is competitive and effective in achieving high-quality model merging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Barriere, Sebastian Cifuentes</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we apply a method to quantify biases associated with named entities from various countries. We create counterfactual examples with small perturbations on target-domain data instead of relying on templates or specific datasets for bias detection. On widely used classifiers for subjectivity analysis, including sentiment, emotion, hate speech, and offensive text using Twitter data, our results demonstrate positive biases related to the language spoken in a country across all classifiers studied. Notably, the presence of certain country names in a sentence can strongly influence predictions, up to a 23\% change in hate speech detection and up to a 60\% change in the prediction of negative emotions such as anger. We hypothesize that these biases stem from the training data of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and find correlations between affect predictions and PLMs likelihood in English and unknown languages like Basque and Maori, revealing distinct patterns with exacerbate correlations. Further, we followed these correlations in-between counterfactual examples from a same sentence to remove the syntactical component, uncovering interesting results suggesting the impact of the pre-training data was more important for English-speaking-country names.

Along with our novel dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models to be used as baselines for future research.

Further investigations based on few-shot prompting the Falcon-7B Large Language Model also point in the same direction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wang, Antonis Antoniades, Yanai Elazar, Alfonso Amayuelas, Alon Albalak, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor Ryazanov, Carl \"Ohman, Johanna Bj\"orklund</p>
<p>Abstract: We perform a mixed-method frame semantics-based analysis on a dataset of more than 49,000 sentences collected from 5846 news articles that mention AI. The dataset covers the twelve-month period centred around the launch of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT and is collected from the most visited open-access English-language news publishers. Our findings indicate that during the six months succeeding the launch, media attention rose tenfold$\unicode{x2014}$from already historically high levels. During this period, discourse has become increasingly centred around experts and political leaders, and AI has become more closely associated with dangers and risks. A deeper review of the data also suggests a qualitative shift in the types of threat AI is thought to represent, as well as the anthropomorphic qualities ascribed to it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mara Finkelstein, David Vilar, Markus Freitag</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research in neural machine translation (NMT) has shown that training on high-quality machine-generated data can outperform training on human-generated data. This work accompanies the first-ever release of a LLM-generated, MBR-decoded and QE-reranked dataset with both sentence-level and multi-sentence examples. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of our dataset in terms of its downstream impact on NMT model performance. We find that training from scratch on our (machine-generated) dataset outperforms training on the (web-crawled) WMT'23 training dataset (which is 300 times larger), and also outperforms training on the top-quality subset of the WMT'23 training dataset. We also find that performing self-distillation by finetuning the LLM which generated this dataset outperforms the LLM's strong few-shot baseline. These findings corroborate the quality of our dataset, and demonstrate the value of high-quality machine-generated data in improving performance of NMT models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wang, Shuyu Kong, Li Wan, Biqiao Zhang, Yiteng Huang, Mumin Jin, Ming Sun, Xin Lei, Zhaojun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing keyword spotting (KWS) systems primarily rely on predefined keyword phrases. However, the ability to recognize customized keywords is crucial for tailoring interactions with intelligent devices. In this paper, we present a novel Query-by-Example (QbyE) KWS system that employs spectral-temporal graph attentive pooling and multi-task learning. This framework aims to effectively learn speaker-invariant and linguistic-informative embeddings for QbyE KWS tasks. Within this framework, we investigate three distinct network architectures for encoder modeling: LiCoNet, Conformer and ECAPA_TDNN. The experimental results on a substantial internal dataset of $629$ speakers have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed QbyE framework in maximizing the potential of simpler models such as LiCoNet. Particularly, LiCoNet, which is 13x more efficient, achieves comparable performance to the computationally intensive Conformer model (1.98% vs. 1.63\% FRR at 0.3 FAs/Hr).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Zhang, Genan Dai, Fuqiang Niu, Nan Yin, Xiaomao Fan, Senzhang Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Hu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern digital environments, users frequently express opinions on contentious topics, providing a wealth of information on prevailing attitudes. The systematic analysis of these opinions offers valuable insights for decision-making in various sectors, including marketing and politics. As a result, stance detection has emerged as a crucial subfield within affective computing, enabling the automatic detection of user stances in social media conversations and providing a nuanced understanding of public sentiment on complex issues. Recent years have seen a surge of research interest in developing effective stance detection methods, with contributions from multiple communities, including natural language processing, web science, and social computing. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of stance detection techniques on social media, covering task definitions, datasets, approaches, and future works. We review traditional stance detection models, as well as state-of-the-art methods based on large language models, and discuss their strengths and limitations. Our survey highlights the importance of stance detection in understanding public opinion and sentiment, and identifies gaps in current research. We conclude by outlining potential future directions for stance detection on social media, including the need for more robust and generalizable models, and the importance of addressing emerging challenges such as multi-modal stance detection and stance detection in low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengwei Tian, Lifeng Han, Goran Nenadic</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, a vast variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to emerge for diverse NLP tasks. As more papers are published, researchers and developers face the challenge of information overload. Thus, developing a system that can automatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic papers is particularly important. The standard format for documenting information about LLMs is the LLM model card (\textbf{LLM-Card}). We propose a method for automatically generating LLM model cards from scientific publications. We use Named Entity Recognition (\textbf{NER}) and Relation Extraction (\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information about LLMs from the papers, helping researchers to access information about LLMs efficiently. These features include model \textit{licence}, model \textit{name}, and model \textit{application}. With these features, we can form a model card for each paper. We processed 106 academic papers by defining three dictionaries -- LLM's name, licence, and application. 11,051 sentences were extracted through dictionary lookup, and the dataset was constructed through manual review of the final selection of 129 sentences with a link between the name and the \textit{licence}, and 106 sentences with a link between the model name and the \textit{application}. The resulting resource is relevant for LLM card illustrations using relational knowledge graphs. Our code and findings can contribute to automatic LLM card generation. Data and code in \textsc{autoLLM-Card} will be shared and freely available at \url{https://github.com/shengwei-tian/dependency-parser-visualization}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pritika Ramu, Koustava Goswami, Apoorv Saxena, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately attributing answer text to its source document is crucial for developing a reliable question-answering system. However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What exactly should be attributed? This involves identifying the specific information units within an answer that require grounding. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan T. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: This review examines theoretical assumptions and computational models of event comprehension, tracing the evolution from discourse comprehension theories to contemporary event cognition frameworks. The review covers key discourse comprehension accounts, including Construction-Integration, Event Indexing, Causal Network, and Resonance models, highlighting their contributions to understanding cognitive processes in comprehension. I then discuss contemporary theoretical frameworks of event comprehension, including Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks et al., 2007), the Event Horizon Model (Radvansky & Zacks, 2014), and Hierarchical Generative Framework (Kuperberg, 2021), which emphasize prediction, causality, and multilevel representations in event understanding. Building on these theories, I evaluate five computational models of event comprehension: REPRISE (Butz et al., 2019), Structured Event Memory (SEM; Franklin et al., 2020), the Lu model (Lu et al., 2022), the Gumbsch model (Gumbsch et al., 2022), and the Elman and McRae model (2019). The analysis focuses on their approaches to hierarchical processing, prediction mechanisms, and representation learning. Key themes that emerge include the use of hierarchical structures as inductive biases, the importance of prediction in comprehension, and diverse strategies for learning event dynamics. The review identifies critical areas for future research, including the need for more sophisticated approaches to learning structured representations, integrating episodic memory mechanisms, and developing adaptive updating algorithms for working event models. By synthesizing insights from both theoretical frameworks and computational implementations, this review aims to advance our understanding of human event comprehension and guide future modeling efforts in cognitive science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyue Li, Ziniu Zhang, Lu Wang, Hongyang R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of fine-tuning a language model (LM) for a target task by optimally using the information from $n$ auxiliary tasks. This problem has broad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data selection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is that not all auxiliary tasks are useful to improve the performance of the target task. Thus, choosing the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial. Conventional subset selection methods, such as forward and backward stepwise selection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated training on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm to estimate model fine-tuning performances without repeated training. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using the data of all the tasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model fine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the meta initialization. Empirically, we find that this gradient-based approximation holds with remarkable accuracy for twelve transformer-based LMs. Thus, we can now estimate fine-tuning performances on CPUs within a few seconds. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained base model for once on the selected subset of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to validate this approach, delivering a speedup of $30\times$ over conventional subset selection while incurring only $1\%$ error of the true fine-tuning performances. In downstream evaluations involving both instruction tuning and chain-of-thought fine-tuning, this loss-based selection approach improves over prior gradient or representation similarity-based methods for subset selection by up to $3.8\%$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhyun Oh, Eunsu Kim, Jiseon Kim, Wenda Xu, Inha Cha, William Yang Wang, Alice Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment, understanding the reasons behind LLM preferences remains crucial for bridging the gap between desired and actual behavior. LLMs often exhibit biases or tendencies that diverge from human preferences, such as favoring certain writing styles or producing overly verbose outputs. However, current methods for evaluating preference alignment often lack explainability, relying on coarse-grained comparisons. To address this, we introduce PROFILE (PRObing Factors of InfLuence for Explainability), a novel framework that uncovers and quantifies the influence of specific factors driving preferences. PROFILE's factor level analysis explains the 'why' behind human-model alignment and misalignment, offering insights into the direction of model improvement. We apply PROFILE to analyze human and LLM preferences across three tasks: summarization, helpful response generation, and document-based question-answering. Our factor level analysis reveals a substantial discrepancy between human and LLM preferences in generation tasks, whereas LLMs show strong alignment with human preferences in evaluation tasks. We demonstrate how leveraging factor level insights, including addressing misaligned factors or exploiting the generation-evaluation gap, can improve alignment with human preferences. This work underscores the importance of explainable preference analysis and highlights PROFILE's potential to provide valuable training signals, driving further improvements in human-model alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanqing Yu, Zhefan Wang, Weizhi Ma, Zhicheng Guo, Jingtao Zhan, Shuai Wang, Chuhan Wu, Zhiqiang Guo, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite having powerful reasoning and inference capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still need external tools to acquire real-time information retrieval or domain-specific expertise to solve complex tasks, which is referred to as tool learning. Existing tool learning methods primarily rely on tuning with expert trajectories, focusing on token-sequence learning from a linguistic perspective. However, there are several challenges: 1) imitating static trajectories limits their ability to generalize to new tasks. 2) even expert trajectories can be suboptimal, and better solution paths may exist. In this work, we introduce StepTool, a novel step-grained reinforcement learning framework to improve tool learning in LLMs. It consists of two components: Step-grained Reward Shaping, which assigns rewards at each tool interaction based on tool invocation success and its contribution to the task, and Step-grained Optimization, which uses policy gradient methods to optimize the model in a multi-step manner. Experimental results demonstrate that StepTool significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-step, tool-based tasks, providing a robust solution for complex task environments.

<p>Abstract: Stress detection is a critical area of research with significant implications for health monitoring and intervention systems. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable approach for video-based stress detection, leveraging self-refine chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance both accuracy and transparency in decision-making processes. Our method focuses on extracting subtle behavioral and physiological cues from video sequences that indicate stress levels. By incorporating a chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism, the system refines its predictions iteratively, ensuring that the decision-making process can be traced and explained. The model also learns to self-refine through feedback loops, improving its reasoning capabilities over time.
  We evaluate our approach on several public and private datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in comparison to traditional video-based stress detection methods. Additionally, we provide comprehensive insights into the interpretability of the model's predictions, making the system highly valuable for applications in both healthcare and human-computer interaction domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Zhao, Zhiyuan Ji, Yuchen Feng, Pengnian Qi, Simin Niu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To implement Meta-Chunking, we designed Perplexity (PPL) Chunking, which balances performance and speed, and precisely identifies the boundaries of text chunks by analyzing the characteristics of context perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines PPL Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8% of the time. Furthermore, through the analysis of models of various scales and types, we observed that PPL Chunking exhibits notable flexibility and adaptability.

<p>Abstract: Building on the success of large language models (LLMs), recent advancements such as GPT-4o have enabled real-time speech interactions through LLM-based voice assistants, offering a significantly improved user experience compared to traditional text-based interactions. However, the absence of benchmarks designed to evaluate these speech interaction capabilities has hindered progress of LLM-based voice assistants development. Current evaluations focus primarily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or general knowledge evaluation with clean speeches, neglecting the more intricate, real-world scenarios that involve diverse speaker characteristics, environmental and content factors. To address this, we introduce VoiceBench, the first benchmark designed to provide a multi-faceted evaluation of LLM-based voice assistants. VoiceBench also includes both real and synthetic spoken instructions that incorporate the above three key real-world variations. Extensive experiments reveal the limitations of current LLM-based voice assistant models and offer valuable insights for future research and development in this field.</p>

We demonstrate that contextual text representations enhance GNN performance, achieving 33.8% relative improvement in Macro F1 over models without textual features and 9.3% over static text representations. We further investigate the impact of different feature sources and the effects of noisy data augmentation.

To this end, we introduce AgentSense: Benchmarking Social Intelligence of Language Agents through Interactive Scenarios. Drawing on Dramaturgical Theory, AgentSense employs a bottom-up approach to create 1,225 diverse social scenarios constructed from extensive scripts. We evaluate LLM-driven agents through multi-turn interactions, emphasizing both goal completion and implicit reasoning. We analyze goals using ERG theory and conduct comprehensive experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Xiaogeng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), enabling goal hijacking and data leakage. Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense -- falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose InjecGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words. InjecGuard demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks including NotInject, surpassing the existing best model by 30.8%, offering a robust and open-source solution for detecting prompt injection attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The generic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many ontology matching (OM) systems. However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on OM tasks at syntactic levels. Our experiments on 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) track repositories with 49 distinct alignments indicate: (1) Tokenisation and Normalisation are currently more effective than Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation; and (2) The selection of Lemmatisation and Stemming is task-specific. We recommend standalone Lemmatisation or Stemming with post-hoc corrections. We find that (3) Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer perform better than Lancaster Stemmer; and that (4) Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging does not help Lemmatisation. To repair less effective Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation used in OM tasks, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that significantly improves matching correctness and overall matching performance. We also discuss the use of text preprocessing pipeline in the new era of large language models (LLMs).</p>

<p>Abstract: Thanks to unprecedented language understanding and generation capabilities of large language model (LLM), Retrieval-augmented Code Generation (RaCG) has recently been widely utilized among software developers. While this has increased productivity, there are still frequent instances of incorrect codes being provided. In particular, there are cases where plausible yet incorrect codes are generated for queries from users that cannot be answered with the given queries and API descriptions. This study proposes a task for evaluating answerability, which assesses whether valid answers can be generated based on users' queries and retrieved APIs in RaCG. Additionally, we build a benchmark dataset called Retrieval-augmented Code Generability Evaluation (RaCGEval) to evaluate the performance of models performing this task. Experimental results show that this task remains at a very challenging level, with baseline models exhibiting a low performance of 46.7%. Furthermore, this study discusses methods that could significantly improve performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shauli Ravfogel, Anej Svete, V\'esteinn Sn{\ae}bjarnarson, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to intervene on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as Generalized Structural-equation. Models using the Gumbel-max trick. This allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyi Kong, Ziyang Luo, Hongzhan Lin, Zhiyuan Fan, Yaxin Fan, Yuxi Sun, Jing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The advanced role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for developing Role-Playing Agents (RPAs). However, existing benchmarks in this domain, such as HPD and SocialBench face limitations like poor generalizability, implicit and inaccurate judgments, and the risk of model forgetting. To address the above issues, we propose an automatic, scalable, and generalizable paradigm. Specifically, we construct a benchmark, SHARP, by extracting relations from a general knowledge graph and leveraging the inherent hallucination properties of RPAs to simulate interactions across roles. We employ ChatGPT for stance detection and define relationship hallucination along with three related metrics based on stance transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and stability of our paradigm. Our findings further explore the factors influencing these metrics and discuss the trade-off between blind loyalty to relationships and adherence to facts in RPAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Cheng, Zefan Zeng, Xingchen Hu, Yuehang Si, Zhong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has become a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), aimed at automatically extracting causalities from textual data. In this survey, we systematically address the foundational principles, technical frameworks, and challenges of ECI, offering a comprehensive taxonomy to categorize and clarify current research methodologies, as well as a quantitative assessment of existing models. We first establish a conceptual framework for ECI, outlining key definitions, problem formulations, and evaluation standards. Our taxonomy classifies ECI methods according to the two primary tasks of sentence-level (SECI) and document-level (DECI) event causality identification. For SECI, we examine feature pattern-based matching, deep semantic encoding, causal knowledge pre-training and prompt-based fine-tuning, and external knowledge enhancement methods. For DECI, we highlight approaches focused on event graph reasoning and prompt-based techniques to address the complexity of cross-sentence causal inference. Additionally, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and open challenges of each approach. We further conduct an extensive quantitative evaluation of various ECI methods on two benchmark datasets. Finally, we explore future research directions, highlighting promising pathways to overcome current limitations and broaden ECI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Xu, Yiguan Lin, Yinghao Li, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate exceptional performance in simple code generation tasks but still face challenges in tackling complex problems. These challenges may stem from insufficient reasoning and problem decomposition capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning-augmented data generation process, SRA-MCTS, which guides the model to autonomously generate high-quality intermediate reasoning paths. This creates a positive feedback loop, enabling continuous improvement. Our method operates entirely through the model itself without requiring additional supervision. By synthesizing natural language reasoning paths and translating them into executable code, the approach ensures analytical accuracy and enhances the success rate in solving complex tasks. Experimental results show that, even without additional supervisory signals, our method achieves performance improvements across different model scales, demonstrating the significant potential of self-improvement in small models. Furthermore, the method remains robust when traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches exhibit performance degradation, with notable improvements observed in diversity metrics such as pass@10. We encourage further exploration of reasoning processes within training data to enhance the ability of language models to address complex problems. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/DIRECT-BIT/SRA-MCTS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keer Lu, Keshi Zhao, Zheng Liang, Da Pan, Shusen Zhang, Xin Wu, Weipeng Chen, Zenan Zhou, Guosheng Dong, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in handling multiple tasks across domains due to their emergent properties. These capabilities are further augmented during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. Despite their potential, existing work mainly focuses on domain-specific enhancements during fine-tuning, the challenge of which lies in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge across other domains. In this study, we introduce VersaTune, a novel data composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-ability performances during fine-tuning. We categorize knowledge into distinct domains including law, medicine, finance, science, code. We begin with detecting the distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed by the composition of training data that aligns with the model's existing knowledge distribution. During the fine-tuning process, weights of different domains are dynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaTune achieves significant improvements in multi-domain performance, with a 35.21% enhancement in comprehensive multi-domain tasks. Additionally, in scenarios where specific domain optimization is required, VersaTune reduces the degradation of performance in other domains by 38.77%, without compromising the target domain's training efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) for social media platforms (i.e., X, Reddit) with more realistic large language model (LLM) agents, thereby allowing for a more nuanced study of complex systems. As a result, several LLM-based ABMs have been proposed in the past year. While they hold promise, each simulator is specifically designed to study a particular scenario, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive to explore other phenomena using the same ABM. Additionally, these models simulate only a limited number of agents, whereas real-world social media platforms involve millions of users. To this end, we propose OASIS, a generalizable and scalable social media simulator. OASIS is designed based on real-world social media platforms, incorporating dynamically updated environments (i.e., dynamic social networks and post information), diverse action spaces (i.e., following, commenting), and recommendation systems (i.e., interest-based and hot-score-based). Additionally, OASIS supports large-scale user simulations, capable of modeling up to one million users. With these features, OASIS can be easily extended to different social media platforms to study large-scale group phenomena and behaviors. We replicate various social phenomena, including information spreading, group polarization, and herd effects across X and Reddit platforms. Moreover, we provide observations of social phenomena at different agent group scales. We observe that the larger agent group scale leads to more enhanced group dynamics and more diverse and helpful agents' opinions. These findings demonstrate OASIS's potential as a powerful tool for studying complex systems in digital environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hubert Plisiecki</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Semantic Propagation Graph Neural Network (SProp GNN), a machine learning sentiment analysis (SA) architecture that relies exclusively on syntactic structures and word-level emotional cues to predict emotions in text. By semantically blinding the model to information about specific words, it is robust to biases such as political or gender bias that have been plaguing previous machine learning-based SA systems. The SProp GNN shows performance superior to lexicon-based alternatives such as VADER and EmoAtlas on two different prediction tasks, and across two languages. Additionally, it approaches the accuracy of transformer-based models while significantly reducing bias in emotion prediction tasks. By offering improved explainability and reducing bias, the SProp GNN bridges the methodological gap between interpretable lexicon approaches and powerful, yet often opaque, deep learning models, offering a robust tool for fair and effective emotion analysis in understanding human behavior through text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sign language processing technology development relies on extensive and reliable datasets, instructions, and ethical guidelines. We present a comprehensive Azerbaijani Sign Language Dataset (AzSLD) collected from diverse sign language users and linguistic parameters to facilitate advancements in sign recognition and translation systems and support the local sign language community. The dataset was created within the framework of a vision-based AzSL translation project. This study introduces the dataset as a summary of the fingerspelling alphabet and sentence- and word-level sign language datasets. The dataset was collected from signers of different ages, genders, and signing styles, with videos recorded from two camera angles to capture each sign in full detail. This approach ensures robust training and evaluation of gesture recognition models. AzSLD contains 30,000 videos, each carefully annotated with accurate sign labels and corresponding linguistic translations. The dataset is accompanied by technical documentation and source code to facilitate its use in training and testing. This dataset offers a valuable resource of labeled data for researchers and developers working on sign language recognition, translation, or synthesis. Ethical guidelines were strictly followed throughout the project, with all participants providing informed consent for collecting, publishing, and using the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheni Zeng, Yuxuan Chen, Shi Yu, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can utilize techniques to quickly acquire knowledge from specific materials in advance, such as creating self-assessment questions, enabling us to achieving related tasks more efficiently. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) usually relies on retrieval-augmented generation to exploit knowledge materials in an instant manner, or requires external signals such as human preference data and stronger LLM annotations to conduct knowledge adaptation. To unleash the self-learning potential of LLMs, we propose KBAlign, an approach designed for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks involving knowledge bases. Our method utilizes iterative training with self-annotated data such as Q&A pairs and revision suggestions, enabling the model to grasp the knowledge content efficiently. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly boosting model performance in downstream tasks that require specific knowledge at a low cost. Notably, our approach achieves over 90% of the performance improvement that can be obtained by using GPT-4-turbo annotation, while relying entirely on self-supervision. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (https://github.com/thunlp/KBAlign).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Bhattacharyya, Anurag Tripathi</p>
<p>Abstract: Invoices and receipts submitted by employees are visually rich documents (VRDs) with textual, visual and layout information. To protect against the risk of fraud and abuse, it is crucial for organizations to efficiently extract desired information from submitted receipts. This helps in the assessment of key factors such as appropriateness of the expense claim, adherence to spending and transaction policies, the validity of the receipt, as well as downstream anomaly detection at various levels. These documents are heterogeneous, with multiple formats and languages, uploaded with different image qualities, and often do not contain ground truth labels for the efficient training of models. In this paper we propose Task Aware Instruction-based Labelling (TAIL), a method for synthetic label generation in VRD corpuses without labels, and fine-tune a multimodal Visually Rich Document Understanding Model (VRDU) on TAIL labels using response-based knowledge distillation without using the teacher model's weights or training dataset to conditionally generate annotations in the appropriate format. Using a benchmark external dataset where ground truth labels are available, we demonstrate conditions under which our approach performs at par with Claude 3 Sonnet through empirical studies. We then show that the resulting model performs at par or better on the internal expense documents of a large multinational organization than state-of-the-art LMM (large multimodal model) Claude 3 Sonnet while being 85% less costly and ~5X faster, and outperforms layout-aware baselines by more than 10% in Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) scores due to its ability to reason and extract information from rare formats. Finally, we illustrate the usage of our approach in overpayment prevention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Rajaram, Puneet Manchanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Influencer marketing videos have surged in popularity, yet significant gaps remain in understanding the relationships between video features and engagement. This challenge is intensified by the complexities of interpreting unstructured data. While deep learning models effectively leverage raw unstructured data to predict engagement, they often function as black boxes with limited interpretability, particularly when human validation is hindered by the absence of a known ground truth. To address this issue, we develop an 'interpretable deep learning framework' that provides insights into the relationships captured by the models. Inspired by visual attention in print advertising, our interpretation approach uses measures of model attention to video features, eliminating spurious associations through a two-step process and identifying a subset of relationships for formal causal testing. This approach is versatile, as it applies across well-known attention mechanisms - additive attention, scaled dot-product attention, and gradient-based attention - when analyzing text, audio, or video image data. We apply our framework to YouTube influencer videos, linking video features to measures of shallow and deep engagement developed based on the dual-system framework of thinking. Our findings guide influencers in prioritizing the design of video features associated with deep engagement sentiment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Ochieng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion based vocoders have been criticised for being slow due to the many steps required during sampling. Moreover, the model's loss function that is popularly implemented is designed such that the target is the original input $x_0$ or error $\epsilon_0$. For early time steps of the reverse process, this results in large prediction errors, which can lead to speech distortions and increase the learning time. We propose a setup where the targets are the different outputs of forward process time steps with a goal to reduce the magnitude of prediction errors and reduce the training time. We use the different layers of a neural network (NN) to perform denoising by training them to learn to generate representations similar to the noised outputs in the forward process of the diffusion. The NN layers learn to progressively denoise the input in the reverse process until finally the final layer estimates the clean speech. To avoid 1:1 mapping between layers of the neural network and the forward process steps, we define a skip parameter $\tau>1$ such that an NN layer is trained to cumulatively remove the noise injected in the $\tau$ steps in the forward process. This significantly reduces the number of data distribution recovery steps and, consequently, the time to generate speech. We show through extensive evaluation that the proposed technique generates high-fidelity speech in competitive time that outperforms current state-of-the-art tools. The proposed technique is also able to generalize well to unseen speech.</p>

<p>Abstract: A prompt injection attack aims to inject malicious instruction/data into the input of an LLM-Integrated Application such that it produces results as an attacker desires. Existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks are special cases in our framework. Moreover, based on our framework, we design a new attack by combining existing ones. Using our framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation on 5 prompt injection attacks and 10 defenses with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. Our work provides a common benchmark for quantitatively evaluating future prompt injection attacks and defenses.

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated Large Language Models (LLMs) can extend their zero-shot generalization capabilities to multimodal learning through instruction tuning. As more modalities and downstream tasks are introduced, negative conflicts and interference may have a worse impact on performance. While this phenomenon has been overlooked in previous work, we propose a novel and extensible framework, called Octavius, for comprehensive studies and experimentation on multimodal learning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we combine the well-known Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and one of the representative PEFT techniques, i.e., LoRA, designing a novel LLM-based decoder, called LoRA-MoE, for multimodal learning. To the best of our knowledge, we are one of the pioneering efforts to introduce MoE into MLLMs to address this problem. The experimental results (about 20% improvement) have shown the effectiveness and versatility of our design in various 2D and 3D downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Buckley, James A. Diao, Pranav Rajpurkar, Adam Rodman, Arjun K. Manrai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have shown compelling but conflicting performance in medical image interpretation. However, the mechanisms by which these models integrate and prioritize different data modalities, including images and text, remain poorly understood. Here, using a diverse collection of 1014 multimodal medical cases, we evaluate the unimodal and multimodal image interpretation abilities of proprietary (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0) and open-source (Llama-3.2-90B, LLaVA-Med-v1.5) multimodal foundational models with and without the use of text descriptions. Across all models, image predictions were largely driven by exploiting text, with accuracy increasing monotonically with the amount of informative text. By contrast, human performance on medical image interpretation did not improve with informative text. Exploitation of text is a double-edged sword; we show that even mild suggestions of an incorrect diagnosis in text diminishes image-based classification, reducing performance dramatically in cases the model could previously answer with images alone. Finally, we conducted a physician evaluation of model performance on long-form medical cases, finding that the provision of images either reduced or had no effect on model performance when text is already highly informative. Our results suggest that multimodal AI models may be useful in medical diagnostic reasoning but that their accuracy is largely driven, for better and worse, by their exploitation of text.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the training dynamics of neural networks in a structured non-IID setting where documents are presented cyclically in a fixed, repeated sequence. Typically, networks suffer from catastrophic interference when training on a sequence of documents; however, we discover a curious and remarkable property of LLMs finetuned sequentially in this setting: they exhibit anticipatory behavior, recovering from the forgetting on documents before encountering them again. This behavior occurs even though the documents are never presented in context together. The behavior emerges and becomes more robust as the architecture scales up its number of parameters. Through comprehensive experiments and visualizations, we demonstrate a new mechanism by which over-parametrized neural networks can recover from catastrophic interference and uncover new insights into training over-parameterized networks in cyclically structured environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The diffusion model has long been plagued by scalability and quadratic complexity issues, especially within transformer-based structures. In this study, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of a State-Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to visual data generation. Firstly, we identify a critical oversight in most current Mamba-based vision methods, namely the lack of consideration for spatial continuity in the scan scheme of Mamba. Secondly, building upon this insight, we introduce a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter method named Zigzag Mamba, which outperforms Mamba-based baselines and demonstrates improved speed and memory utilization compared to transformer-based baselines. Lastly, we integrate Zigzag Mamba with the Stochastic Interpolant framework to investigate the scalability of the model on large-resolution visual datasets, such as FacesHQ $1024\times 1024$ and UCF101, MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, and MS COCO $256\times 256$ .

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weidi Luo, Siyuan Ma, Xiaogeng Liu, Xiaoyu Guo, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), securing these models against malicious inputs while aligning them with human values has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate an important and unexplored question of whether techniques that successfully jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) can be equally effective in jailbreaking MLLMs. To explore this issue, we introduce JailBreakV-28K, a pioneering benchmark designed to assess the transferability of LLM jailbreak techniques to MLLMs, thereby evaluating the robustness of MLLMs against diverse jailbreak attacks. Utilizing a dataset of 2, 000 malicious queries that is also proposed in this paper, we generate 20, 000 text-based jailbreak prompts using advanced jailbreak attacks on LLMs, alongside 8, 000 image-based jailbreak inputs from recent MLLMs jailbreak attacks, our comprehensive dataset includes 28, 000 test cases across a spectrum of adversarial scenarios. Our evaluation of 10 open-source MLLMs reveals a notably high Attack Success Rate (ASR) for attacks transferred from LLMs, highlighting a critical vulnerability in MLLMs that stems from their text-processing capabilities. Our findings underscore the urgent need for future research to address alignment vulnerabilities in MLLMs from both textual and visual inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Qiu, Weichao Mao, Archit Patke, Shengkun Cui, Saurabh Jha, Chen Wang, Hubertus Franke, Zbigniew T. Kalbarczyk, Tamer Ba\c{s}ar, Ravishankar K. Iyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been driving a new wave of interactive AI applications across numerous domains. However, efficiently serving LLM inference requests is challenging due to their unpredictable execution times originating from the autoregressive nature of generative models. Existing LLM serving systems exploit first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling, suffering from head-of-line blocking issues. To address the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and enable efficient interactive LLM serving, we present a speculative shortest-job-first (SSJF) scheduler that uses a light proxy model to predict LLM output sequence lengths. Our open-source SSJF implementation does not require changes to memory management or batching strategies. Evaluations on real-world datasets and production workload traces show that SSJF reduces average job completion times by 30.5-39.6% and increases throughput by 2.2-3.6x compared to FCFS schedulers, across no batching, dynamic batching, and continuous batching settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haizhou Shi, Zihao Xu, Hengyi Wang, Weiyi Qin, Wenyuan Wang, Yibin Wang, Zifeng Wang, Sayna Ebrahimi, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences. Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5). Finally, we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6). The full list of papers examined in this survey is available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/llm-continual-learning-survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Chuanyang Jin, Jingyu Liu, Kunlun Zhu, Haoqin Tu, Zirui Cheng, Guanyu Lin, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly impacted human society, driving significant advancements in multiple sectors. AGI, distinguished by its ability to execute diverse real-world tasks with efficiency and effectiveness comparable to human intelligence, reflects a paramount milestone in AI evolution. While existing studies have reviewed specific advancements in AI and proposed potential paths to AGI, such as large language models (LLMs), they fall short of providing a thorough exploration of AGI's definitions, objectives, and developmental trajectories. Unlike previous survey papers, this work goes beyond summarizing LLMs by addressing key questions about our progress toward AGI and outlining the strategies essential for its realization through comprehensive analysis, in-depth discussions, and novel insights. We start by articulating the requisite capability frameworks for AGI, integrating the internal, interface, and system dimensions. As the realization of AGI requires more advanced capabilities and adherence to stringent constraints, we further discuss necessary AGI alignment technologies to harmonize these factors. Notably, we emphasize the importance of approaching AGI responsibly by first defining the key levels of AGI progression, followed by the evaluation framework that situates the status quo, and finally giving our roadmap of how to reach the pinnacle of AGI. Moreover, to give tangible insights into the ubiquitous impact of the integration of AI, we outline existing challenges and potential pathways toward AGI in multiple domains. In sum, serving as a pioneering exploration into the current state and future trajectory of AGI, this paper aims to foster a collective comprehension and catalyze broader public discussions among researchers and practitioners on AGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Hu, Xibin Wu, Zilin Zhu,  Xianyu, Weixun Wang, Dehao Zhang, Yu Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow by scaling laws, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained significant attention due to its outstanding performance. However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques. Empowering state-of-the-art LLM development, OpenRLHF's code is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihe Deng, Pan Lu, Fan Yin, Ziniu Hu, Sheng Shen, Quanquan Gu, James Zou, Kai-Wei Chang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLMs) integrate large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained vision encoders, thereby activating the perception capability of the model to understand image inputs for different queries and conduct subsequent reasoning. Improving this capability requires high-quality vision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire. Self-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to alleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation. However, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique visual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs. To address this, we introduce Self-Training on Image Comprehension (STIC), which emphasizes a self-training approach specifically for image comprehension. First, the model self-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled images. Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while dis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or misleading prompts. To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual information, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing instruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the prompts. We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average while using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method. Further studies investigate various components of STIC and highlight its potential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training. Code and data are made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayneel Parekh, Pegah Khayatan, Mustafa Shukor, Alasdair Newson, Matthieu Cord</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks. Despite recent advancements towards the interpretability of these models, understanding internal representations of LMMs remains largely a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as ``multi-modal concepts''. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually. Our implementation is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail V. Tamm, Els Heinsalu, Stefano Scialla, Marco Patriarca</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a language competition model that is based on the Abrams-Strogatz model and incorporates the effects of memory and learning in the language shift dynamics. On a coarse grained time scale, the effects of memory and learning can be expressed as thresholds on the speakers fractions of the competing languages. In its simplest form, the resulting model is exactly solvable. Besides the consensus on one of the two languages, the model describes additional equilibrium states that are not present in the Abrams-Strogatz model: a stable dynamical coexistence of the two languages and a frozen state coinciding with the initial state. We show numerically that these results are preserved for threshold functions of a more general shape. The comparison of the model predictions with historical datasets demonstrates that while the Abrams-Strogatz model fails to describe some relevant language competition situations, the proposed model provides a good fitting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihan Ren, Junpeng Zhang, Yang Xu, Yue Xin, Dongrui Liu, Quanshi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proves the two-phase dynamics of a deep neural network (DNN) learning interactions. Despite the long disappointing view of the faithfulness of post-hoc explanation of a DNN, a series of theorems have been proven in recent years to show that for a given input sample, a small set of interactions between input variables can be considered as primitive inference patterns that faithfully represent a DNN's detailed inference logic on that sample. Particularly, Zhang et al. have observed that various DNNs all learn interactions of different complexities in two distinct phases, and this two-phase dynamics well explains how a DNN changes from under-fitting to over-fitting. Therefore, in this study, we mathematically prove the two-phase dynamics of interactions, providing a theoretical mechanism for how the generalization power of a DNN changes during the training process. Experiments show that our theory well predicts the real dynamics of interactions on different DNNs trained for various tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitzan Bitton-Guetta, Aviv Slobodkin, Aviya Maimon, Eliya Habba, Royi Rassin, Yonatan Bitton, Idan Szpektor, Amir Globerson, Yuval Elovici</p>
<p>Abstract: Imagine observing someone scratching their arm; to understand why, additional context would be necessary. However, spotting a mosquito nearby would immediately offer a likely explanation for the person's discomfort, thereby alleviating the need for further information. This example illustrates how subtle visual cues can challenge our cognitive skills and demonstrates the complexity of interpreting visual scenarios. To study these skills, we present Visual Riddles, a benchmark aimed to test vision and language models on visual riddles requiring commonsense and world knowledge. The benchmark comprises 400 visual riddles, each featuring a unique image created by a variety of text-to-image models, question, ground-truth answer, textual hint, and attribution. Human evaluation reveals that existing models lag significantly behind human performance, which is at 82% accuracy, with Gemini-Pro-1.5 leading with 40% accuracy. Our benchmark comes with automatic evaluation tasks to make assessment scalable. These findings underscore the potential of Visual Riddles as a valuable resource for enhancing vision and language models' capabilities in interpreting complex visual scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunze Man, Shuhong Zheng, Zhipeng Bao, Martial Hebert, Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06927">Representation Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher M. Ackerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation engineering is becoming increasingly popular as a means of online control of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we extend the idea of inference-time steering with vectors that represent a behavioral direction of interest to tuning those vectors directly into the model, obviating the need for online control. First, we identify activation vectors related to honesty in an open-source LLM (Llama-2-13b-chat). Next, we demonstrate that model output can be made more or less honest by adding positive or negative multiples of these vectors to residual stream activations during generation. Then, we show that a similar effect can be achieved by fine-tuning the vectors directly into the model, by use of a dual loss function based on the cosine similarity of residual stream activations to the vectors combined with a standard token-based loss ("representation tuning"). Finally, we compare the generations in response to honesty-probing prompts from the resulting models to those from models fine-tuned with a token-based loss alone, and to those from the untuned model subjected to online steering. Overall, fine-tuning the vectors into the models using the cosine similarity plus token loss showed a stronger effect than online steering, and generalized better than using the standard loss, suggesting the potential utility of this approach as a safety measure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takehiro Takayanagi, Hiroya Takamura, Kiyoshi Izumi, Chung-Chi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content. This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness. The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models. Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers. We release our dataset to assist future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the semantic web, ontology version control is required to capture time-varying information, most importantly for widely-used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose yet another approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation, measurement, and testbed for OV tasks. Reusing the prior alignment(s) from OM, we propose a pipeline optimisation method called cross-reference (CR) mechanism to improve overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in modified Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also discuss the insights on OM used for OV tasks, where some false mappings detected by OV systems are not actually false.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daking Rai, Rydia R. Weiland, Kayla Margaret Gabriella Herrera, Tyler H. Shaw, Ziyu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining the decisions of AI has become vital for fostering appropriate user trust in these systems. This paper investigates explanations for a structured prediction task called ``text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing'', which translates a natural language question into a structured query language (SQL) program. In this task setting, we designed three levels of model explanation, each exposing a different amount of the model's decision-making details (called ``algorithm transparency''), and investigated how different model explanations could potentially yield different impacts on the user experience. Our study with $\sim$100 participants shows that (1) the low-/high-transparency explanations often lead to less/more user reliance on the model decisions, whereas the medium-transparency explanations strike a good balance. We also show that (2) only the medium-transparency participant group was able to engage further in the interaction and exhibit increasing performance over time, and that (3) they showed the least changes in trust before and after the study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangang Hao, Wenju Cui, Patrick Kyllonen, Emily Kerzabi, Lei Liu, Michael Flor</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is widely recognized as a critical 21st century skill. Efficiently coding communication data is a big challenge in scaling up research on assessing CPS. This paper reports the findings on using ChatGPT to directly code CPS chat data by benchmarking performance across multiple datasets and coding frameworks. We found that ChatGPT-based coding outperformed human coding in tasks where the discussions were characterized by colloquial languages but fell short in tasks where the discussions dealt with specialized scientific terminology and contexts. The findings offer practical guidelines for researchers to develop strategies for efficient and scalable analysis of communication data from CPS tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Liu, Kaiming Liu, Yiqi Zhu, Xuanyu Lei, Zonghan Yang, Zhenhe Zhang, Peng Li, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid development of artificial intelligence has drastically accelerated the development of scientific discovery. Trained with large-scale observation data, deep neural networks extract the underlying patterns in an end-to-end manner and assist human researchers with highly-precised predictions in unseen scenarios. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the empowered autonomous agents enable scientists to gain help through interaction in different stages of their research, including but not limited to literature review, research ideation, idea implementation, and academic writing. However, AI researchers instantiated by foundation model empowered agents with full-process autonomy are still in their infancy. In this paper, we study $\textbf{AI-Generated Science}$ (AIGS), where agents independently and autonomously complete the entire research process and discover scientific laws. By revisiting the definition of scientific research, we argue that $\textit{falsification}$ is the essence of both human research process and the design of an AIGS system. Through the lens of falsification, prior systems attempting towards AI-Generated Science either lack the part in their design, or rely heavily on existing verification engines that narrow the use in specialized domains. In this work, we propose Baby-AIGS as a baby-step demonstration of a full-process AIGS system, which is a multi-agent system with agents in roles representing key research process. By introducing FalsificationAgent, which identify and then verify possible scientific discoveries, we empower the system with explicit falsification. Experiments on three tasks preliminarily show that Baby-AIGS could produce meaningful scientific discoveries, though not on par with experienced human researchers. Finally, we discuss on the limitations of current Baby-AIGS, actionable insights, and related ethical issues in detail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mircea Lic\u{a}, Ojas Shirekar, Baptiste Colle, Chirag Raman</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary embodied agents, such as Voyager in Minecraft, have demonstrated promising capabilities in open-ended individual learning. However, when powered with open large language models (LLMs), these agents often struggle with rudimentary tasks, even when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by human cultural learning, we present \collabvoyager, a novel framework that enhances Voyager with lifelong collaborative learning through explicit perspective-taking. \collabvoyager introduces three key innovations: (1) theory of mind representations linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural language communication between agents; and (3) semantic memory of task and environment knowledge and episodic memory of collaboration episodes. These advancements enable agents to reason about their and others' mental states, empirically addressing two prevalent failure modes: false beliefs and faulty task executions. In mixed-expertise Minecraft experiments, \collabvoyager agents outperform Voyager counterparts, significantly improving task completion rate by $66.6\% (+39.4\%)$ for collecting one block of dirt and $70.8\% (+20.8\%)$ for collecting one wood block. They exhibit emergent behaviors like knowledge transfer from expert to novice agents and collaborative code correction. \collabvoyager agents also demonstrate the ability to adapt to out-of-distribution tasks by using their previous experiences and beliefs obtained through collaboration. In this open-ended social learning paradigm, \collabvoyager paves the way for the democratic development of embodied AI, where agents learn in deployment from both peer and environmental feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents. While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for one-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework that employs an iterative narrowing mechanism to improve the performance of both general and fine-tuned models in GUI grounding by up to 61%. For evaluation, we tested our method on a comprehensive benchmark comprising various UI platforms and provided the code to reproduce our results.</p>

<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the implementation and acceptance of remotely proctored high-stake assessments. While the flexible administration of the tests brings forth many values, it raises test security-related concerns. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed tremendous advances in the last five years. Many AI tools (such as the very recent ChatGPT) can generate high-quality responses to test items. These new developments require test security research beyond the statistical analysis of scores and response time. Data analytics and AI methods based on clickstream process data can get us deeper insight into the test-taking process and hold great promise for securing remotely administered high-stakes tests. This chapter uses real-world examples to show that this is indeed the case.</p>
