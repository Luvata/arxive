<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahatara Ferdousi, M. Anwar Hossain, Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</p>
<p>Abstract: Texture image generation has been studied for various applications, including gaming and entertainment. However, context-specific realistic texture generation for industrial applications, such as generating defect textures on railway components, remains unexplored. A mobile-friendly, LLM-based tool that generates fine-grained defect characteristics offers a solution to the challenge of understanding the impact of defects from actual occurrences. We introduce TextureMeDefect, an innovative tool leveraging an LLM-based AI-Inferencing engine. The tool allows users to create realistic defect textures interactively on images of railway components taken with smartphones or tablets. We conducted a multifaceted evaluation to assess the relevance of the generated texture, time, and cost in using this tool on iOS and Android platforms. We also analyzed the software usability score (SUS) across three scenarios. TextureMeDefect outperformed traditional image generation tools by generating meaningful textures faster, showcasing the potential of AI-driven mobile applications on consumer-grade devices.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18099">Gesture2Text: A Generalizable Decoder for Word-Gesture Keyboards in XR Through Trajectory Coarse Discretization and Pre-training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiao Shen, Khadija Khaldi, Enmin Zhou, Hemant Bhaskar Surale, Amy Karlson</p>
<p>Abstract: Text entry with word-gesture keyboards (WGK) is emerging as a popular method and becoming a key interaction for Extended Reality (XR). However, the diversity of interaction modes, keyboard sizes, and visual feedback in these environments introduces divergent word-gesture trajectory data patterns, thus leading to complexity in decoding trajectories into text. Template-matching decoding methods, such as SHARK^2, are commonly used for these WGK systems because they are easy to implement and configure. However, these methods are susceptible to decoding inaccuracies for noisy trajectories. While conventional neural-network-based decoders (neural decoders) trained on word-gesture trajectory data have been proposed to improve accuracy, they have their own limitations: they require extensive data for training and deep-learning expertise for implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution that combines ease of implementation with high decoding accuracy: a generalizable neural decoder enabled by pre-training on large-scale coarsely discretized word-gesture trajectories. This approach produces a ready-to-use WGK decoder that is generalizable across mid-air and on-surface WGK systems in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which is evident by a robust average Top-4 accuracy of 90.4% on four diverse datasets. It significantly outperforms SHARK^2 with a 37.2% enhancement and surpasses the conventional neural decoder by 7.4%. Moreover, the Pre-trained Neural Decoder's size is only 4 MB after quantization, without sacrificing accuracy, and it can operate in real-time, executing in just 97 milliseconds on Quest 3.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18100">RingGesture: A Ring-Based Mid-Air Gesture Typing System Powered by a Deep-Learning Word Prediction Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiao Shen, Roger Boldu, Arpit Kalla, Michael Glueck, Hemant Bhaskar Surale Amy Karlson</p>
<p>Abstract: Text entry is a critical capability for any modern computing experience, with lightweight augmented reality (AR) glasses being no exception. Designed for all-day wearability, a limitation of lightweight AR glass is the restriction to the inclusion of multiple cameras for extensive field of view in hand tracking. This constraint underscores the need for an additional input device. We propose a system to address this gap: a ring-based mid-air gesture typing technique, RingGesture, utilizing electrodes to mark the start and end of gesture trajectories and inertial measurement units (IMU) sensors for hand tracking. This method offers an intuitive experience similar to raycast-based mid-air gesture typing found in VR headsets, allowing for a seamless translation of hand movements into cursor navigation. To enhance both accuracy and input speed, we propose a novel deep-learning word prediction framework, Score Fusion, comprised of three key components: a) a word-gesture decoding model, b) a spatial spelling correction model, and c) a lightweight contextual language model. In contrast, this framework fuses the scores from the three models to predict the most likely words with higher precision. We conduct comparative and longitudinal studies to demonstrate two key findings: firstly, the overall effectiveness of RingGesture, which achieves an average text entry speed of 27.3 words per minute (WPM) and a peak performance of 47.9 WPM. Secondly, we highlight the superior performance of the Score Fusion framework, which offers a 28.2% improvement in uncorrected Character Error Rate over a conventional word prediction framework, Naive Correction, leading to a 55.2% improvement in text entry speed for RingGesture. Additionally, RingGesture received a System Usability Score of 83 signifying its excellent usability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18108">A Deep Learning Approach to Estimate Canopy Height and Uncertainty by Integrating Seasonal Optical, SAR and Limited GEDI LiDAR Data over Northern Forests</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose B. Castro, Cheryl Rogers, Camile Sothe, Dominic Cyr, Alemu Gonsamo</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate forest canopy height estimation is essential for evaluating aboveground biomass and carbon stock dynamics, supporting ecosystem monitoring services like timber provisioning, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation. However, despite advancements in spaceborne LiDAR technology, data for northern high latitudes remain limited due to orbital and sampling constraints. This study introduces a methodology for generating spatially continuous, high-resolution canopy height and uncertainty estimates using Deep Learning Regression models. We integrate multi-source, multi-seasonal satellite data from Sentinel-1, Landsat, and ALOS-PALSAR-2, with spaceborne GEDI LiDAR as reference data. Our approach was tested in Ontario, Canada, and validated with airborne LiDAR, demonstrating strong performance. The best results were achieved by incorporating seasonal Sentinel-1 and Landsat features alongside PALSAR data, yielding an R-square of 0.72, RMSE of 3.43 m, and bias of 2.44 m. Using seasonal data instead of summer-only data improved variability by 10%, reduced error by 0.45 m, and decreased bias by 1 m. The deep learning model's weighting strategy notably reduced errors in tall canopy height estimates compared to a recent global model, though it overestimated lower canopy heights. Uncertainty maps highlighted greater uncertainty near forest edges, where GEDI measurements are prone to errors and SAR data may encounter backscatter issues like foreshortening, layover, and shadow. This study enhances canopy height estimation techniques in areas lacking spaceborne LiDAR coverage, providing essential tools for forestry, environmental monitoring, and carbon stock estimation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18109">NaVIP: An Image-Centric Indoor Navigation Solution for Visually Impaired People</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yu, Yifan Zhang, Badrinadh Aila, Vinod Namboodiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor navigation is challenging due to the absence of satellite positioning. This challenge is manifold greater for Visually Impaired People (VIPs) who lack the ability to get information from wayfinding signage. Other sensor signals (e.g., Bluetooth and LiDAR) can be used to create turn-by-turn navigation solutions with position updates for users. Unfortunately, these solutions require tags to be installed all around the environment or the use of fairly expensive hardware. Moreover, these solutions require a high degree of manual involvement that raises costs, thus hampering scalability. We propose an image dataset and associated image-centric solution called NaVIP towards visual intelligence that is infrastructure-free and task-scalable, and can assist VIPs in understanding their surroundings. Specifically, we start by curating large-scale phone camera data in a four-floor research building, with 300K images, to lay the foundation for creating an image-centric indoor navigation and exploration solution for inclusiveness. Every image is labelled with precise 6DoF camera poses, details of indoor PoIs, and descriptive captions to assist VIPs. We benchmark on two main aspects: 1) positioning system and 2) exploration support, prioritizing training scalability and real-time inference, to validate the prospect of image-based solution towards indoor navigation. The dataset, code, and model checkpoints are made publicly available at https://github.com/junfish/VIP_Navi.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18115">Point Cloud Compression with Bits-back Coding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Quang Hieu, Minh Nguyen, Dinh Thai Hoang, Diep N. Nguyen, Eryk Dutkiewicz</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel lossless compression method for compressing geometric attributes of point cloud data with bits-back coding. Our method specializes in using a deep learning-based probabilistic model to estimate the Shannon's entropy of the point cloud information, i.e., geometric attributes of the 3D floating points. Once the entropy of the point cloud dataset is estimated with a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE), we use the learned CVAE model to compress the geometric attributes of the point clouds with the bits-back coding technique. The novelty of our method with bits-back coding specializes in utilizing the learned latent variable model of the CVAE to compress the point cloud data. By using bits-back coding, we can capture the potential correlation between the data points, such as similar spatial features like shapes and scattering regions, into the lower-dimensional latent space to further reduce the compression ratio. The main insight of our method is that we can achieve a competitive compression ratio as conventional deep learning-based approaches, while significantly reducing the overhead cost of storage and/or communicating the compression codec, making our approach more applicable in practical scenarios. Throughout comprehensive evaluations, we found that the cost for the overhead is significantly small, compared to the reduction of the compression ratio when compressing large point cloud datasets. Experiment results show that our proposed approach can achieve a compression ratio of 1.56 bit-per-point on average, which is significantly lower than the baseline approach such as Google's Draco with a compression ratio of 1.83 bit-per-point.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrey Vishen, Jatin Sarabu, Chinmay Bharathulwar, Rithwick Lakshmanan, Vishnu Srinivas</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method for diffusion-guided frameworks for view-consistent super-resolution (SR) in neural rendering. Our approach leverages existing 2D SR models in conjunction with advanced techniques such as Variational Score Distilling (VSD) and a LoRA fine-tuning helper, with spatial training to significantly boost the quality and consistency of upscaled 2D images compared to the previous methods in the literature, such as Renoised Score Distillation (RSD) proposed in DiSR-NeRF (1), or SDS proposed in DreamFusion. The VSD score facilitates precise fine-tuning of SR models, resulting in high-quality, view-consistent images. To address the common challenge of inconsistencies among independent SR 2D images, we integrate Iterative 3D Synchronization (I3DS) from the DiSR-NeRF framework. Our quantitative benchmarks and qualitative results on the LLFF dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our system compared to existing methods such as DiSR-NeRF.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18195">Personalized Instance-based Navigation Toward User-Specific Objects in Realistic Environments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Barsellotti, Roberto Bigazzi, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last years, the research interest in visual navigation towards objects in indoor environments has grown significantly. This growth can be attributed to the recent availability of large navigation datasets in photo-realistic simulated environments, like Gibson and Matterport3D. However, the navigation tasks supported by these datasets are often restricted to the objects present in the environment at acquisition time. Also, they fail to account for the realistic scenario in which the target object is a user-specific instance that can be easily confused with similar objects and may be found in multiple locations within the environment. To address these limitations, we propose a new task denominated Personalized Instance-based Navigation (PIN), in which an embodied agent is tasked with locating and reaching a specific personal object by distinguishing it among multiple instances of the same category. The task is accompanied by PInNED, a dedicated new dataset composed of photo-realistic scenes augmented with additional 3D objects. In each episode, the target object is presented to the agent using two modalities: a set of visual reference images on a neutral background and manually annotated textual descriptions. Through comprehensive evaluations and analyses, we showcase the challenges of the PIN task as well as the performance and shortcomings of currently available methods designed for object-driven navigation, considering modular and end-to-end agents.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18200">Rethinking Positive Pairs in Contrastive Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiantao Wu, Shentong Mo, Zhenhua Feng, Sara Atito, Josef Kitler, Muhammad Awais</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning, a prominent approach to representation learning, traditionally assumes positive pairs are closely related samples (the same image or class) and negative pairs are distinct samples. We challenge this assumption by proposing to learn from arbitrary pairs, allowing any pair of samples to be positive within our framework.The primary challenge of the proposed approach lies in applying contrastive learning to disparate pairs which are semantically distant. Motivated by the discovery that SimCLR can separate given arbitrary pairs (e.g., garter snake and table lamp) in a subspace, we propose a feature filter in the condition of class pairs that creates the requisite subspaces by gate vectors selectively activating or deactivating dimensions. This filter can be optimized through gradient descent within a conventional contrastive learning mechanism.
  We present Hydra, a universal contrastive learning framework for visual representations that extends conventional contrastive learning to accommodate arbitrary pairs. Our approach is validated using IN1K, where 1K diverse classes compose 500,500 pairs, most of them being distinct. Surprisingly, Hydra achieves superior performance in this challenging setting. Additional benefits include the prevention of dimensional collapse and the discovery of class relationships. Our work highlights the value of learning common features of arbitrary pairs and potentially broadens the applicability of contrastive learning techniques on the sample pairs with weak relationships.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18208">Automated Defect Detection and Grading of Piarom Dates Using Deep Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasrin Azimi, Danial Mohammad Rezaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Grading and quality control of Piarom dates, a premium and high-value variety cultivated predominantly in Iran, present significant challenges due to the complexity and variability of defects, as well as the absence of specialized automated systems tailored to this fruit. Traditional manual inspection methods are labor intensive, time consuming, and prone to human error, while existing AI-based sorting solutions are insufficient for addressing the nuanced characteristics of Piarom dates. In this study, we propose an innovative deep learning framework designed specifically for the real-time detection, classification, and grading of Piarom dates. Leveraging a custom dataset comprising over 9,900 high-resolution images annotated across 11 distinct defect categories, our framework integrates state-of-the-art object detection algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high precision in defect identification. Furthermore, we employ advanced segmentation techniques to estimate the area and weight of each date, thereby optimizing the grading process according to industry standards. Experimental results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for industrial applications requiring real-time processing. This work not only provides a robust and scalable solution for automating quality control in the Piarom date industry but also contributes to the broader field of AI-driven food inspection technologies, with potential applications across various agricultural products.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaofen Nan, Gaodeng Fan, Kaifan Zhang, Chen Zhao, Fubao Zhu, Weihua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of medical image analysis, image registration is a crucial technique. Despite the numerous registration models that have been proposed, existing methods still fall short in terms of accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we present MsMorph, a deep learning-based image registration framework aimed at mimicking the manual process of registering image pairs to achieve more similar deformations, where the registered image pairs exhibit consistency or similarity in features. By extracting the feature differences between image pairs across various as-pects using gradients, the framework decodes semantic information at different scales and continuously compen-sates for the predicted deformation field, driving the optimization of parameters to significantly improve registration accuracy. The proposed method simulates the manual approach to registration, focusing on different regions of the image pairs and their neighborhoods to predict the deformation field between the two images, which provides strong interpretability. We compared several existing registration methods on two public brain MRI datasets, including LPBA and Mindboggle. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state of the art in terms of metrics such as Dice score, Hausdorff distance, average symmetric surface distance, and non-Jacobian.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefanos Pasios, Nikos Nikolaidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulators are indispensable for research in autonomous systems such as self-driving cars, autonomous robots and drones. Despite significant progress in various simulation aspects, such as graphical realism, an evident gap persists between the virtual and real-world environments. Since the ultimate goal is to deploy the autonomous systems in the real world, closing the sim2real gap is of utmost importance. In this paper, we employ a state-ofthe-art approach to enhance the photorealism of simulated data, aligning them with the visual characteristics of real-world datasets. Based on this, we developed CARLA2Real, an easy-to-use, publicly available tool (plug-in) for the widely used and open-source CARLA simulator. This tool enhances the output of CARLA in near realtime, achieving a frame rate of 13 FPS, translating it to the visual style and realism of real-world datasets such as Cityscapes, KITTI, and Mapillary Vistas. By employing the proposed tool, we generated synthetic datasets from both the simulator and the enhancement model outputs, including their corresponding ground truth annotations for tasks related to autonomous driving. Then, we performed a number of experiments to evaluate the impact of the proposed approach on feature extraction and semantic segmentation methods when trained on the enhanced synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the sim2real gap is significant and can indeed be reduced by the introduced approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing effective scene text detection and recognition models hinges on extensive training data, which can be both laborious and costly to obtain, especially for low-resourced languages. Conventional methods tailored for Latin characters often falter with non-Latin scripts due to challenges like character stacking, diacritics, and variable character widths without clear word boundaries. In this paper, we introduce the first Khmer scene-text dataset, featuring 1,544 expert-annotated images, including 997 indoor and 547 outdoor scenes. This diverse dataset includes flat text, raised text, poorly illuminated text, distant and partially obscured text. Annotations provide line-level text and polygonal bounding box coordinates for each scene. The benchmark includes baseline models for scene-text detection and recognition tasks, providing a robust starting point for future research endeavors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Sung-Bin, Oh Hyun-Bin, JungMok Lee, Arda Senocak, Joon Son Chung, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Following the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), expanding their boundaries to new modalities represents a significant paradigm shift in multimodal understanding. Human perception is inherently multimodal, relying not only on text but also on auditory and visual cues for a complete understanding of the world. In recognition of this fact, audio-visual LLMs have recently emerged. Despite promising developments, the lack of dedicated benchmarks poses challenges for understanding and evaluating models. In this work, we show that audio-visual LLMs struggle to discern subtle relationships between audio and visual signals, leading to hallucinations, underscoring the need for reliable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce AVHBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the perception and comprehension capabilities of audio-visual LLMs. Our benchmark includes tests for assessing hallucinations, as well as the cross-modal matching and reasoning abilities of these models. Our results reveal that most existing audio-visual LLMs struggle with hallucinations caused by cross-interactions between modalities, due to their limited capacity to perceive complex multimodal signals and their relationships. Additionally, we demonstrate that simple training with our AVHBench improves robustness of audio-visual LLMs against hallucinations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthesizing realistic videos of talking faces under custom lighting conditions and viewing angles benefits various downstream applications like video conferencing. However, most existing relighting methods are either time-consuming or unable to adjust the viewpoints. In this paper, we present the first real-time 3D-aware method for relighting in-the-wild videos of talking faces based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Given an input portrait video, our method can synthesize talking faces under both novel views and novel lighting conditions with a photo-realistic and disentangled 3D representation. Specifically, we infer an albedo tri-plane, as well as a shading tri-plane based on a desired lighting condition for each video frame with fast dual-encoders. We also leverage a temporal consistency network to ensure smooth transitions and reduce flickering artifacts. Our method runs at 32.98 fps on consumer-level hardware and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of reconstruction quality, lighting error, lighting instability, temporal consistency and inference speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interactivity of our method on various portrait videos with diverse lighting and viewing conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Several medical Multimodal Large Languange Models (MLLMs) have been developed to address tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities, achieving impressive results. Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence.To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Han, Yuheng Jia, Hui Liu, Junhui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral variation is a common problem for hyperspectral image (HSI) representation. Low-rank tensor representation is an important approach to alleviate spectral variations. However, the spatial distribution of the HSI is always irregular, while the previous tensor low-rank representation methods can only be applied to the regular data cubes, which limits the performance. To remedy this issue, in this paper we propose a novel irregular tensor low-rank representation model. We first segment the HSI data into several irregular homogeneous regions. Then, we propose a novel irregular tensor low-rank representation method that can efficiently model the irregular 3D cubes. We further use a non-convex nuclear norm to pursue the low-rankness and introduce a negative global low-rank term that improves global consistency. This proposed model is finally formulated as a convex-concave optimization problem and solved by alternative augmented Lagrangian method. Through experiments on four public datasets, the proposed method outperforms the existing low-rank based HSI methods significantly. Code is available at: https://github.com/hb-studying/ITLRR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingbo Hong, Shen Cheng, Haibin Huang, Haoqiang Fan, Shuaicheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce YOLA, a novel framework for object detection in low-light scenarios. Unlike previous works, we propose to tackle this challenging problem from the perspective of feature learning. Specifically, we propose to learn illumination-invariant features through the Lambertian image formation model. We observe that, under the Lambertian assumption, it is feasible to approximate illumination-invariant feature maps by exploiting the interrelationships between neighboring color channels and spatially adjacent pixels. By incorporating additional constraints, these relationships can be characterized in the form of convolutional kernels, which can be trained in a detection-driven manner within a network. Towards this end, we introduce a novel module dedicated to the extraction of illumination-invariant features from low-light images, which can be easily integrated into existing object detection frameworks. Our empirical findings reveal significant improvements in low-light object detection tasks, as well as promising results in both well-lit and over-lit scenarios.

<p>Abstract: We introduce a cutting-edge video compression framework tailored for the age of ubiquitous video data, uniquely designed to serve machine learning applications. Unlike traditional compression methods that prioritize human visual perception, our innovative approach focuses on preserving semantic information critical for deep learning accuracy, while efficiently reducing data size.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18408">Scale Propagation Network for Generalizable Depth Completion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Wang, Meng Yang, Xinhu Zheng, Gang Hua</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth completion, inferring dense depth maps from sparse measurements, is crucial for robust 3D perception. Although deep learning based methods have made tremendous progress in this problem, these models cannot generalize well across different scenes that are unobserved in training, posing a fundamental limitation that yet to be overcome. A careful analysis of existing deep neural network architectures for depth completion, which are largely borrowing from successful backbones for image analysis tasks, reveals that a key design bottleneck actually resides in the conventional normalization layers. These normalization layers are designed, on one hand, to make training more stable, on the other hand, to build more visual invariance across scene scales. However, in depth completion, the scale is actually what we want to robustly estimate in order to better generalize to unseen scenes. To mitigate, we propose a novel scale propagation normalization (SP-Norm) method to propagate scales from input to output, and simultaneously preserve the normalization operator for easy convergence. More specifically, we rescale the input using learned features of a single-layer perceptron from the normalized input, rather than directly normalizing the input as conventional normalization layers. We then develop a new network architecture based on SP-Norm and the ConvNeXt V2 backbone. We explore the composition of various basic blocks and architectures to achieve superior performance and efficient inference for generalizable depth completion. Extensive experiments are conducted on six unseen datasets with various types of sparse depth maps, i.e., randomly sampled 0.1\%/1\%/10\% valid pixels, 4/8/16/32/64-line LiDAR points, and holes from Structured-Light. Our model consistently achieves the best accuracy with faster speed and lower memory when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18410">FreCaS: Efficient Higher-Resolution Image Generation via Frequency-aware Cascaded Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengqiang Zhang, Ruihuang Li, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While image generation with diffusion models has achieved a great success, generating images of higher resolution than the training size remains a challenging task due to the high computational cost. Current methods typically perform the entire sampling process at full resolution and process all frequency components simultaneously, contradicting with the inherent coarse-to-fine nature of latent diffusion models and wasting computations on processing premature high-frequency details at early diffusion stages. To address this issue, we introduce an efficient $\textbf{Fre}$quency-aware $\textbf{Ca}$scaded $\textbf{S}$ampling framework, $\textbf{FreCaS}$ in short, for higher-resolution image generation. FreCaS decomposes the sampling process into cascaded stages with gradually increased resolutions, progressively expanding frequency bands and refining the corresponding details. We propose an innovative frequency-aware classifier-free guidance (FA-CFG) strategy to assign different guidance strengths for different frequency components, directing the diffusion model to add new details in the expanded frequency domain of each stage. Additionally, we fuse the cross-attention maps of previous and current stages to avoid synthesizing unfaithful layouts. Experiments demonstrate that FreCaS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and generation speed. In particular, FreCaS is about 2.86$\times$ and 6.07$\times$ faster than ScaleCrafter and DemoFusion in generating a 2048$\times$2048 image using a pre-trained SDXL model and achieves an FID$_b$ improvement of 11.6 and 3.7, respectively. FreCaS can be easily extended to more complex models such as SD3. The source code of FreCaS can be found at $\href{\text{https://github.com/xtudbxk/FreCaS}}{https://github.com/xtudbxk/FreCaS}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxin Peng, Yongjian Liao, Weijun Li, Chuanyu Fu, Guoxin Zhang, Ziquan Ding, Zijie Huang, Qiku Cao, Shuting Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-View Stereo plays a pivotal role in civil engineering by facilitating 3D modeling, precise engineering surveying, quantitative analysis, as well as monitoring and maintenance. It serves as a valuable tool, offering high-precision and real-time spatial information crucial for various engineering projects. However, Multi-View Stereo algorithms encounter challenges in reconstructing weakly-textured regions within large-scale building scenes. In these areas, the stereo matching of pixels often fails, leading to inaccurate depth estimations. Based on the Segment Anything Model and RANSAC algorithm, we propose an algorithm that accurately segments weakly-textured regions and constructs their plane priors. These plane priors, combined with triangulation priors, form a reliable prior candidate set. Additionally, we introduce a novel global information aggregation cost function. This function selects optimal plane prior information based on global information in the prior candidate set, constrained by geometric consistency during the depth estimation update process. Experimental results on both the ETH3D benchmark dataset, aerial dataset, building dataset and real scenarios substantiate the superior performance of our method in producing 3D building models compared to other state-of-the-art methods. In summary, our work aims to enhance the completeness and density of 3D building reconstruction, carrying implications for broader applications in urban planning and virtual reality.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning framework for the multi-class classification of gastrointestinal abnormalities in Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) frames. The aim is to automate the identification of ten GI abnormality classes, including angioectasia, bleeding, and ulcers, thereby reducing the diagnostic burden on gastroenterologists. Utilizing an ensemble of DenseNet and ResNet architectures, the proposed model achieves an overall accuracy of 94\% across a well-structured dataset. Precision scores range from 0.56 for erythema to 1.00 for worms, with recall rates peaking at 98% for normal findings. This study emphasizes the importance of robust data preprocessing techniques, including normalization and augmentation, in enhancing model performance. The contributions of this work lie in developing an effective AI-driven tool that streamlines the diagnostic process in gastroenterology, ultimately improving patient care and clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanxiang Yang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Guangshun Wei, Long Ma, Junhui Hou, Yuan Liu, Wenping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As commonly used implicit geometry representations, the signed distance function (SDF) is limited to modeling watertight shapes, while the unsigned distance function (UDF) is capable of representing various surfaces. However, its inherent theoretical shortcoming, i.e., the non-differentiability at the zero level set, would result in sub-optimal reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose the scaled-squared distance function (S$^{2}$DF), a novel implicit surface representation for modeling arbitrary surface types. S$^{2}$DF does not distinguish between inside and outside regions while effectively addressing the non-differentiability issue of UDF at the zero level set. We demonstrate that S$^{2}$DF satisfies a second-order partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere-type, allowing us to develop a learning pipeline that leverages a novel Monge-Ampere regularization to directly learn S$^{2}$DF from raw unoriented point clouds without supervision from ground-truth S$^{2}$DF values. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches that require ground-truth surface information as supervision for training.

<p>Abstract: Defect segmentation is crucial for quality control in advanced manufacturing, yet data scarcity poses challenges for state-of-the-art supervised deep learning. Synthetic defect data generation is a popular approach for mitigating data challenges. However, many current methods simply generate defects following a fixed set of rules, which may not directly relate to downstream task performance. This can lead to suboptimal performance and may even hinder the downstream task. To solve this problem, we leverage a novel bi-level optimization-based synthetic defect data generation framework. We use an online synthetic defect generation module grounded in the commonly-used Cut\&Paste framework, and adopt an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm to solve the bi-level optimization problem. We achieve simultaneous training of the defect segmentation network, and learn various parameters of the data synthesis module by maximizing the validation performance of the trained defect segmentation network. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets under limited data settings show that the proposed bi-level optimization method can be used for learning the most effective locations for pasting synthetic defects thereby improving the segmentation performance by up to 18.3\% when compared to pasting defects at random locations. We also demonstrate up to 2.6\% performance gain by learning the importance weights for different augmentation-specific defect data sources when compared to giving equal importance to all the data sources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Geometric calibration of cameras and projectors is an essential step that must be performed before any imaging system can be used. There are many well-known geometric calibration methods for calibrating systems comprised of multiple cameras, but simultaneous geometric calibration of multiple projectors and cameras has received less attention. This leaves unresolved several practical issues which must be considered to achieve the simplicity of use required for real world applications. In this work we discuss several important components of a real-world geometric calibration procedure used in our laboratory to calibrate surface imaging systems comprised of many projectors and cameras. We specifically discuss the design of the calibration object and the image processing pipeline used to analyze it in the acquired images. We also provide quantitative calibration results in the form of reprojection errors and compare them to the classic approaches such as Zhang's calibration method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The availability of highly accurate urban airborne laser scanning (ALS) data will increase rapidly in the future, especially as acquisition costs decrease, for example through the use of drones. Current challenges in data processing are related to the limited spectral information and low point density of most ALS datasets. Another challenge will be the growing need for annotated training data, frequently produced by manual processes, to enable semantic interpretation of point clouds. This study proposes to semantically segment new high-density (1200 points per square metre on average) multispectral ALS data with an unsupervised ground-aware deep clustering method GroupSP inspired by the unsupervised GrowSP algorithm. GroupSP divides the scene into superpoints as a preprocessing step. The neural network is trained iteratively by grouping the superpoints and using the grouping assignments as pseudo-labels. The predictions for the unseen data are given by over-segmenting the test set and mapping the predicted classes into ground truth classes manually or with automated majority voting. GroupSP obtained an overall accuracy (oAcc) of 97% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 80%. When compared to other unsupervised semantic segmentation methods, GroupSP outperformed GrowSP and non-deep K-means. However, a supervised random forest classifier outperformed GroupSP. The labelling efforts in GroupSP can be minimal; it was shown, that the GroupSP can semantically segment seven urban classes (building, high vegetation, low vegetation, asphalt, rock, football field, and gravel) with oAcc of 95% and mIoU of 75% using only 0.004% of the available annotated points in the mapping assignment. Finally, the multispectral information was examined; adding each new spectral channel improved the mIoU. Additionally, echo deviation was valuable, especially when distinguishing ground-level classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghao Hu, Yuhe Zhang, GuoHua Geng, Liuyuxin Yang, JiaRui Yan, Jingtao Cheng, YaDong Zhang, Kang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, style has been primarily considered in terms of artistic elements such as colors, brushstrokes, and lighting. However, identical semantic subjects, like people, boats, and houses, can vary significantly across different artistic traditions, indicating that style also encompasses the underlying semantics. Therefore, in this study, we propose a zero-shot scheme for image variation with coordinated semantics. Specifically, our scheme transforms the image-to-image problem into an image-to-text-to-image problem. The image-to-text operation employs vision-language models e.g., BLIP) to generate text describing the content of the input image, including the objects and their positions. Subsequently, the input style keyword is elaborated into a detailed description of this style and then merged with the content text using the reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT. Finally, the text-to-image operation utilizes a Diffusion model to generate images based on the text prompt. To enable the Diffusion model to accommodate more styles, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that injects text and style constraints into cross-attention. This ensures that the output image exhibits similar semantics in the desired style. To validate the performance of the proposed scheme, we constructed a benchmark comprising images of various styles and scenes and introduced two novel metrics. Despite its simplicity, our scheme yields highly plausible results in a zero-shot manner, particularly for generating stylized images with high-fidelity semantics.</p>

The difficulty increases when the segmentation is with arbitrary granularity, meaning the number of segments can vary arbitrarily, and masks are defined based on only one or a few sample images. In this paper, we address this issue by employing a pre-trained text to image diffusion model supplemented with an additional tracking mechanism. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively manage various segmentation scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marian Longa, Jo\~ao F. Henriques</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning interpretable representations of visual data is an important challenge, to make machines' decisions understandable to humans and to improve generalisation outside of the training distribution. To this end, we propose a deep learning framework where one can specify nonlinear priors for videos (e.g. of Newtonian physics) that allow the model to learn interpretable latent variables and use these to generate videos of hypothetical scenarios not observed at training time. We do this by extending the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) prior from a simple isotropic Gaussian to an arbitrary nonlinear temporal Additive Noise Model (ANM), which can describe a large number of processes (e.g. Newtonian physics). We propose a novel linearization method that constructs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approximating the prior, and derive a numerically stable Monte Carlo estimate of the KL divergence between the posterior and prior GMMs. We validate the method on different real-world physics videos including a pendulum, a mass on a spring, a falling object and a pulsar (rotating neutron star). We specify a physical prior for each experiment and show that the correct variables are learned. Once a model is trained, we intervene on it to change different physical variables (such as oscillation amplitude or adding air drag) to generate physically correct videos of hypothetical scenarios that were not observed previously.</p>

Additionally, we propose a stroke-level Graph Modeling method for both local (LGM) and global (GGM) information, which applies an end-to-end model to Online HMER tasks, transforming the recognition problem into node and edge classification tasks in graph structure. By capturing both local and global graph features, our method ensures comprehensive understanding of the expression structure. Through the combination of these components, our system demonstrates superior performance in symbol detection, relation classification, and expression-level recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjin Zhang, Jiahao Wang, Jianming Wang, Qi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Gesture recognition based on surface electromyographic signal (sEMG) is one of the most used methods. The traditional manual feature extraction can only extract some low-level signal features, this causes poor classifier performance and low recognition accuracy when dealing with some complex signals. A recognition method, namely SEDCNN-SVM, is proposed to recognize sEMG of different gestures. SEDCNN-SVM consists of an improved deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a support vector machine (SVM). The DCNN can automatically extract and learn the feature information of sEMG through the convolution operation of the convolutional layer, so that it can capture the complex and high-level features in the data. The Squeeze and Excitation Networks (SE-Net) and the residual module were added to the model, so that the feature representation of each channel could be improved, the loss of feature information in convolutional operations was reduced, useful feature information was captured, and the problem of network gradient vanishing was eased. The SVM can improve the generalization ability and classification accuracy of the model by constructing an optimal hyperplane of the feature space. Hence, the SVM was used to replace the full connection layer and the Softmax function layer of the DCNN, the use of a suitable kernel function in SVM can improve the model's generalization ability and classification accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classification algorithm, this method is analyzed and compared with other comparative classification methods. The recognition accuracy of SEDCNN-SVM can reach 0.955, it is significantly improved compared with other classification methods, the SEDCNN-SVM model is recognized online in real time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom\'a\v{s} Pivo\v{n}ka, Libor P\v{r}eu\v{c}il</p>
<p>Abstract: Re-ranking is the second stage of a visual place recognition task, in which the system chooses the best-matching images from a pre-selected subset of candidates. Model-free approaches compute the image pair similarity based on a spatial comparison of corresponding local visual features, eliminating the need for computationally expensive estimation of a model describing transformation between images. The article focuses on model-free re-ranking based on standard local visual features and their applicability in long-term autonomy systems. It introduces three new model-free re-ranking methods that were designed primarily for deep-learned local visual features. These features evince high robustness to various appearance changes, which stands as a crucial property for use with long-term autonomy systems. All the introduced methods were employed in a new visual place recognition system together with the D2-net feature detector (Dusmanu, 2019) and experimentally tested with diverse, challenging public datasets. The obtained results are on par with current state-of-the-art methods, affirming that model-free approaches are a viable and worthwhile path for long-term visual place recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher T. H Teo, Milad Abdollahzadeh, Xinda Ma, Ngai-man Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has emerged as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fair text-to-image (T2I) generation. Specifically, this approach leverages readily available reference images to learn inclusive prompts for each target Sensitive Attribute (tSA), allowing for fair image generation. In this work, we first reveal that this prompt learning-based approach results in degraded sample quality. Our analysis shows that the approach's training objective -- which aims to align the embedding differences of learned prompts and reference images -- could be sub-optimal, resulting in distortion of the learned prompts and degraded generated images. To further substantiate this claim, as our major contribution, we deep dive into the denoising subnetwork of the T2I model to track down the effect of these learned prompts by analyzing the cross-attention maps. In our analysis, we propose a novel prompt switching analysis: I2H and H2I. Furthermore, we propose new quantitative characterization of cross-attention maps. Our analysis reveals abnormalities in the early denoising steps, perpetuating improper global structure that results in degradation in the generated samples. Building on insights from our analysis, we propose two ideas: (i) Prompt Queuing and (ii) Attention Amplification to address the quality issue. Extensive experimental results on a wide range of tSAs show that our proposed method outperforms SOTA approach's image generation quality, while achieving competitive fairness.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18622">Environment Maps Editing using Inverse Rendering and Adversarial Implicit Functions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio D'Orazio, Davide Sforza, Fabio Pellacini, Iacopo Masi</p>
<p>Abstract: Editing High Dynamic Range (HDR) environment maps using an inverse differentiable rendering architecture is a complex inverse problem due to the sparsity of relevant pixels and the challenges in balancing light sources and background. The pixels illuminating the objects are a small fraction of the total image, leading to noise and convergence issues when the optimization directly involves pixel values. HDR images, with pixel values beyond the typical Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), pose additional challenges. Higher learning rates corrupt the background during optimization, while lower learning rates fail to manipulate light sources. Our work introduces a novel method for editing HDR environment maps using a differentiable rendering, addressing sparsity and variance between values. Instead of introducing strong priors that extract the relevant HDR pixels and separate the light sources, or using tricks such as optimizing the HDR image in the log space, we propose to model the optimized environment map with a new variant of implicit neural representations able to handle HDR images. The neural representation is trained with adversarial perturbations over the weights to ensure smooth changes in the output when it receives gradients from the inverse rendering. In this way, we obtain novel and cheap environment maps without relying on latent spaces of expensive generative models, maintaining the original visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in reconstructing the desired lighting effects while preserving the fidelity of the map and reflections on objects in the scene. Our approach can pave the way to interesting tasks, such as estimating a new environment map given a rendering with novel light sources, maintaining the initial perceptual features, and enabling brush stroke-based editing of existing environment maps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Lin, Sa\'ul Alexis Heredia P\'erez, Kanako Harada</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological specimens exhibit significant variations in size and shape, challenging autonomous robotic manipulation. We focus on the mouse skull window creation task to illustrate these challenges. The study introduces a microscopic stereo camera system (MSCS) enhanced by the linear model for depth perception. Alongside this, a precise registration scheme is developed for the partially exposed mouse cranial surface, employing a CNN-based constrained and colorized registration strategy. These methods are integrated with the MSCS for robotic micromanipulation tasks. The MSCS demonstrated a high precision of 0.10 mm $\pm$ 0.02 mm measured in a step height experiment and real-time performance of 30 FPS in 3D reconstruction. The registration scheme proved its precision, with a translational error of 1.13 mm $\pm$ 0.31 mm and a rotational error of 3.38$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 0.89$^{\circ}$ tested on 105 continuous frames with an average speed of 1.60 FPS. This study presents the application of a MSCS and a novel registration scheme in enhancing the precision and accuracy of robotic micromanipulation in scientific and surgical settings. The innovations presented here offer automation methodology in handling the challenges of microscopic manipulation, paving the way for more accurate, efficient, and less invasive procedures in various fields of microsurgery and scientific research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuang Ai, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Huaibo Huang, Xiaotian Han, Zhengyu Chen, Quanzeng You, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration (IR) in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges due to the lack of high-capacity models and comprehensive datasets. To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Schopf-Kuester, Zorah L\"ahner, Michael Moeller</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the problem of \textit{shape completion}, i.e., the task of restoring incomplete shapes by predicting their missing parts. While previous works have often predicted the fractured and restored shape in one step, we approach the task by separately predicting the fractured and newly restored parts, but ensuring these predictions are interconnected. We use a decoder network motivated by related work on the prediction of signed distance functions (DeepSDF). In particular, our representation allows us to consider test-time-training, i.e., finetuning network parameters to match the given incomplete shape more accurately during inference. While previous works often have difficulties with artifacts around the fracture boundary, we demonstrate that our overfitting to the fractured parts leads to significant improvements in the restoration of eight different shape categories of the ShapeNet data set in terms of their chamfer distances.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18677">Enhancing pretraining efficiency for medical image segmentation via transferability metrics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> G\'abor Hidy, Bence Bakos, Andr\'as Luk\'acs</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, the scarcity of labeled training data poses a significant challenge when training deep neural networks. When using U-Net-style architectures, it is common practice to address this problem by pretraining the encoder part on a large general-purpose dataset like ImageNet. However, these methods are resource-intensive and do not guarantee improved performance on the downstream task. In this paper we investigate a variety of training setups on medical image segmentation datasets, using ImageNet-pretrained models. By examining over 300 combinations of models, datasets, and training methods, we find that shorter pretraining often leads to better results on the downstream task, providing additional proof to the well-known fact that the accuracy of the model on ImageNet is a poor indicator for downstream performance. As our main contribution, we introduce a novel transferability metric, based on contrastive learning, that measures how robustly a pretrained model is able to represent the target data. In contrast to other transferability scores, our method is applicable to the case of transferring from ImageNet classification to medical image segmentation. We apply our robustness score by measuring it throughout the pretraining phase to indicate when the model weights are optimal for downstream transfer. This reduces pretraining time and improves results on the target task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Hamza, Aizea Lojo, Adrian N\'u\~nez-Marcos, Aitziber Atutxa</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Ali-AUG, a novel single-step diffusion model for efficient labeled data augmentation in industrial applications. Our method addresses the challenge of limited labeled data by generating synthetic, labeled images with precise feature insertion. Ali-AUG utilizes a stable diffusion architecture enhanced with skip connections and LoRA modules to efficiently integrate masks and images, ensuring accurate feature placement without affecting unrelated image content. Experimental validation across various industrial datasets demonstrates Ali-AUG's superiority in generating high-quality, defect-enhanced images while maintaining rapid single-step inference. By offering precise control over feature insertion and minimizing required training steps, our technique significantly enhances data augmentation capabilities, providing a powerful tool for improving the performance of deep learning models in scenarios with limited labeled data. Ali-AUG is especially useful for use cases like defective product image generation to train AI-based models to improve their ability to detect defects in manufacturing processes. Using different data preparation strategies, including Classification Accuracy Score (CAS) and Naive Augmentation Score (NAS), we show that Ali-AUG improves model performance by 31% compared to other augmentation methods and by 45% compared to models without data augmentation. Notably, Ali-AUG reduces training time by 32% and supports both paired and unpaired datasets, enhancing flexibility in data preparation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Brandst\"atter, Philipp Seeb\"ock, Christoph F\"urb\"ock, Svitlana Pochepnia, Helmut Prosch, Georg Langs</p>
<p>Abstract: 2D to 3D registration is essential in tasks such as diagnosis, surgical navigation, environmental understanding, navigation in robotics, autonomous systems, or augmented reality. In medical imaging, the aim is often to place a 2D image in a 3D volumetric observation to w. Current approaches for rigid single slice in volume registration are limited by requirements such as pose initialization, stacks of adjacent slices, or reliable anatomical landmarks. Here, we propose a self-supervised 2D/3D registration approach to match a single 2D slice to the corresponding 3D volume. The method works in data without anatomical priors such as images of tumors. It addresses the dimensionality disparity and establishes correspondences between 2D in-plane and 3D out-of-plane rotation-equivariant features by using group equivariant CNNs. These rotation-equivariant features are extracted from the 2D query slice and aligned with their 3D counterparts. Results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed slice-in-volume registration on the NSCLC-Radiomics CT and KIRBY21 MRI datasets, attaining an absolute median angle error of less than 2 degrees and a mean-matching feature accuracy of 89% at a tolerance of 3 pixels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Jaus, Constantin Seibold, Simon Rei{\ss}, Zdravko Marinov, Keyi Li, Zeling Ye, Stefan Krieg, Jens Kleesiek, Rainer Stiefelhagen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Connected-Component~(CC)-Metrics, a novel semantic segmentation evaluation protocol, targeted to align existing semantic segmentation metrics to a multi-instance detection scenario in which each connected component matters. We motivate this setup in the common medical scenario of semantic metastases segmentation in a full-body PET/CT. We show how existing semantic segmentation metrics suffer from a bias towards larger connected components contradicting the clinical assessment of scans in which tumor size and clinical relevance are uncorrelated. To rebalance existing segmentation metrics, we propose to evaluate them on a per-component basis thus giving each tumor the same weight irrespective of its size. To match predictions to ground-truth segments, we employ a proximity-based matching criterion, evaluating common metrics locally at the component of interest. Using this approach, we break free of biases introduced by large metastasis for overlap-based metrics such as Dice or Surface Dice. CC-Metrics also improves distance-based metrics such as Hausdorff Distances which are uninformative for small changes that do not influence the maximum or 95th percentile, and avoids pitfalls introduced by directly combining counting-based metrics with overlap-based metrics as it is done in Panoptic Quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renshuai Tao, Manyi Le, Chuangchuang Tan, Huan Liu, Haotong Qin, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advances in deepfake detection, handling varying image quality, especially due to different compressions on online social networks (OSNs), remains challenging. Current methods succeed by leveraging correlations between paired images, whether raw or compressed. However, in open-world scenarios, paired data is scarce, with compressed images readily available but corresponding raw versions difficult to obtain. This imbalance, where unpaired data vastly outnumbers paired data, often leads to reduced detection performance, as existing methods struggle without corresponding raw images. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel approach named the open-world deepfake detection network (ODDN), which comprises two core modules: open-world data aggregation (ODA) and compression-discard gradient correction (CGC). ODA effectively aggregates correlations between compressed and raw samples through both fine-grained and coarse-grained analyses for paired and unpaired data, respectively. CGC incorporates a compression-discard gradient correction to further enhance performance across diverse compression methods in OSN. This technique optimizes the training gradient to ensure the model remains insensitive to compression variations. Extensive experiments conducted on 17 popular deepfake datasets demonstrate the superiority of the ODDN over SOTA baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18695">PESFormer: Boosting Macro- and Micro-expression Spotting with Direct Timestamp Encoding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang-Wang Yu, Kai-Fu Yang, Xiangrui Hu, Jingwen Jiang, Hong-Mei Yan, Yong-Jie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of macro- and micro-expression spotting aims to precisely localize and categorize temporal expression instances within untrimmed videos. Given the sparse distribution and varying durations of expressions, existing anchor-based methods often represent instances by encoding their deviations from predefined anchors. Additionally, these methods typically slice the untrimmed videos into fixed-length sliding windows. However, anchor-based encoding often fails to capture all training intervals, and slicing the original video as sliding windows can result in valuable training intervals being discarded. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PESFormer, a simple yet effective model based on the vision transformer architecture to achieve point-to-interval expression spotting. PESFormer employs a direct timestamp encoding (DTE) approach to replace anchors, enabling binary classification of each timestamp instead of optimizing entire ground truths. Thus, all training intervals are retained in the form of discrete timestamps. To maximize the utilization of training intervals, we enhance the preprocessing process by replacing the short videos produced through the sliding window method.Instead, we implement a strategy that involves zero-padding the untrimmed training videos to create uniform, longer videos of a predetermined duration. This operation efficiently preserves the original training intervals and eliminates video slice enhancement.Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on three datasets -- CAS(ME)^2, CAS(ME)^3 and SAMM-LV -- demonstrate that our PESFormer outperforms existing techniques, achieving the best performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the task of general conversational image retrieval on open-domain images. The objective is to search for images based on interactive conversations between humans and computers. To advance this task, we curate a dataset called ChatSearch. This dataset includes a multi-round multimodal conversational context query for each target image, thereby requiring the retrieval system to find the accurate image from database. Simultaneously, we propose a generative retrieval model named ChatSearcher, which is trained end-to-end to accept/produce interleaved image-text inputs/outputs. ChatSearcher exhibits strong capability in reasoning with multimodal context and can leverage world knowledge to yield visual retrieval results. It demonstrates superior performance on the ChatSearch dataset and also achieves competitive results on other image retrieval tasks and visual conversation tasks. We anticipate that this work will inspire further research on interactive multimodal retrieval systems. Our dataset will be available at https://github.com/joez17/ChatSearch.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence promise ample potential in monitoring applications with surveillance cameras. However, concerns about privacy and model bias have made it challenging to utilize them in public. Although de-identification approaches have been proposed in the literature, aiming to achieve a certain level of anonymization, most of them employ deep learning models that are computationally demanding for real-time edge deployment. In this study, we revisit conventional anonymization solutions for privacy protection and real-time video anomaly detection (VAD) applications. We propose a novel lightweight adaptive anonymization for VAD (LA3D) that employs dynamic adjustment to enhance privacy protection. We evaluated the approaches on publicly available privacy and VAD data sets to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the different anonymization techniques and highlight the promising efficacy of our approach. Our experiment demonstrates that LA3D enables substantial improvement in the privacy anonymization capability without majorly degrading VAD efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengfei Xia, Nan Xue, Yujun Shen, Ran Yi, Tieliang Gong, Yong-Jin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which combines the conditional and unconditional score functions with two coefficients summing to one, serves as a practical technique for diffusion model sampling. Theoretically, however, denoising with CFG cannot be expressed as a reciprocal diffusion process, which may consequently leave some hidden risks during use. In this work, we revisit the theory behind CFG and rigorously confirm that the improper configuration of the combination coefficients (i.e., the widely used summing-to-one version) brings about expectation shift of the generative distribution. To rectify this issue, we propose ReCFG with a relaxation on the guidance coefficients such that denoising with ReCFG strictly aligns with the diffusion theory. We further show that our approach enjoys a closed-form solution given the guidance strength. That way, the rectified coefficients can be readily pre-computed via traversing the observed data, leaving the sampling speed barely affected. Empirical evidence on real-world data demonstrate the compatibility of our post-hoc design with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models, including both class-conditioned ones (e.g., EDM2 on ImageNet) and text-conditioned ones (e.g., SD3 on CC12M), without any retraining. We will open-source the code to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Lin, Mengmeng Wang, Jiahao Wang, Wenbin An, Yan Chen, Yong Liu, Feng Tian, Guang Dai, Jingdong Wang, Qianying Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling high-quality and diverse modifications driven by text prompts. However, effective editing requires inverting the source image into a latent space, a process often hindered by prediction errors inherent in DDIM inversion. These errors accumulate during the diffusion process, resulting in inferior content preservation and edit fidelity, especially with conditional inputs. We address these challenges by investigating the primary contributors to error accumulation in DDIM inversion and identify the singularity problem in traditional noise schedules as a key issue. To resolve this, we introduce the Logistic Schedule, a novel noise schedule designed to eliminate singularities, improve inversion stability, and provide a better noise space for image editing. This schedule reduces noise prediction errors, enabling more faithful editing that preserves the original content of the source image. Our approach requires no additional retraining and is compatible with various existing editing methods. Experiments across eight editing tasks demonstrate the Logistic Schedule's superior performance in content preservation and edit fidelity compared to traditional noise schedules, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilin Lu, Zihan Zhou, Jiayou Lu, Yuanzhi Zhu, Adams Wai-Kin Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18794">WARP-LCA: Efficient Convolutional Sparse Coding with Locally Competitive Algorithm</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Geoffrey Kasenbacher, Felix Ehret, Gerrit Ecke, Sebastian Otte</p>
<p>Abstract: The locally competitive algorithm (LCA) can solve sparse coding problems across a wide range of use cases. Recently, convolution-based LCA approaches have been shown to be highly effective for enhancing robustness for image recognition tasks in vision pipelines. To additionally maximize representational sparsity, LCA with hard-thresholding can be applied. While this combination often yields very good solutions satisfying an $\ell_0$ sparsity criterion, it comes with significant drawbacks for practical application: (i) LCA is very inefficient, typically requiring hundreds of optimization cycles for convergence; (ii) the use of hard-thresholding results in a non-convex loss function, which might lead to suboptimal minima. To address these issues, we propose the Locally Competitive Algorithm with State Warm-up via Predictive Priming (WARP-LCA), which leverages a predictor network to provide a suitable initial guess of the LCA state based on the current input. Our approach significantly improves both convergence speed and the quality of solutions, while maintaining and even enhancing the overall strengths of LCA. We demonstrate that WARP-LCA converges faster by orders of magnitude and reaches better minima compared to conventional LCA. Moreover, the learned representations are more sparse and exhibit superior properties in terms of reconstruction and denoising quality as well as robustness when applied in deep recognition pipelines. Furthermore, we apply WARP-LCA to image denoising tasks, showcasing its robustness and practical effectiveness. Our findings confirm that the naive use of LCA with hard-thresholding results in suboptimal minima, whereas initializing LCA with a predictive guess results in better outcomes. This research advances the field of biologically inspired deep learning by providing a novel approach to convolutional sparse coding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nian Wu, Miaomiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method, named geodesic deformable networks (GDN), that for the first time enables the learning of geodesic flows of deformation fields derived from images. In particular, the capability of our proposed GDN being able to predict geodesics is important for quantifying and comparing deformable shape presented in images. The geodesic deformations, also known as optimal transformations that align pairwise images, are often parameterized by a time sequence of smooth vector fields governed by nonlinear differential equations. A bountiful literature has been focusing on learning the initial conditions (e.g., initial velocity fields) based on registration networks. However, the definition of geodesics central to deformation-based shape analysis is blind to the networks. To address this problem, we carefully develop an efficient neural operator to treat the geodesics as unknown mapping functions learned from the latent deformation spaces. A composition of integral operators and smooth activation functions is then formulated to effectively approximate such mappings. In contrast to previous works, our GDN jointly optimizes a newly defined geodesic loss, which adds additional benefits to promote the network regularizability and generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDN on both 2D synthetic data and 3D real brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandros Graikos, Nebojsa Jojic, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have dominated the field of large, generative image models, with the prime examples of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3 being widely adopted. These models have been trained to perform text-conditioned generation on vast numbers of image-caption pairs and as a byproduct, have acquired general knowledge about natural image statistics. However, when confronted with the task of constrained sampling, e.g. generating the right half of an image conditioned on the known left half, applying these models is a delicate and slow process, with previously proposed algorithms relying on expensive iterative operations that are usually orders of magnitude slower than text-based inference. This is counter-intuitive, as image-conditioned generation should rely less on the difficult-to-learn semantic knowledge that links captions and imagery, and should instead be achievable by lower-level correlations among image pixels. In practice, inverse models are trained or tuned separately for each inverse problem, e.g. by providing parts of images during training as an additional condition, to allow their application in realistic settings. However, we argue that this is not necessary and propose an algorithm for fast-constrained sampling in large pre-trained diffusion models (Stable Diffusion) that requires no expensive backpropagation operations through the model and produces results comparable even to the state-of-the-art \emph{tuned} models. Our method is based on a novel optimization perspective to sampling under constraints and employs a numerical approximation to the expensive gradients, previously computed using backpropagation, incurring significant speed-ups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tonglin Chen, Yinxuan Huang, Zhimeng Shen, Jinghao Huang, Bin Li, Xiangyang Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can discern scene-independent features of objects across various environments, allowing them to swiftly identify objects amidst changing factors such as lighting, perspective, size, and position and imagine the complete images of the same object in diverse settings. Existing object-centric learning methods only extract scene-dependent object-centric representations, lacking the ability to identify the same object across scenes as humans. Moreover, some existing methods discard the individual object generation capabilities to handle complex scenes. This paper introduces a novel object-centric learning method to empower AI systems with human-like capabilities to identify objects across scenes and generate diverse scenes containing specific objects by learning a set of global object-centric representations. To learn the global object-centric representations that encapsulate globally invariant attributes of objects (i.e., the complete appearance and shape), this paper designs a Disentangled Slot Attention module to convert the scene features into scene-dependent attributes (such as scale, position and orientation) and scene-independent representations (i.e., appearance and shape). Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating remarkable proficiency in global object-centric representation learning, object identification, scene generation with specific objects and scene decomposition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Han, Junsheng Zhou, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis from sparse inputs is a vital yet challenging task in 3D computer vision. Previous methods explore 3D Gaussian Splatting with neural priors (e.g. depth priors) as an additional supervision, demonstrating promising quality and efficiency compared to the NeRF based methods. However, the neural priors from 2D pretrained models are often noisy and blurry, which struggle to precisely guide the learning of radiance fields. In this paper, We propose a novel method for synthesizing novel views from sparse views with Gaussian Splatting that does not require external prior as supervision. Our key idea lies in exploring the self-supervisions inherent in the binocular stereo consistency between each pair of binocular images constructed with disparity-guided image warping. To this end, we additionally introduce a Gaussian opacity constraint which regularizes the Gaussian locations and avoids Gaussian redundancy for improving the robustness and efficiency of inferring 3D Gaussians from sparse views. Extensive experiments on the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yejin Choi, Jiwan Chung, Sumin Shim, Giyeong Oh, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual text design plays a critical role in conveying themes, emotions, and atmospheres in multimodal formats such as film posters and album covers. Translating these visual and textual elements across languages extends the concept of translation beyond mere text, requiring the adaptation of aesthetic and stylistic features. To address this, we introduce a novel task of Multimodal Style Translation (MuST-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of visual text generation models to perform translation across different writing systems while preserving design intent. Our initial experiments on MuST-Bench reveal that existing visual text generation models struggle with the proposed task due to the inadequacy of textual descriptions in conveying visual design. In response, we introduce SIGIL, a framework for multimodal style translation that eliminates the need for style descriptions. SIGIL enhances image generation models through three innovations: glyph latent for multilingual settings, pretrained VAEs for stable style guidance, and an OCR model with reinforcement learning feedback for optimizing readable character generation. SIGIL outperforms existing baselines by achieving superior style consistency and legibility while maintaining visual fidelity, setting itself apart from traditional description-based approaches. We release MuST-Bench publicly for broader use and exploration https://huggingface.co/datasets/yejinc/MuST-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Zhang, Teng Zhou, Xinlong Zhang, Jia Wei, Yongchuan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained recognition for generating diverse and high-quality content, especially in the domain of image synthesis. These models excel not only in creating fixed-size images but also in producing panoramic images. However, existing methods often struggle with spatial layout consistency when producing high-resolution panoramas, due to the lack of guidance of the global image layout. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Scale Diffusion (MSD) framework, a plug-and-play module that extends the existing panoramic image generation framework to multiple resolution levels. By utilizing gradient descent techniques, our method effectively incorporates structural information from low-resolution images into high-resolution outputs. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method was conducted, comparing it with the prior works in qualitative and quantitative dimensions. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms others in generating coherent high-resolution panoramas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyuk Chun, Wonjae Kim, Song Park, Sangdoo Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijian Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: One-step text-to-image generator models offer advantages such as swift inference efficiency, flexible architectures, and state-of-the-art generation performance. In this paper, we study the problem of aligning one-step generator models with human preferences for the first time. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), we formulate the alignment problem as maximizing expected human reward functions while adding an Integral Kullback-Leibler divergence term to prevent the generator from diverging. By overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\alpha$ as the reference diffusion processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score (HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\alpha$. Both theoretical contributions and empirical evidence indicate that DI++ is a strong human-preference alignment approach for one-step text-to-image models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SegLLM, a novel multi-round interactive reasoning segmentation model that enhances LLM-based segmentation by exploiting conversational memory of both visual and textual outputs. By leveraging a mask-aware multimodal LLM, SegLLM re-integrates previous segmentation results into its input stream, enabling it to reason about complex user intentions and segment objects in relation to previously identified entities, including positional, interactional, and hierarchical relationships, across multiple interactions. This capability allows SegLLM to respond to visual and text queries in a chat-like manner. Evaluated on the newly curated MRSeg benchmark, SegLLM outperforms existing methods in multi-round interactive reasoning segmentation by over 20%. Additionally, we observed that training on multi-round reasoning segmentation data enhances performance on standard single-round referring segmentation and localization tasks, resulting in a 5.5% increase in cIoU for referring expression segmentation and a 4.5% improvement in Acc@0.5 for referring expression localization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a significant advancement in 3D scene reconstruction, attracting considerable attention due to its ability to recover high-fidelity details while maintaining low complexity. Despite the promising results achieved by 3DGS, its rendering performance is constrained by its dependence on costly non-commutative alpha-blending operations. These operations mandate complex view dependent sorting operations that introduce computational overhead, especially on the resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones. In this paper, we propose Weighted Sum Rendering, which approximates alpha blending with weighted sums, thereby removing the need for sorting. This simplifies implementation, delivers superior performance, and eliminates the "popping" artifacts caused by sorting. Experimental results show that optimizing a generalized Gaussian splatting formulation to the new differentiable rendering yields competitive image quality. The method was implemented and tested in a mobile device GPU, achieving on average $1.23\times$ faster rendering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing and understanding 3D structures from a limited number of images is a well-established problem in computer vision. Traditional methods usually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complex transformations between different data representations. For instance, dense reconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further dense modeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. This multi-step process results in considerable processing time and increased engineering complexity.
  In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processes unposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward operation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting with language at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSM integrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatial attribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder then parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, facilitating supervised end-to-end learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial intelligence is the ability of a machine to perceive, reason, and act in three dimensions within space and time. Recent advancements in large-scale auto-regressive models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various reasoning tasks. However, these models often struggle with fundamental aspects of spatial reasoning, particularly in answering questions like "Where am I?" and "What will I see?". While some attempts have been done, existing approaches typically treat them as separate tasks, failing to capture their interconnected nature. In this paper, we present Generative Spatial Transformer (GST), a novel auto-regressive framework that jointly addresses spatial localization and view prediction. Our model simultaneously estimates the camera pose from a single image and predicts the view from a new camera pose, effectively bridging the gap between spatial awareness and visual prediction. The proposed innovative camera tokenization method enables the model to learn the joint distribution of 2D projections and their corresponding spatial perspectives in an auto-regressive manner. This unified training paradigm demonstrates that joint optimization of pose estimation and novel view synthesis leads to improved performance in both tasks, for the first time, highlighting the inherent relationship between spatial awareness and visual prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3D object generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant interest in developing large multimodal models (LMMs) capable of performing various visual reasoning and understanding tasks. This has led to the introduction of multiple LMM benchmarks to evaluate LMMs on different tasks. However, most existing LMM evaluation benchmarks are predominantly English-centric. In this work, we develop a comprehensive LMM evaluation benchmark for the Arabic language to represent a large population of over 400 million speakers. The proposed benchmark, named CAMEL-Bench, comprises eight diverse domains and 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding to evaluate broad scenario generalizability. Our CAMEL-Bench comprises around 29,036 questions that are filtered from a larger pool of samples, where the quality is manually verified by native speakers to ensure reliable model assessment. We conduct evaluations of both closed-source, including GPT-4 series, and open-source LMMs. Our analysis reveals the need for substantial improvement, especially among the best open-source models, with even the closed-source GPT-4o achieving an overall score of 62%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling-Hao Chen, Wenxun Dai, Xuan Ju, Shunlin Lu, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This research delves into the problem of interactive editing of human motion generation. Previous motion diffusion models lack explicit modeling of the word-level text-motion correspondence and good explainability, hence restricting their fine-grained editing ability. To address this issue, we propose an attention-based motion diffusion model, namely MotionCLR, with CLeaR modeling of attention mechanisms. Technically, MotionCLR models the in-modality and cross-modality interactions with self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. More specifically, the self-attention mechanism aims to measure the sequential similarity between frames and impacts the order of motion features. By contrast, the cross-attention mechanism works to find the fine-grained word-sequence correspondence and activate the corresponding timesteps in the motion sequence. Based on these key properties, we develop a versatile set of simple yet effective motion editing methods via manipulating attention maps, such as motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place motion replacement, and example-based motion generation, etc. For further verification of the explainability of the attention mechanism, we additionally explore the potential of action-counting and grounded motion generation ability via attention maps. Our experimental results show that our method enjoys good generation and editing ability with good explainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Wang, Qiuyu Wang, Kecheng Zheng, Hao Ouyang, Zhekai Chen, Biao Gong, Hao Chen, Yujun Shen, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Framer for interactive frame interpolation, which targets producing smoothly transitioning frames between two images as per user creativity. Concretely, besides taking the start and end frames as inputs, our approach supports customizing the transition process by tailoring the trajectory of some selected keypoints. Such a design enjoys two clear benefits. First, incorporating human interaction mitigates the issue arising from numerous possibilities of transforming one image to another, and in turn enables finer control of local motions. Second, as the most basic form of interaction, keypoints help establish the correspondence across frames, enhancing the model to handle challenging cases (e.g., objects on the start and end frames are of different shapes and styles). It is noteworthy that our system also offers an "autopilot" mode, where we introduce a module to estimate the keypoints and refine the trajectory automatically, to simplify the usage in practice. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance of Framer on various applications, such as image morphing, time-lapse video generation, cartoon interpolation, etc. The code, the model, and the interface will be released to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Fei, Wenzhao Zheng, Yueqi Duan, Wei Zhan, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose PixelGaussian, an efficient feed-forward framework for learning generalizable 3D Gaussian reconstruction from arbitrary views. Most existing methods rely on uniform pixel-wise Gaussian representations, which learn a fixed number of 3D Gaussians for each view and cannot generalize well to more input views. Differently, our PixelGaussian dynamically adapts both the Gaussian distribution and quantity based on geometric complexity, leading to more efficient representations and significant improvements in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we introduce a Cascade Gaussian Adapter to adjust Gaussian distribution according to local geometry complexity identified by a keypoint scorer. CGA leverages deformable attention in context-aware hypernetworks to guide Gaussian pruning and splitting, ensuring accurate representation in complex regions while reducing redundancy. Furthermore, we design a transformer-based Iterative Gaussian Refiner module that refines Gaussian representations through direct image-Gaussian interactions. Our PixelGaussian can effectively reduce Gaussian redundancy as input views increase. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale ACID and RealEstate10K datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with good generalization to various numbers of views.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Wang, Shenglin Yin, Xiaoying Bai, Minghao Hu, Tianwei Yan, Yi Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Entity Linking (MEL) is a fundamental component for various downstream tasks. However, existing MEL datasets suffer from small scale, scarcity of topic types and limited coverage of tasks, making them incapable of effectively enhancing the entity linking capabilities of multi-modal models. To address these obstacles, we propose a dataset construction pipeline and publish $M^3EL$, a large-scale dataset for MEL. $M^3EL$ includes 79,625 instances, covering 9 diverse multi-modal tasks, and 5 different topics. In addition, to further improve the model's adaptability to multi-modal tasks, We propose a modality-augmented training strategy. Utilizing $M^3EL$ as a corpus, train the $\textit{CLIP}_{\textit{ND}}$ model based on $\textit{CLIP} (\textit{ViT}-\textit{B}-\textit{32})$, and conduct a comparative analysis with an existing multi-modal baselines. Experimental results show that the existing models perform far below expectations (ACC of 49.4%-75.8%), After analysis, it was obtained that small dataset sizes, insufficient modality task coverage, and limited topic diversity resulted in poor generalisation of multi-modal models. Our dataset effectively addresses these issues, and the $\textit{CLIP}_{\textit{ND}}$ model fine-tuned with $M^3EL$ shows a significant improvement in accuracy, with an average improvement of 9.3% to 25% across various tasks. Our dataset is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M3EL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation is crucial in medical imaging,but the manual annotation process by physicians is time-consuming and labor-intensive, necessitating the develop-ment of automatic report generation methods. Existingresearch predominantly utilizes Transformers to generateradiology reports, which can be computationally intensive,limiting their use in real applications. In this work, we presentR2Gen-Mamba, a novel automatic radiology report genera-tion method that leverages the efficient sequence processingof the Mamba with the contextual benefits of Transformerarchitectures. Due to lower computational complexity ofMamba, R2Gen-Mamba not only enhances training and in-ference efficiency but also produces high-quality reports.Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with morethan 210,000 X-ray image-report pairs demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of R2Gen-Mamba regarding report quality andcomputational efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashwat Gupta, L. Gokulnath, Akshan Aggarwal, Mahim Naz, Rajnikanth Yadav, Priyanka Bagade</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiating between Intestinal Tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's Disease (CD) poses a significant clinical challenge due to their similar symptoms, clinical presentations, and imaging features. This study leverages Computed Tomography Enterography (CTE) scans, deep learning, and traditional computer vision to address this diagnostic dilemma. A consensus among radiologists from renowned institutions has recognized the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat (VF/SF) ratio as a surrogate biomarker for differentiating between ITB and CD. Previously done manually, we propose a novel 2D image computer vision algorithm for auto-segmenting subcutaneous fat to automate this ratio calculation, enhancing diagnostic efficiency and objectivity. As a benchmark, we compare the results to those obtained using the TotalSegmentator tool, a popular deep learning-based software for automatic segmentation of anatomical structures, and manual calculations by radiologists. We also demonstrated the performance on 3D CT volumes using a slicing method and provided a benchmark comparison of the algorithm with the TotalSegmentator tool. Additionally, we propose a scoring approach to integrate scores from radiological features, such as the fat ratio and pulmonary TB probability, into a single score for diagnosis. We trained a ResNet10 model on a dataset of CTE scans with samples from ITB, CD, and normal patients, achieving an accuracy of 75%. To enhance interpretability and gain clinical trust, we integrated the explainable AI technique Grad-CAM with ResNet10 to explain the model's predictions. Due to the small dataset size (100 total cases), the feature-based scoring system is considered more reliable and trusted by radiologists compared to the deep learning model for disease diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Dialameh, Hossein Rajabzadeh, Moslem Sadeghi-Goughari, Jung Suk Sim, Hyock Ju Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently managing papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) while minimizing patient discomfort poses a significant clinical challenge. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) offers a less invasive alternative to surgery and radiation therapy for PTMC treatment, characterized by shorter recovery times and reduced pain. As an image-guided procedure, RFA generates localized heat by delivering high-frequency electrical currents through electrodes to the targeted area under ultrasound imaging guidance. However, the precision and skill required by operators for accurate guidance using current ultrasound B-mode imaging technologies remain significant challenges. To address these challenges, we develop a novel AI segmentation model, E2E-Swin-Unet++. This model enhances ultrasound B-mode imaging by enabling real-time identification and segmentation of PTMC tumors and monitoring of the region of interest for precise targeting during treatment. E2E-Swin- Unet++ is an advanced end-to-end extension of the Swin-Unet architecture, incorporating thyroid region information to minimize the risk of false PTMC segmentation while providing fast inference capabilities. Experimental results on a real clinical RFA dataset demonstrate the superior performance of E2E-Swin-Unet++ compared to related models. Our proposed solution significantly improves the precision and control of RFA ablation treatment by enabling real-time identification and segmentation of PTMC margins during the procedure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Liang, Chang Dong, Liangwei Zheng, Zhengyang Li, Wei Zhang, Weitong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of real-world scenarios, where perfect information is rarely available. Humans naturally develop complex internal models to navigate incomplete data and effectively respond to unforeseen or partially observed events. In machine learning, Focal Loss is commonly used to reduce misclassification rates by emphasizing hard-to-classify samples. However, it does not guarantee well-calibrated predicted probabilities and may result in models that are overconfident or underconfident. High calibration error indicates a misalignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, affecting model reliability. This research introduces a novel loss function called Focal Calibration Loss (FCL), designed to improve probability calibration while retaining the advantages of Focal Loss in handling difficult samples. By minimizing the Euclidean norm through a strictly proper loss, FCL penalizes the instance-wise calibration error and constrains bounds. We provide theoretical validation for proposed method and apply it to calibrate CheXNet for potential deployment in web-based health-care systems. Extensive evaluations on various models and datasets demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance in both calibration and accuracy metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong-Guw Lee, Jeongyun Kim, Younggun Cho, Ayoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal Infrared (TIR) imaging provides robust perception for navigating in challenging outdoor environments but faces issues with poor texture and low image contrast due to its 14/16-bit format. Conventional methods utilize various tone-mapping methods to enhance contrast and photometric consistency of TIR images, however, the choice of tone-mapping is largely dependent on knowing the task and temperature dependent priors to work well. In this paper, we present Thermal Chameleon Network (TCNet), a task-adaptive tone-mapping approach for RAW 14-bit TIR images. Given the same image, TCNet tone-maps different representations of TIR images tailored for each specific task, eliminating the heuristic image rescaling preprocessing and reliance on the extensive prior knowledge of the scene temperature or task-specific characteristics. TCNet exhibits improved generalization performance across object detection and monocular depth estimation, with minimal computational overhead and modular integration to existing architectures for various tasks.

<p>Abstract: Web development involves turning UI designs into functional webpages, which can be difficult for both beginners and experienced developers due to the complexity of HTML's hierarchical structures and styles. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs' understanding of HTML's structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing benchmark Design2Code, outperforming current fine-tuning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingyu Yang, Huai Liao, Xinyan Huang, Qingyao Tian, Jinlin Wu, Jingdi Hu, Hongbin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and complete segmentation of airways in chest CT images is essential for the quantitative assessment of lung diseases and the facilitation of pulmonary interventional procedures. Although deep learning has led to significant advancements in medical image segmentation, maintaining airway continuity remains particularly challenging. This difficulty arises primarily from the small and dispersed nature of airway structures, as well as class imbalance in CT scans. To address these challenges, we designed a Multi-scale Nested Residual U-Net (MNR-UNet), incorporating multi-scale inputs and Residual Multi-scale Modules (RMM) into a nested residual framework to enhance information flow, effectively capturing the intricate details of small airways and mitigating gradient vanishing. Building on this, we developed a three-stage segmentation pipeline to optimize the training of the MNR-UNet. The first two stages prioritize high accuracy and sensitivity, while the third stage focuses on repairing airway breakages to balance topological completeness and correctness. To further address class imbalance, we introduced a weighted Breakage-Aware Loss (wBAL) to heighten focus on challenging samples, penalizing breakages and thereby extending the length of the airway tree. Additionally, we proposed a hierarchical evaluation framework to offer more clinically meaningful analysis. Validation on both in-house and public datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves superior performance in detecting more accurate airway voxels and identifying additional branches, significantly improving airway topological completeness. The code will be released publicly following the publication of the paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we examine the effectiveness of an uncertainty quantification framework known as Evidential Deep Learning applied in the context of biomedical image segmentation. This class of models involves assigning Dirichlet distributions as priors for segmentation labels, and enables a few distinct definitions of model uncertainties. Using the cardiac and prostate MRI images available in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon for validation, we found that Evidential Deep Learning models with U-Net backbones generally yielded superior correlations between prediction errors and uncertainties relative to the conventional baseline equipped with Shannon entropy measure, Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensemble methods. We also examined these models' effectiveness in active learning, finding that relative to the standard Shannon entropy-based sampling, they yielded higher point-biserial uncertainty-error correlations while attaining similar performances in Dice-Sorensen coefficients. These superior features of EDL models render them well-suited for segmentation tasks that warrant a critical sensitivity in detecting large model errors.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents the experiments and solution outline for our teams winning submission in the Learn To Race Autonomous Racing Virtual Challenge 2022 hosted by AIcrowd. The objective of the Learn-to-Race competition is to push the boundary of autonomous technology, with a focus on achieving the safety benefits of autonomous driving. In the description the competition is framed as a reinforcement learning (RL) challenge. We focused our initial efforts on implementation of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) variants. Our goal was to learn non-trivial control of the race car exclusively from visual and geometric features, directly mapping pixels to control actions. We made suitable modifications to the default reward policy aiming to promote smooth steering and acceleration control. The framework for the competition provided real time simulation, meaning a single episode (learning experience) is measured in minutes. Instead of pursuing parallelisation of episodes we opted to explore a more traditional approach in which the visual perception was processed (via learned operators) and fed into rule-based controllers. Such a system, while not as academically "attractive" as a pixels-to-actions approach, results in a system that requires less training, is more explainable, generalises better and is easily tuned and ultimately out-performed all other agents in the competition by a large margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a leading health concern and contribute significantly to global mortality rates. While clinical advancements have led to a decline in CVD mortality, accurately identifying individuals who could benefit from preventive interventions remains an unsolved challenge in preventive cardiology. Current CVD risk prediction models, recommended by guidelines, are based on limited traditional risk factors or use CT imaging to acquire quantitative biomarkers, and still have limitations in predictive accuracy and applicability. On the other hand, end-to-end trained CVD risk prediction methods leveraging deep learning on CT images often fail to provide transparent and explainable decision grounds for assisting physicians. In this work, we proposed a novel joint representation that integrates discrete quantitative biomarkers and continuous deep features extracted from chest CT scans. Our approach initiated with a deep CVD risk classification model by capturing comprehensive continuous deep learning features while jointly obtaining currently clinical-established quantitative biomarkers via segmentation models. In the feature joint representation stage, we use an instance-wise feature-gated mechanism to align the continuous and discrete features, followed by a soft instance-wise feature interaction mechanism fostering independent and effective feature interaction for the final CVD risk prediction. Our method substantially improves CVD risk predictive performance and offers individual contribution analysis of each biomarker, which is important in assisting physicians' decision-making processes. We validated our method on a public chest low-dose CT dataset and a private external chest standard-dose CT patient cohort of 17,207 CT volumes from 6,393 unique subjects, and demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving AUCs of 0.875 and 0.843, respectively.</p>

Instead, we theoretically show that its success lies in its ability to implicitly regularize the Frobenius norm of the attention matrix during training. We then explore alternative activations that regularize the Frobenius norm of the attention matrix, demonstrating that certain polynomial activations can achieve this effect, making them suitable for attention-based architectures. Empirical results indicate these activations perform comparably or better than softmax across various computer vision and language tasks, suggesting new possibilities for attention mechanisms beyond softmax.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents require the capability to identify dynamic objects in their environment for safe planning and navigation. Incomplete and erroneous dynamic detections jeopardize the agent's ability to accomplish its task. Dynamic detection is a challenging problem due to the numerous sources of uncertainty inherent in the problem's inputs and the wide variety of applications, which often lead to use-case-tailored solutions. We propose a robust learning-free approach to segment moving objects in point cloud data. The foundation of the approach lies in modelling each voxel using a hidden Markov model (HMM), and probabilistically integrating beliefs into a map using an HMM filter. The proposed approach is tested on benchmark datasets and consistently performs better than or as well as state-of-the-art methods with strong generalized performance across sensor characteristics and environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanguang Zhao, Long Bai, Zhaoxi Zhang, Yanan Wu, Mobarakol Islam, Hongliang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Glioma, a common and deadly brain tumor, requires early diagnosis for improved prognosis. However, low-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) hinders accurate diagnosis. This paper presents our work in the BraTS Challenge on SSA Adult Glioma. We adopt the model from the BraTS-GLI 2021 winning solution and utilize it with three training strategies: (1) initially training on the BraTS-GLI 2021 dataset with fine-tuning on the BraTS-Africa dataset, (2) training solely on the BraTS-Africa dataset, and (3) training solely on the BraTS-Africa dataset with 2x super-resolution enhancement. Results show that initial training on the BraTS-GLI 2021 dataset followed by fine-tuning on the BraTS-Africa dataset has yielded the best results. This suggests the importance of high-quality datasets in providing prior knowledge during training. Our top-performing model achieves Dice scores of 0.882, 0.840, and 0.926, and Hausdorff Distance (95%) scores of 15.324, 37.518, and 13.971 for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively, in the validation phase. In the final phase of the competition, our approach successfully secured second place overall, reflecting the strength and effectiveness of our model and training strategies. Our approach provides insights into improving glioma diagnosis in SSA, showing the potential of deep learning in resource-limited settings and the importance of transfer learning from high-quality datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arturo Martin Jimenez, Marc Baltes, Jackson Cornelius, Neset Akozbek, Zachary Coppens</p>
<p>Abstract: Free-space optical communication (FSOC) systems offer high-bandwidth and secure communication with minimal capital costs. Adaptive optics (AO) are typically added to these systems to decrease atmospheric channel losses; however, the performance of traditional AO wavefront sensors degrades in long-range, deep turbulence conditions. Alternative wavefront sensors using phase diversity can successfully reconstruct wavefronts in deep turbulence, but current implementations require bulky setups with high latency. In this work, we employ a nanostructured birefringent metasurface optic that enables low-latency phase diversity wavefront sensing in a compact form factor. We prove the effectiveness of this approach in mid-to-high turbulence (Rytov numbers from 0.2 to 0.6) through simulation and experimental demonstration. In both cases an average 16-fold increase in signal from the corrected beam is obtained. Our approach opens a pathway for compact, robust wavefront sensing that enhances range and accuracy of FSOC systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aya Ghoul, Kerstin Hammernik, Andreas Lingg, Patrick Krumm, Daniel Rueckert, Sergios Gatidis, Thomas K\"ustner</p>
<p>Abstract: In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), high temporal-resolved motion can be useful for image acquisition and reconstruction, MR-guided radiotherapy, dynamic contrast-enhancement, flow and perfusion imaging, and functional assessment of motion patterns in cardiovascular, abdominal, peristaltic, fetal, or musculoskeletal imaging. Conventionally, these motion estimates are derived through image-based registration, a particularly challenging task for complex motion patterns and high dynamic resolution. The accelerated scans in such applications result in imaging artifacts that compromise the motion estimation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised deep learning-based framework, dubbed the Local-All Pass Attention Network (LAPANet), for non-rigid motion estimation directly from the acquired accelerated Fourier space, i.e. k-space. The proposed approach models non-rigid motion as the cumulative sum of local translational displacements, following the Local All-Pass (LAP) registration technique. LAPANet was evaluated on cardiac motion estimation across various sampling trajectories and acceleration rates. Our results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to prior conventional and deep learning-based registration methods, accommodating as few as 2 lines/frame in a Cartesian trajectory and 3 spokes/frame in a non-Cartesian trajectory. The achieved high temporal resolution (less than 5 ms) for non-rigid motion opens new avenues for motion detection, tracking and correction in dynamic and real-time MRI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caelan Garrett, Ajay Mandlekar, Bowen Wen, Dieter Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective paradigm for robot manipulation, but acquiring large datasets is costly and resource-intensive, especially for long-horizon tasks. To address this issue, we propose SkillMimicGen (SkillGen), an automated system for generating demonstration datasets from a few human demos. SkillGen segments human demos into manipulation skills, adapts these skills to new contexts, and stitches them together through free-space transit and transfer motion. We also propose a Hybrid Skill Policy (HSP) framework for learning skill initiation, control, and termination components from SkillGen datasets, enabling skills to be sequenced using motion planning at test-time. We demonstrate that SkillGen greatly improves data generation and policy learning performance over a state-of-the-art data generation framework, resulting in the capability to produce data for large scene variations, including clutter, and agents that are on average 24% more successful. We demonstrate the efficacy of SkillGen by generating over 24K demonstrations across 18 task variants in simulation from just 60 human demonstrations, and training proficient, often near-perfect, HSP agents. Finally, we apply SkillGen to 3 real-world manipulation tasks and also demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a long-horizon assembly task. Videos, and more at https://skillgen.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vidhi Jain, Rishi Veerapaneni, Yonatan Bisk</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Audio Noise Awareness using Visuals of Indoors for NAVIgation for quieter robot path planning. While humans are naturally aware of the noise they make and its impact on those around them, robots currently lack this awareness. A key challenge in achieving audio awareness for robots is estimating how loud will the robot's actions be at a listener's location? Since sound depends upon the geometry and material composition of rooms, we train the robot to passively perceive loudness using visual observations of indoor environments. To this end, we generate data on how loud an 'impulse' sounds at different listener locations in simulated homes, and train our Acoustic Noise Predictor (ANP). Next, we collect acoustic profiles corresponding to different actions for navigation. Unifying ANP with action acoustics, we demonstrate experiments with wheeled (Hello Robot Stretch) and legged (Unitree Go2) robots so that these robots adhere to the noise constraints of the environment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Yun Wang, Zhengyang Geng, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models achieve superior generation quality but suffer from slow generation speed due to the iterative nature of denoising. In contrast, consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performance with significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either through consistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, or consistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose a novel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoising process of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framing consistency model training as the value estimation through Temporal Difference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyze the limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built upon Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT), which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity. SCT leads to significant performance improvements on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64. On ImageNet-64, SCT achieves 1-step FID 2.42 and 2-step FID 1.55, a new SoTA for consistency models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hirokatsu Kataoka, Kensho Hara, Yutaka Satoh</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of this paper is to evaluate "human action recognition without human". Motion representation is frequently discussed in human action recognition. We have examined several sophisticated options, such as dense trajectories (DT) and the two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN). However, some features from the background could be too strong, as shown in some recent studies on human action recognition. Therefore, we considered whether a background sequence alone can classify human actions in current large-scale action datasets (e.g., UCF101). In this paper, we propose a novel concept for human action analysis that is named "human action recognition without human". An experiment clearly shows the effect of a background sequence for understanding an action label.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui-Po Wang, Ning Yu, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show increasing performance and the level of realism is becoming indistinguishable from natural images, this also comes with high demands on data and computation. We show that state-of-the-art GAN models -- such as they are being publicly released by researchers and industry -- can be used for a range of applications beyond unconditional image generation. We achieve this by an iterative scheme that also allows gaining control over the image generation process despite the highly non-linear latent spaces of the latest GAN models. We demonstrate that this opens up the possibility to re-use state-of-the-art, difficult to train, pre-trained GANs with a high level of control even if only black-box access is granted. Our work also raises concerns and awareness that the use cases of a published GAN model may well reach beyond the creators' intention, which needs to be taken into account before a full public release.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khawar Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (video re-ID) has lately fascinated growing attention due to its broad practical applications in various areas, such as surveillance, smart city, and public safety. Nevertheless, video re-ID is quite difficult and is an ongoing stage due to numerous uncertain challenges such as viewpoint, occlusion, pose variation, and uncertain video sequence, etc. In the last couple of years, deep learning on video re-ID has continuously achieved surprising results on public datasets, with various approaches being developed to handle diverse problems in video re-ID. Compared to image-based re-ID, video re-ID is much more challenging and complex. To encourage future research and challenges, this first comprehensive paper introduces a review of up-to-date advancements in deep learning approaches for video re-ID. It broadly covers three important aspects, including brief video re-ID methods with their limitations, major milestones with technical challenges, and architectural design. It offers comparative performance analysis on various available datasets, guidance to improve video re-ID with valuable thoughts, and exciting research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azmine Toushik Wasi, Karlo \v{S}erbetar, Raima Islam, Taki Hasan Rafi, Dong-Kyu Chae</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework ARBEx, a novel attentive feature extraction framework driven by Vision Transformer with reliability balancing to cope against poor class distributions, bias, and uncertainty in the facial expression learning (FEL) task. We reinforce several data pre-processing and refinement methods along with a window-based cross-attention ViT to squeeze the best of the data. We also employ learnable anchor points in the embedding space with label distributions and multi-head self-attention mechanism to optimize performance against weak predictions with reliability balancing, which is a strategy that leverages anchor points, attention scores, and confidence values to enhance the resilience of label predictions. To ensure correct label classification and improve the models' discriminative power, we introduce anchor loss, which encourages large margins between anchor points. Additionally, the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which is also trainable, plays an integral role in identifying accurate labels. This approach provides critical elements for improving the reliability of predictions and has a substantial positive effect on final prediction capabilities. Our adaptive model can be integrated with any deep neural network to forestall challenges in various recognition tasks. Our strategy outperforms current state-of-the-art methodologies, according to extensive experiments conducted in a variety of contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zutao Jiang, Guian Fang, Jianhua Han, Guansong Lu, Hang Xu, Shengcai Liao, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality, realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these approaches have faced challenges in precisely aligning the generated visual content with the textual concepts described in the prompts. In this paper, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine semantic re-alignment method, named RealignDiff, aimed at improving the alignment between text and images in text-to-image diffusion models. In the coarse semantic re-alignment phase, a novel caption reward, leveraging the BLIP-2 model, is proposed to evaluate the semantic discrepancy between the generated image caption and the given text prompt. Subsequently, the fine semantic re-alignment stage employs a local dense caption generation module and a re-weighting attention modulation module to refine the previously generated images from a local semantic view. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and ViLG-300 datasets demonstrate that the proposed two-stage coarse-to-fine semantic re-alignment method outperforms other baseline re-alignment techniques by a substantial margin in both visual quality and semantic similarity with the input prompt.</p>

We demonstrate scalable simultaneous debiasing, style erasure, and content moderation by editing text-to-image projections, and we present extensive experiments demonstrating improved efficacy and scalability over prior work.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daichi Zhang, Zihao Xiao, Jianmin Li, Shiming Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Face forgery videos have caused severe public concerns, and many detectors have been proposed. However, most of these detectors suffer from limited generalization when detecting videos from unknown distributions, such as from unseen forgery methods. In this paper, we find that different forgery videos have distinct spatiotemporal patterns, which may be the key to generalization. To leverage this finding, we propose a Latent Spatiotemporal Adaptation~(LAST) approach to facilitate generalized face forgery video detection. The key idea is to optimize the detector adaptive to the spatiotemporal patterns of unknown videos in latent space to improve the generalization. Specifically, we first model the spatiotemporal patterns of face videos by incorporating a lightweight CNN to extract local spatial features of each frame and then cascading a vision transformer to learn the long-term spatiotemporal representations in latent space, which should contain more clues than in pixel space. Then by optimizing a transferable linear head to perform the usual forgery detection task on known videos and recover the spatiotemporal clues of unknown target videos in a semi-supervised manner, our detector could flexibly adapt to unknown videos' spatiotemporal patterns, leading to improved generalization. Additionally, to eliminate the influence of specific forgery videos, we pre-train our CNN and transformer only on real videos with two simple yet effective self-supervised tasks: reconstruction and contrastive learning in latent space and keep them frozen during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors with impressive generalization and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenning Shi, Haoshuai Zheng, Chen Xu, Changsheng Dong, Bin Pan, Xueshuo Xie, Along He, Tao Li, Huazhu Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Wan, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent large-scale T2I models like DALLE-3 have made progress in reducing gender stereotypes when generating single-person images. However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the Paired Stereotype Test (PST) framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. "a CEO" and "an Assistant"). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases -- the well-known bias in gendered occupation and a novel aspect: bias in organizational power. Experiments show that over 74% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose FairCritic, a novel and interpretable framework that leverages an LLM-based critic model to i) detect bias in generated images, and ii) adaptively provide feedback to T2I models for improving fairness. FairCritic achieves near-perfect fairness on PST, overcoming the limitations of previous prompt-based intervention approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, an image enhancement methodology designed to enhance the clarity of small intestinal villi in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. This method first separates the low-frequency and high-frequency components of small intestinal villi images using guided filtering. Subsequently, an adaptive light gain factor is generated based on the low-frequency component, and an adaptive gradient gain factor is derived from the convolution results of the Laplacian operator in different regions of small intestinal villi images. The obtained light gain factor and gradient gain factor are then combined to enhance the high-frequency components. Finally, the enhanced high-frequency component is fused with the original image to achieve adaptive sharpening of the edges of WCE small intestinal villi images. The experiments affirm that, compared to established WCE image enhancement methods, our approach not only accentuates the edge details of WCE small intestine villi images but also skillfully suppresses noise amplification, thereby preventing the occurrence of edge overshooting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangming Shi, Xiangbo Yin, Yachao Zhang, Zhizhong Zhang, Yuan Xie, Yanyun Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to match specified people in infrared images to visible images without annotations, and vice versa. USVI-ReID is a challenging yet under-explored task. Most existing methods address the USVI-ReID using cluster-based contrastive learning, which simply employs the cluster center as a representation of a person. However, the cluster center primarily focuses on commonality, overlooking divergence and variety. To address the problem, we propose a Progressive Contrastive Learning with Hard and Dynamic Prototypes method for USVI-ReID. In brief, we generate the hard prototype by selecting the sample with the maximum distance from the cluster center. We theoretically show that the hard prototype is used in the contrastive loss to emphasize divergence. Additionally, instead of rigidly aligning query images to a specific prototype, we generate the dynamic prototype by randomly picking samples within a cluster. The dynamic prototype is used to encourage the variety. Finally, we introduce a progressive learning strategy to gradually shift the model's attention towards divergence and variety, avoiding cluster deterioration. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is a challenging and hot issue due to the large amount of unlabeled data. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has proven to be advantageous in incorporating unclassified information from the target domain. However, independently fine-tuning UDA models on the source and target domains has a limited effect on the outcome. This paper proposes a hybrid training strategy as well as a novel dual-domain image fusion strategy that effectively utilizes the original image, transformation image, and intermediate domain information. Moreover, to enhance the precision of pseudo-labels, we present a pseudo-label region-specific weight strategy. The efficacy of our approach is substantiated by extensive benchmark experiments and ablation studies conducted on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangkai Xu, Yongtao Ge, Mingyu Liu, Chengxiang Fan, Kangyang Xie, Zhiyue Zhao, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Extensive pre-training with large data is indispensable for downstream geometry and semantic visual perception tasks. Thanks to large-scale text-to-image (T2I) pretraining, recent works show promising results by simply fine-tuning T2I diffusion models for dense perception tasks. However, several crucial design decisions in this process still lack comprehensive justification, encompassing the necessity of the multi-step stochastic diffusion mechanism, training strategy, inference ensemble strategy, and fine-tuning data quality. In this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into critical factors that affect transfer efficiency and performance when using diffusion priors. Our key findings are: 1) High-quality fine-tuning data is paramount for both semantic and geometry perception tasks. 2) The stochastic nature of diffusion models has a slightly negative impact on deterministic visual perception tasks. 3) Apart from fine-tuning the diffusion model with only latent space supervision, task-specific image-level supervision is beneficial to enhance fine-grained details. These observations culminate in the development of GenPercept, an effective deterministic one-step fine-tuning paradigm tailed for dense visual perception tasks. Different from the previous multi-step methods, our paradigm has a much faster inference speed, and can be seamlessly integrated with customized perception decoders and loss functions for image-level supervision, which is critical to improving the fine-grained details of predictions. Comprehensive experiments on diverse dense visual perceptual tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, image segmentation, and matting, are performed to demonstrate the remarkable adaptability and effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Camera calibration in broadcast sports videos presents numerous challenges for accurate sports field registration due to multiple camera angles, varying camera parameters, and frequent occlusions of the field. Traditional search-based methods depend on initial camera pose estimates, which can struggle in non-standard positions and dynamic environments. In response, we propose an optimization-based calibration pipeline that leverages a 3D soccer field model and a predefined set of keypoints to overcome these limitations. Our method also introduces a novel refinement module that improves initial calibration by using detected field lines in a non-linear optimization process. This approach outperforms existing techniques in both multi-view and single-view 3D camera calibration tasks, while maintaining competitive performance in homography estimation. Extensive experimentation on real-world soccer datasets, including SoccerNet-Calibration, WorldCup 2014, and TS-WorldCup, highlights the robustness and accuracy of our method across diverse broadcast scenarios. Our approach offers significant improvements in camera calibration precision and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study cultural and socioeconomic diversity in contrastive vision-language models (VLMs). Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, we bring to attention several important findings. First, the common filtering of training data to English image-text pairs disadvantages communities of lower socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this performance gap is not captured by - and even at odds with - the currently popular evaluation metrics derived from the Western-centric ImageNet and COCO datasets. Second, pretraining with global, unfiltered data before fine-tuning on English content can improve cultural understanding without sacrificing performance on said popular benchmarks. Third, we introduce the task of geo-localization as a novel evaluation metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs. Our work underscores the value of using diverse data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ido Sobol, Chenfeng Xu, Or Litany</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic images from arbitrary views based on a single source image remains a significant challenge in computer vision, with broad applications ranging from e-commerce to immersive virtual experiences. Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the Zero-1-to-3 model, have been widely adopted for generating plausible views, videos, and 3D models. However, these models still struggle with inconsistencies and implausibility in new views generation, especially for challenging changes in viewpoint. In this work, we propose Zero-to-Hero, a novel test-time approach that enhances view synthesis by manipulating attention maps during the denoising process of Zero-1-to-3. By drawing an analogy between the denoising process and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we implement a filtering mechanism that aggregates attention maps, enhancing generation reliability and authenticity. This process improves geometric consistency without requiring retraining or significant computational resources. Additionally, we modify the self-attention mechanism to integrate information from the source view, reducing shape distortions. These processes are further supported by a specialized sampling schedule. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in fidelity and consistency, validated on a diverse set of out-of-distribution objects. Additionally, we demonstrate the general applicability and effectiveness of Zero-to-Hero in multi-view, and image generation conditioned on semantic maps and pose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom\'a\v{s} Voj\'i\v{r}, Jan \v{S}ochman, Ji\v{r}\'i Matas</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a dense image prediction out-of-distribution detection algorithm, called PixOOD, which does not require training on samples of anomalous data and is not designed for a specific application which avoids traditional training biases. In order to model the complex intra-class variability of the in-distribution data at the pixel level, we propose an online data condensation algorithm which is more robust than standard K-means and is easily trainable through SGD. We evaluate PixOOD on a wide range of problems. It achieved state-of-the-art results on four out of seven datasets, while being competitive on the rest.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Athanasios Tragakis, Marco Aversa, Chaitanya Kaul, Roderick Murray-Smith, Daniele Faccio</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Pixelsmith, a zero-shot text-to-image generative framework to sample images at higher resolutions with a single GPU. We are the first to show that it is possible to scale the output of a pre-trained diffusion model by a factor of 1000, opening the road for gigapixel image generation at no additional cost. Our cascading method uses the image generated at the lowest resolution as a baseline to sample at higher resolutions. For the guidance, we introduce the Slider, a tunable mechanism that fuses the overall structure contained in the first-generated image with enhanced fine details. At each inference step, we denoise patches rather than the entire latent space, minimizing memory demands such that a single GPU can handle the process, regardless of the image's resolution. Our experimental results show that Pixelsmith not only achieves higher quality and diversity compared to existing techniques, but also reduces sampling time and artifacts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marian Longa, Jo\~ao F. Henriques</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised object detection using deep neural networks is typically a difficult problem with few to no guarantees about the learned representation. In this work we present the first unsupervised object detection method that is theoretically guaranteed to recover the true object positions up to quantifiable small shifts. We develop an unsupervised object detection architecture and prove that the learned variables correspond to the true object positions up to small shifts related to the encoder and decoder receptive field sizes, the object sizes, and the widths of the Gaussians used in the rendering process. We perform detailed analysis of how the error depends on each of these variables and perform synthetic experiments validating our theoretical predictions up to a precision of individual pixels. We also perform experiments on CLEVR-based data and show that, unlike current SOTA object detection methods (SAM, CutLER), our method's prediction errors always lie within our theoretical bounds. We hope that this work helps open up an avenue of research into object detection methods with theoretical guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijia Zhao, Haoyu Lu, Yuqi Huo, Yifan Du, Tongtian Yue, Longteng Guo, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video understanding is a crucial next step for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Various benchmarks are introduced for better evaluating the MLLMs. Nevertheless, current video benchmarks are still inefficient for evaluating video models during iterative development due to the high cost of constructing datasets and the difficulty in isolating specific skills. In this paper, we propose VideoNIAH (Video Needle In A Haystack), a benchmark construction framework through synthetic video generation. VideoNIAH decouples video content from their query-responses by inserting unrelated visual 'needles' into original videos. The framework automates the generation of query-response pairs using predefined rules, minimizing manual labor. The queries focus on specific aspects of video understanding, enabling more skill-specific evaluations. The separation between video content and the queries also allow for increased video variety and evaluations across different lengths. Utilizing VideoNIAH, we compile a video benchmark VNBench, which includes tasks such as retrieval, ordering, and counting to evaluate three key aspects of video understanding: temporal perception, chronological ordering, and spatio-temporal coherence. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both proprietary and open-source models, uncovering significant differences in their video understanding capabilities across various tasks. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the test results and model configurations. Based on these findings, we provide some advice for improving video MLLM training, offering valuable insights to guide future research and model development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Yu, Changyong Shu, Qianpu Sun, Yifan Bian, Xiaobao Wei, Jiangyong Yu, Zongdai Liu, Dawei Yang, Hui Li, Yan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoptic occupancy poses a novel challenge by aiming to integrate instance occupancy and semantic occupancy within a unified framework. However, there is still a lack of efficient solutions for panoptic occupancy. In this paper, we propose Panoptic-FlashOcc, a straightforward yet robust 2D feature framework that enables realtime panoptic occupancy. Building upon the lightweight design of FlashOcc, our approach simultaneously learns semantic occupancy and class-aware instance clustering in a single network, these outputs are jointly incorporated through panoptic occupancy procession for panoptic occupancy. This approach effectively addresses the drawbacks of high memory and computation requirements associated with three-dimensional voxel-level representations. With its straightforward and efficient design that facilitates easy deployment, Panoptic-FlashOcc demonstrates remarkable achievements in panoptic occupancy prediction. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, it achieves exceptional performance, with 38.5 RayIoU and 29.1 mIoU for semantic occupancy, operating at a rapid speed of 43.9 FPS. Furthermore, it attains a notable score of 16.0 RayPQ for panoptic occupancy, accompanied by a fast inference speed of 30.2 FPS. These results surpass the performance of existing methodologies in terms of both speed and accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Quarez, Marc Modat, Sebastien Ourselin, Jonathan Shapey, Alejandro Granados</p>
<p>Abstract: In surgical skill assessment, the Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS) and Global Rating Scale (GRS) are well-established tools for evaluating surgeons during training. These metrics, along with performance feedback, help surgeons improve and reach practice standards. Recent research on the open-source JIGSAWS dataset, which includes both GRS and OSATS labels, has focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic data, video, or their combination. However, we argue that regressing GRS alone is limiting, as it aggregates OSATS scores and overlooks clinically meaningful variations during a surgical trial. To address this, we developed a recurrent transformer model that tracks a surgeon's performance throughout a session by mapping hidden states to six OSATS, derived from kinematic data, using a clinically motivated objective function. These OSATS scores are averaged to predict GRS, allowing us to compare our model's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficients (SCC) demonstrating that our model outperforms SOTA using kinematic data (SCC 0.83-0.88), and matches performance with video-based models. Our model also surpasses SOTA in most tasks for average OSATS predictions (SCC 0.46-0.70) and specific OSATS (SCC 0.56-0.95). The generation of pseudo-labels at the segment level translates quantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, vital for automated surgical skill assessment pipelines. A senior surgeon validated our model's outputs, agreeing with 77% of the weakly-supervised predictions (p=0.006).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Li, Jingbo Chen, Yupeng Deng, Yu Meng, Diyou Liu, Junxian Ma, Chenhao Wang, Xiangyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Building Footprint Extraction (BFE) from off-nadir aerial images often involves roof segmentation and offset prediction to adjust roof boundaries to the building footprint. However, this multi-stage approach typically produces low-quality results, limiting its applicability in real-world data production. To address this issue, we present OBMv2, an end-to-end and promptable model for polygonal footprint prediction. Unlike its predecessor OBM, OBMv2 introduces a novel Self Offset Attention (SOFA) mechanism that improves performance across diverse building types, from bungalows to skyscrapers, enabling end-to-end footprint prediction without post-processing. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Information System (MISS) to effectively leverage roof masks, building masks, and offsets for accurate footprint prediction. We evaluate OBMv2 on the BONAI and OmniCity-view3 datasets and demonstrate its generalization on the Huizhou test set. The code will be available at https://github.com/likaiucas/OBMv2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangdong Zhang, Shaofeng Zhang, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked autoencoder has been widely explored in point cloud self-supervised learning, whereby the point cloud is generally divided into visible and masked parts. These methods typically include an encoder accepting visible patches (normalized) and corresponding patch centers (position) as input, with the decoder accepting the output of the encoder and the centers (position) of the masked parts to reconstruct each point in the masked patches. Then, the pre-trained encoders are used for downstream tasks. In this paper, we show a motivating empirical result that when directly feeding the centers of masked patches to the decoder without information from the encoder, it still reconstructs well. In other words, the centers of patches are important and the reconstruction objective does not necessarily rely on representations of the encoder, thus preventing the encoder from learning semantic representations. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, i.e., learning to Predict Centers for Point Masked AutoEncoders (PCP-MAE) which guides the model to learn to predict the significant centers and use the predicted centers to replace the directly provided centers. Specifically, we propose a Predicting Center Module (PCM) that shares parameters with the original encoder with extra cross-attention to predict centers. Our method is of high pre-training efficiency compared to other alternatives and achieves great improvement over Point-MAE, particularly surpassing it by 5.50% on OBJ-BG, 6.03% on OBJ-ONLY, and 5.17% on PB-T50-RS for 3D object classification on the ScanObjectNN dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Li, Jianqing Xu, Jiaying Wu, Miao Xiong, Ailin Deng, Jiazhen Ji, Yuge Huang, Wenjie Feng, Shouhong Ding, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic face recognition (SFR) aims to generate synthetic face datasets that mimic the distribution of real face data, which allows for training face recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. Despite the remarkable potential of diffusion models in image generation, current diffusion-based SFR models struggle with generalization to real-world faces. To address this limitation, we outline three key objectives for SFR: (1) promoting diversity across identities (inter-class diversity), (2) ensuring diversity within each identity by injecting various facial attributes (intra-class diversity), and (3) maintaining identity consistency within each identity group (intra-class identity preservation). Inspired by these goals, we introduce a diffusion-fueled SFR model termed $\text{ID}^3$. $\text{ID}^3$ employs an ID-preserving loss to generate diverse yet identity-consistent facial appearances. Theoretically, we show that minimizing this loss is equivalent to maximizing the lower bound of an adjusted conditional log-likelihood over ID-preserving data. This equivalence motivates an ID-preserving sampling algorithm, which operates over an adjusted gradient vector field, enabling the generation of fake face recognition datasets that approximate the distribution of real-world faces. Extensive experiments across five challenging benchmarks validate the advantages of $\text{ID}^3$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fundus image classification is crucial in the computer aided diagnosis tasks, but label noise significantly impairs the performance of deep neural networks. To address this challenge, we propose a robust framework, Self-Supervised Pre-training with Robust Adaptive Credal Loss (SSP-RACL), for handling label noise in fundus image datasets. First, we use Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for pre-training to extract features, unaffected by label noise. Subsequently, RACL employ a superset learning framework, setting confidence thresholds and adaptive label relaxation parameter to construct possibility distributions and provide more reliable ground-truth estimates, thus effectively suppressing the memorization effect. Additionally, we introduce clinical knowledge-based asymmetric noise generation to simulate real-world noisy fundus image datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches in handling label noise, showing superior performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Matsuda, Yuiga Wada, Komei Sugiura</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of developing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning, with a particular focus on robustness against hallucinations. Existing metrics are often inadequate for handling hallucinations, primarily due to their limited ability to compare candidate captions with multifaceted reference captions. To address this shortcoming, we propose DENEB, a novel supervised automatic evaluation metric specifically robust against hallucinations. DENEB incorporates the Sim-Vec Transformer, a mechanism that processes multiple references simultaneously, thereby efficiently capturing the similarity between an image, a candidate caption, and reference captions. To train DENEB, we construct the diverse and balanced Nebula dataset comprising 32,978 images, paired with human judgments provided by 805 annotators. We demonstrated that DENEB achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing LLM-free metrics on the FOIL, Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and PASCAL-50S datasets, validating its effectiveness and robustness against hallucinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Fan, Fujun Luan, Jian Yang, Milo\v{s} Ha\v{s}an, Beibei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown its impressive power in novel view synthesis. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (e.g., fur), is still a challenging task. For these scenes, the decomposition between the light, geometry, and material is more ambiguous, as neither the surface constraints nor the analytical shading model hold. To address this issue, we propose RNG, a novel representation of relightable neural Gaussians, enabling the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or fluffy boundaries. We avoid any assumptions in the shading model but maintain feature vectors, which can be further decoded by an MLP into colors, in each Gaussian point. Following prior work, we utilize a point light to reduce the ambiguity and introduce a shadow-aware condition to the network. We additionally propose a depth refinement network to help the shadow computation under the 3DGS framework, leading to better shadow effects under point lights. Furthermore, to avoid the blurriness brought by the alpha-blending in 3DGS, we design a hybrid forward-deferred optimization strategy. As a result, we achieve about $20\times$ faster in training and about $600\times$ faster in rendering than prior work based on neural radiance fields, with $60$ frames per second on an RTX4090.</p>

<p>Abstract: In our study, we explore methods for detecting unwanted content lurking in visual datasets. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a model capable of successfully partitioning visual data can be obtained using only textual data.

HFTT features an innovative objective function that significantly reduces the necessity for human involvement in data annotation. Furthermore, HFTT employs a clever textual data synthesis method, effectively emulating the integration of unknown visual data distribution into the training process at no extra cost. The unique characteristics of HFTT extend its utility beyond traditional out-of-distribution detection, making it applicable to tasks that address more abstract concepts.

<p>Abstract: Current benchmarks for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) often focus on their perception or problem-solving capabilities and neglect other critical aspects such as fairness, multilinguality, or toxicity. Furthermore, they differ in their evaluation procedures and the scope of the evaluation, making it difficult to compare models. To address these issues, we extend the HELM framework to VLMs to present the Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models (VHELM). VHELM aggregates various datasets to cover one or more of the 9 aspects: visual perception, knowledge, reasoning, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. In doing so, we produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the capabilities of the VLMs across these important factors. In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons across models. Our framework is designed to be lightweight and automatic so that evaluation runs are cheap and fast. Our initial run evaluates 22 VLMs on 21 existing datasets to provide a holistic snapshot of the models. We uncover new key findings, such as the fact that efficiency-focused models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku or Gemini 1.5 Flash) perform significantly worse than their full models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus or Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the bias benchmark but not when evaluated on the other aspects. For transparency, we release the raw model generations and complete results on our website (https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/vhelm/v2.0.1). VHELM is intended to be a living benchmark, and we hope to continue adding new datasets and models over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Hao, Yanxi Wang, Zhigang Chang, Hongmin Gao, Zihao Cheng, Chen Wu, Xin Zhao, Peiye Fang, Rachmat Muwardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Gait recognition is a remote biometric technology that utilizes the dynamic characteristics of human movement to identify individuals even under various extreme lighting conditions. Due to the limitation in spatial perception capability inherent in 2D gait representations, LiDAR can directly capture 3D gait features and represent them as point clouds, reducing environmental and lighting interference in recognition while significantly advancing privacy protection. For complex 3D representations, shallow networks fail to achieve accurate recognition, making vision Transformers the foremost prevalent method. However, the prevalence of dumb patches has limited the widespread use of Transformer architecture in gait recognition. This paper proposes a method named HorGait, which utilizes a hybrid model with a Transformer architecture for gait recognition on the planar projection of 3D point clouds from LiDAR. Specifically, it employs a hybrid model structure called LHM Block to achieve input adaptation, long-range, and high-order spatial interaction of the Transformer architecture. Additionally, it uses large convolutional kernel CNNs to segment the input representation, replacing attention windows to reduce dumb patches. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that HorGait achieves state-of-the-art performance among Transformer architecture methods on the SUSTech1K dataset, verifying that the hybrid model can complete the full Transformer process and perform better in point cloud planar projection. The outstanding performance of HorGait offers new insights for the future application of the Transformer architecture in gait recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Antonov, Andrey Moskalenko, Denis Shepelev, Alexander Krapukhin, Konstantin Soshin, Anton Konushin, Vlad Shakhuro</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Segment Anything (SAM) sparked research interest in the field of interactive segmentation, especially in the context of image editing tasks and speeding up data annotation. Unlike common semantic segmentation, interactive segmentation methods allow users to directly influence their output through prompts (e.g. clicks). However, click patterns in real-world interactive segmentation scenarios remain largely unexplored. Most methods rely on the assumption that users would click in the center of the largest erroneous area. Nevertheless, recent studies show that this is not always the case. Thus, methods may have poor performance in real-world deployment despite high metrics in a baseline benchmark. To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted a large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation scenario and collected 475K real-user clicks. Drawing on ideas from saliency tasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which closely resemble actual user inputs. Using our model and dataset, we propose RClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive segmentation methods on realistic clicks. Specifically, we evaluate not only the average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. click patterns. According to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models may perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most of the methods are not robust. We believe that RClicks is a significant step towards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user experience in real-world cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Chen, Guoan Wang, Yuanfeng Ji, Yanjun Li, Jin Ye, Tianbin Li, Bin Zhang, Nana Pei, Rongshan Yu, Yu Qiao, Junjun He</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). We will fully release SlideChat, SlideInstruction and SlideBench as open-source resources to facilitate research and development in computational pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengji Zhang, Linquan Wu, Huiyu Bai, Guancheng Lin, Xiao Li, Xiao Yu, Yue Wang, Bei Chen, Jacky Keung</p>
<p>Abstract: Coding tasks have been valuable for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), as they demand the comprehension of high-level instructions, complex reasoning, and the implementation of functional programs -- core capabilities for advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which extend LLMs with visual perception and understanding capabilities, there remains a notable lack of coding benchmarks that rigorously assess these models, particularly in tasks that emphasize visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce HumanEval-V, a novel and lightweight benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' visual understanding and reasoning capabilities through code generation. HumanEval-V includes 108 carefully crafted, entry-level Python coding tasks derived from platforms like CodeForces and Stack Overflow. Each task is adapted by modifying the context and algorithmic patterns of the original problems, with visual elements redrawn to ensure distinction from the source, preventing potential data leakage. LMMs are required to complete the code solution based on the provided visual context and a predefined Python function signature outlining the task requirements. Every task is equipped with meticulously handcrafted test cases to ensure a thorough and reliable evaluation of model-generated solutions. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LMMs using HumanEval-V, uncovering significant challenges. Proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve only 13% pass@1 and 36.4% pass@10, while open-weight models with 70B parameters score below 4% pass@1. Ablation studies further reveal the limitations of current LMMs in vision reasoning and coding capabilities. These results underscore key areas for future research to enhance LMMs' capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Lu, Jiacheng Deng, Ruijie Zhu, Yanzhe Liang, Wenfei Yang, Tianzhu Zhang, Xu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic scenes rendering is an intriguing yet challenging problem. Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nghia Hieu Nguyen, Tho Thanh Quan, Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based VQA is a challenging task that requires machines to use scene texts in given images to yield the most appropriate answer for the given question. The main challenge of text-based VQA is exploiting the meaning and information from scene texts. Recent studies tackled this challenge by considering the spatial information of scene texts in images via embedding 2D coordinates of their bounding boxes. In this study, we follow the definition of meaning from linguistics to introduce a novel method that effectively exploits the information from scene texts written in Vietnamese. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtains state-of-the-art results on two large-scale Vietnamese Text-based VQA datasets. The implementation can be found at this link.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taolin Zhang, Jinpeng Wang, Hang Guo, Tao Dai, Bin Chen, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptation of pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP to various downstream tasks have raised great interest in recent researches. Previous works have proposed a variety of test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to achieve strong generalization without any knowledge of the target domain. However, existing training-required TTA approaches like TPT necessitate entropy minimization that involves large computational overhead, while training-free methods like TDA overlook the potential for information mining from the test samples themselves. In this paper, we break down the design of existing popular training-required and training-free TTA methods and bridge the gap between them within our framework. Specifically, we maintain a light-weight key-value memory for feature retrieval from instance-agnostic historical samples and instance-aware boosting samples. The historical samples are filtered from the testing data stream and serve to extract useful information from the target distribution, while the boosting samples are drawn from regional bootstrapping and capture the knowledge of the test sample itself. We theoretically justify the rationality behind our method and empirically verify its effectiveness on both the out-of-distribution and the cross-domain datasets, showcasing its applicability in real-world situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Dangel</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their simple intuition, convolutions are more tedious to analyze than dense layers, which complicates the transfer of theoretical and algorithmic ideas to convolutions. We simplify convolutions by viewing them as tensor networks (TNs) that allow reasoning about the underlying tensor multiplications by drawing diagrams, manipulating them to perform function transformations like differentiation, and efficiently evaluating them with einsum. To demonstrate their simplicity and expressiveness, we derive diagrams of various autodiff operations and popular curvature approximations with full hyper-parameter support, batching, channel groups, and generalization to any convolution dimension. Further, we provide convolution-specific transformations based on the connectivity pattern which allow to simplify diagrams before evaluation. Finally, we probe performance. Our TN implementation accelerates a recently-proposed KFAC variant up to 4.5x while removing the standard implementation's memory overhead, and enables new hardware-efficient tensor dropout for approximate backpropagation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiji Zhao, Xizhe Wang, Ranjie Duan, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely proved to be an effective method to improve the adversarial robustness against adversarial examples for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has demonstrated its superior performance in improving the robustness of small student models with the guidance of large teacher models. However, both AT and ARD encounter the robust fairness problem: these models exhibit strong robustness when facing part of classes (easy class), but weak robustness when facing others (hard class). In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of the potential factors and argue that the smoothness degree of samples' soft labels for different classes (i.e., hard class or easy class) will affect the robust fairness of DNNs from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above finding, we propose an Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) method to mitigate the adversarial robust fairness problem within the framework of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes to achieve fairness by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of samples' soft labels during the training process, and the smoothness degree of soft labels is controlled by assigning different temperatures in KD to different classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art AT, ARD, and robust fairness methods in the comprehensive metric (Normalized Standard Deviation) of robustness and fairness.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177">One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongyuan Wu, Lingchen Sun, Zhiyuan Ma, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model-based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moayed Haji-Ali, Willi Menapace, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Guha Balakrishnan, Sergey Tulyakov, Vicente Ordonez</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating ambient sounds is a challenging task due to data scarcity and often insufficient caption quality, making it difficult to employ large-scale generative models for the task. In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing two new models. First, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality and efficient automatic audio captioning model. By using a compact audio representation and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of 83.2, marking a 3.2% improvement from the best available captioning model at four times faster inference speed. Second, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. Using AutoCap to generate caption clips from existing audio datasets, we demonstrate the benefits of data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to state-of-the-art audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of 4.7% in FAD score, 22.7% in IS, and 13.5% in CLAP score, indicating significantly improved quality of generated audio compared to previous works. Moreover, we propose an efficient and scalable pipeline for collecting audio datasets, enabling us to compile 57M ambient audio clips, forming AutoReCap-XL, the largest available audio-text dataset, at 90 times the scale of existing ones. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Wan, Di Wu, Haoran Wang, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-based "diversity interventions" are commonly adopted to improve the diversity of Text-to-Image (T2I) models depicting individuals with various racial or gender traits. However, will this strategy result in nonfactual demographic distribution, especially when generating real historical figures. In this work, we propose DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR), a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in T2I models. DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3's generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose Fact-Augmented Intervention (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on verbalized or retrieved factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history, and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI significantly improves the demographic factuality under diversity interventions while preserving diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Th\'eo Uscidda, Luca Eyring, Karsten Roth, Fabian Theis, Zeynep Akata, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. Although remarkably challenging to solve in theory, disentanglement is often achieved in practice through prior matching. Furthermore, recent works have shown that prior matching approaches can be enhanced by leveraging geometrical considerations, e.g., by learning representations that preserve geometric features of the data, such as distances or angles between points. However, matching the prior while preserving geometric features is challenging, as a mapping that fully preserves these features while aligning the data distribution with the prior does not exist in general. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach to disentangled representation learning based on quadratic optimal transport. We formulate the problem using Gromov-Monge maps that transport one distribution onto another with minimal distortion of predefined geometric features, preserving them as much as can be achieved. To compute such maps, we propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer quantifying whether a map moves a reference distribution with minimal geometry distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for disentanglement across four standard benchmarks, outperforming other methods leveraging geometric considerations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reference metrics have been developed to objectively and quantitatively compare two images. Especially for evaluating the quality of reconstructed or compressed images, these metrics have shown very useful. Extensive tests of such metrics on benchmarks of artificially distorted natural images have revealed which metric best correlate with human perception of quality. Direct transfer of these metrics to the evaluation of generative models in medical imaging, however, can easily lead to pitfalls, because assumptions about image content, image data format and image interpretation are often very different. Also, the correlation of reference metrics and human perception of quality can vary strongly for different kinds of distortions and commonly used metrics, such as SSIM, PSNR and MAE are not the best choice for all situations. We selected five pitfalls that showcase unexpected and probably undesired reference metric scores and discuss strategies to avoid them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Garske, Bradley Evans, Christopher Artlett, KC Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting unexpected objects (anomalies) in real time has great potential for monitoring, managing, and protecting the environment. Hyperspectral line-scan cameras are a low-cost solution that enhance confidence in anomaly detection over RGB and multispectral imagery. However, existing line-scan algorithms are too slow when using small computers (e.g. those onboard a drone or small satellite), do not adapt to changing scenery, or lack robustness against geometric distortions. This paper introduces the Exponentially moving RX algorithm (ERX) to address these issues, and compares it with existing RX-based anomaly detection methods for hyperspectral line scanning. Three large and more complex datasets are also introduced to better assess the practical challenges when using line-scan cameras (two hyperspectral and one multispectral). ERX is evaluated using a Jetson Xavier NX compute module, achieving the best combination of speed and detection performance. This research paves the way for future studies in grouping and locating anomalous objects, adaptive and automatic threshold selection, and real-time field tests.

<p>Abstract: Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks.
  To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights.
  This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p>

<p>Abstract: With models getting stronger, evaluations have grown more complex, testing multiple skills in one benchmark and even in the same instance at once. However, skill-wise performance is obscured when inspecting aggregate accuracy, under-utilizing the rich signal modern benchmarks contain. We propose an automatic approach to recover the underlying skills relevant for any evaluation instance, by way of inspecting model-generated rationales. After validating the relevance of rationale-parsed skills and inferring skills for $46$k instances over $12$ benchmarks, we observe many skills to be common across benchmarks, resulting in the curation of hundreds of skill-slices (i.e. sets of instances testing a common skill). Inspecting accuracy over these slices yields novel insights on model trade-offs: e.g., compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on average, Gemini 1.5 Pro is $18\%$ more accurate in "computing molar mass", but $19\%$ less accurate in "applying constitutional law", despite the overall accuracies of the three models differing by a mere $0.4\%$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by showing that insights derived from skill slice analysis can generalize to held-out instances: when routing each instance to the model strongest on the relevant skills, we see a $3\%$ accuracy improvement over our $12$ dataset corpus. Our skill-slices and framework open a new avenue in model evaluation, leveraging skill-specific analyses to unlock a more granular and actionable understanding of model capabilities.</p>
